          walt sits at the kitchen table in his robe, drinking
          coffee. tao comes in without even knocking on the door.

          tao
          what are you doing?

          walt
          i'm thinking.

          tao
          thinking time is over. now it's
          time to knock the ass out of those
          pricks.

          walt
          i know you don't want to hear
          this, but you have to calm down.

          tao
          what?!

          101.

          walt
          you have to have a clear head,
          otherwise mistakes get made. back
          away from what's happened, tao.

          tao
          no. don't let me down, walt. not
          you. this is going to end, today.
          walt stands up and pulls out a chair for tao to sit in.

          walt
          sit down.

          tao
          i don't want to sit.

          walt
          i said sit down! just listen up
          for a second and don't say
          anything.
          tao sits down. walt rubs his hands together.

          walt
          i know what needs to be done. i
          need to prepare, this needs to be
          carefully planned. you know i'm
          the right man for this. so cool
          down for a little while and meet
          me back here at 4 p.m. i promise
          you, what needs to be done, will
          be done.

          tao
          i say we go now. right now.

          walt
          and do what? you want to go kill
          your cousin and those other zips.
          mr. tough-guy-all-of-a-sudden is
          out for blood. what do you even
          know about it?
          tao is furious, but says nothing.

          walt
          trust me, tao. cool down and
          we'll meet back here at four.
          okay?
          tao doesn't answer.

          102.

          anything without me. you meet me
          back here at four? say okay.'

          tao
