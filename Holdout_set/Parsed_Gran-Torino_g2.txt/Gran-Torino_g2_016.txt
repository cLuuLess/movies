          tao walks down the street, his head in a book. he
          finally realizes there's a blue chevy following slowly
          behind him.
          the blue chevy is now parallel with tao and keeps pace
          with his step. tao looks over to the occupants of the
          chevy.
          it's two latinos. tao quickens his pace, but the chevy
          easily keeps up with tao.

          latino driver
          is you a boy or a girl, i can't
          tell?

          latino #2
          what you reading, gook, jackass
          and the rice stalk?
          tao laughs, but keeps walking.

          latino driver
          that's right, you keep walking.
          fucking slopes everywhere you
          look, man. why gooks come up in
          here and fuck up our neighborhood?
          down the street -- is a suped-up honda civic with a big
          spoiler on the back. inside are five hmong gangbangers.
          the hmong gangbangers notice tao being followed by the
          latinos. spider, the driver, squints and then points at
          tao.

          spider
          dude, that's my little cousin,
          tao.

          smokie
          you sure about that, spider?

          spider
          i'm sure. do we do something...
          or what?
          smokie is the gang leader. he looks at tao for a second.

          smokie
          your cousin tight with anyone?

          spider
          no, he flies solo, smokie.

          smokie
          okay. let's go help out our
          little cousin.
          smokie nods to spider, they roar up and stop right across
          from tao and the latinos' car.

          smokie
          you better not be giving my bro
          here a hard time or you're gonna
          wish you never been born.

          latino driver
          oh goody, more rice niggers.
          the latino driver smiles and flashes a pistol.
          a hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays
          a sub-machine gun. the latinos are way out-gunned.

          latino #2
          fucking viet cong swamp rats. go
          back to your fucking rice paddy.
          the latinos screech their tires and are gone. the hmongs
          in the car smile and congratulate themselves.
          tao simply keeps walking down the street!

          smokie
          where the fuck does he think he's
          going? turn us around and go
          after that cousin of yours.
          they swing a u-turn and pull up to tao, keeping pace with
          him as he walks.

          spider
          hey, cuz, slow down, where you
          going? you should really think
          about hanging with us, man. if we
          all stick together, shit like that
          won't happen, with those spicks.
          tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer.

          spider
          you can't be such a little girl.
          you join up with us, we'll keep
          you out of trouble, cuz.

          15.

          tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the hmong
          gangbanger in the back seat.
          smokie takes this all in. he looks down the street and
          sees that in a half block, tao will have to pass a group
          of latino gangbanger types.

          smokie
          you think about it and we'll see
          you tomorrow.
