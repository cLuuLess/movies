          we're at the funeral of walter kowalski. walt is dressed
          in his new suit.
          along with the crowd you'd expect, tao and sue are seated
          near the front.
          walt's sons and family are there. mitch gives tao a
          dirty look. tao looks back at him, his gaze bores right
          through mitch. mitch looks away.
          father janovich steps up to the pulpit and speaks.

          father janovich
          walt kowalski once said to me i
          didn't know anything about life or
          death because i was an
          overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
          who held the hands of
          superstitious old women and
          promised them eternity.' walt
          definitely had no problem calling
          it like he saw it.' but walt was
          right. i knew really nothing
          about life or death until i got to
          know walt. and boy, did i learn.
