          ext. walt's driveway - evening

          dusk is falling. walt finally gets up, folds up his lawn
          chair and walks stiffly back into the garage.
          walt flips on the outdoor light, highlighting the gran
          torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway. the
          whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in popular
          mechanics.
          walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen
          light comes on. the gran torino remains in the driveway.
          it's a challenge, an invitation. walt is daring the
          thief to come back. and walt's ready this time.
