          the old, balding barber finishes cutting walt's hair.

          barber
          there, you look like a human being
          again. you shouldn't wait so long
          between haircuts, you cheap
          bastard.

          walt
          i'm just amazed that you're still
          alive. i keep hoping you'll die
          and they'll get someone good in
          here, but you just hang in there,
          you dumb, italian-wop-dago, you.

          barber
          that'll be ten dollars, walt.

          walt
          ten dollars? jesus christ,
          martin, you keep raising the
          price. you sure you're not part
          jew?
          martin the barber laughs at walt.

          barber
          it's been ten bucks for the last
          five years and you know it, you
          thick-skulled, old pollack son of
          a bitch.

          walt
          here's ten, keep the change.

          barber
          see you in three weeks, you prick.

          walt
          if you live that long, dipshit.
          walt and martin shake hands and walt walks out.
