          walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. he deliberately
          stops at the boundary of his property.
          the reason for this is that walt's neighbors are now
          mostly asians who moved into the house that once belonged
          to polish families.
          next door to walt's house some sort of party is going on.
          walt can see through the window that the living room is
          jammed with at least forty people, all asians, all hmong.
          and this is a problem for walt, because walt is a full-
          blown, unrepentant racist.
          walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, daisy.

          walt
          jesus christ, how many swamp rats
          can they cram into a living room?
          walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.
