          int. cellar - same time

          grandsons josh, daniel and david look through boxes in
          the cellar. a box of old korea war photos are pawed
          through.

          josh holds up a black-and-white photo -- a young walt
          looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are
          sprawled dead on the ground.

          david
          is that dad?

          daniel
          no, it's grandpa walt.
          josh turns the photo over and reads it...

          josh
          Â‘third platoon, e company, march
          second, 1952, korea.'

          daniel

          josh

          david holds up a medal.

          david
          cool, i found a medal.
          they hear someone coming downstairs. by the time walt
          descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch,
          pretending to be doing nothing.
          walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.

          people eat and chat. ashley marches over to her parents,
          karen and mitch.

          ashley (granddaughter)
          how long do we have to stay, this
          ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
          and i'm bored.
          walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs,
          he overheard his granddaughter. mitch and karen are
          embarrassed.

          mitch
          ashley, honey. why don't you help
          grandpa walt with the chairs?

          ashley
          me?

          karen
          yes you.

          ashley
          grandpa walt, can i help you with
          the chairs.

          walt
          i'll take care of it, you just
          painted your nails.
          walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
          it's snowing. walt puts on his coat, he almost looks
          relieved to get out of the house.

          walt
          i'd better salt the sidewalk
          before someone falls and breaks a
          hip.
          walt taps the floor with his boot and daisy, his very,
          very, very old dog follows him outside.
