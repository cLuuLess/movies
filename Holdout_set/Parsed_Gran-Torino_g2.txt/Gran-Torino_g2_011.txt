          tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow.
          tao passes walt's garage and is startled as walt appears
          from a shadow, jumper cables in his hands. they make eye
          contact as tao passes.
          walt spits in the snow and looks down at daisy.

          walt
          i thought these zips were supposed
          to be such hard workers. christ,
          i had my own car when i was his
          age.
