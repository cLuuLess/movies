          walt and sue sit eating laab as they watch tao, who
          washes and waxes the gran torino in walt's driveway.
          sue laughs and shakes her head.

          sue
          kind of ironic, huh?

          walt
          what?

          sue
          what the hell do you think i'm
          referring to? toad washing the
          car he tried to steal from you.

          walt
          it seems like justice to me. and
          if he misses a spot, he's doing it
          all over.

          sue
          it's nice of you to kind of look
          after him like this. he doesn't
          have any real role models in his
          life.

          walt
          i ain't a role model.

          sue
          you're a good man, wally. i wish
          our dad would have been more like
          you.

          walt
          don't call me wally.

          sue
          no, i'm serious. he was hard on
          us, really traditional, really old
          school.

          walt
          i'm old school.

          sue
          yeah, but you're american.

          walt
          what's that supposed to mean?
          sue shrugs him off. they look at tao for awhile.

          sue
          you like him, don't you?

          walt
          him? don't be crazy. he tried to
          steal my car.

          sue
          and you spend time with him and
          you teach him how to fix things
          and you saved him from that fuck
          cousin of ours and...

          walt
          hey. watch the language.

          sue
          and you're a good man.

          walt
          hand me a beer, dragon lady.
          sue hands him a beer and walt pops the top.

          walt
          so tell me the problem with hmong
          boys again. i'm not completely
          clear.

          sue
          hmong girls slip in and out of the
          culture more easily. date who we
          want, stay close to our mothers,
          but are able to keep a foot on
          each side of the fence. the boys
          fall through the cracks.

          walt
          why?

          sue
          it's tough. the boys float
          around. the fathers belong in a
          totally different world and the
          boys have no one to turn to. does
          that make sense?

          walt
          not sure. no.

          sue
          the boys don't ask their fathers
          for advice, because over here,
          their fathers no longer have the
          answers.

          hmong boys become almost
          invisible, they end up banding
          together and it all goes to hell
          from there.

          walt
          the girls go to college and the
          boys go to jail.

          sue
          it's more common than not.
          walt reflects on this for awhile, then changes the
          subject.

          walt
          you still going out with that
          clown?

          sue
          no. i dumped him. he was a dim-
          wit.
          walt nods.

          walt
          good girl.
