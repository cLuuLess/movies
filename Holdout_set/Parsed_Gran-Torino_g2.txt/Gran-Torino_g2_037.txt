          walt and sue drive in silence. finally sue speaks up.

          sue
          so, what's with you, you have some
          sort of savior complex or
          something?

          walt
          what in the hell's the matter with
          you? i thought all you asian
          girls were supposed to be so
          smart. what are you doing walking
          around in that neighborhood?
          that's how you end up in the
          obituaries, that is, if they can
          identify your body once they pull
          it out of the goddamned river.

          sue
          i know, i know. take it easy.
          walt looks at her for a second. she's not ruffled at
          all.
          they drive.

          walt
          so, that goofball back there.
          he's your boyfriend?

          sue
          yeah, kind of, his name is trey.

          walt
          why in the hell would you go out
          with a clown like that. why don't
          you date one of your... own...one
          of those other... hu-mungs.

          sue
          you mean, hmong? we're hmong, not
          hu-mung.

          walt
          right. hmong. what is a... where
          is hmong or whatever?
          sue laughs.

          sue
          wow! you're so enlightened.
          hmong isn't a place, it's a
          people.

          39.

          hmong people come from different
          parts of laos and thailand and
          china.

          walt
          then why are you in my
          neighborhood, instead of back
          there?

          sue
          it's a vietnam thing. we fought
          on your side and when america
          quit, the communists starting
          killing the hmong, so we came over
          here.
          walt is quiet for few seconds.

          walt
          why'd you pick the midwest, for
          christ's sake? there's snow on
          the ground near half the year.
          jungle people on the frozen
          tundra?

          sue
          hill people. we were hill people,
          not jungle people. boo-ga, boo-
          ga, boo-ga.

          walt
          whatever.

          sue
          blame the lutherans. they brought
          us here.

          walt
          still, you'd think the cold would
          keep all the assholes away.
          sue laughs again at walt's conscienceless racism.

          sue
          thanks for the ride.

          walt
          sure... you know, you seem okay.
          what the hell's the matter with
          your half-wit brother? he a
          little slow or something?

          40.

          sue
          tao is actually really bright, he
          just doesn't know which direction
          to go in.

          walt
          oh, poor toad.

          sue
          it's really common. hmong girls
          over here fit in better, we
          adjust. the girls go to college,
          the boys go to jail.
