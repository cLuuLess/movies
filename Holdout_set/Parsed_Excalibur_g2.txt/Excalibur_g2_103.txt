               ext. forest glade -day

               water gurgles from a rock that is captive in the roots of an 
               ancient oak. lancelot, in armor, reclines against its trunk, 
               the roots cradling him. he is perfectly still, drawing life 
               from the vibrant, all-enfolding forest.

               flower petals drift on the breeze. trees sigh. fox and rabbit, 
               sparrow and hawk, at peace with each other, watch over the 
               knight.
