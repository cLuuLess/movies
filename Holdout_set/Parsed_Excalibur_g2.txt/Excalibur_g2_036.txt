               ext. farmyard - evening

               sir lot leading another group of mounted knights comes 
               galloping into a small hamlet, panicked chickens and pigs 
               scattering at their approach. the farmers run for their lives 
               as the steel men dismount, leading their horses to water and 
               hay, and searching for vittles. a knight spots a woman who 
               stands frozen with fear, and he drags her into the barn as 
               her crying child watches.
