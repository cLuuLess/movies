               int. kay's tent, arthur's war camp - night

               arthur shakes kay awake, and as the faithful knight comes 
               out of a deep sleep, he clutches arthur's arm.

                                     kay
                         merlin, will i live...?
                              (he shakes away the 
                              dream)
                         ...i was dreaming...

                                     arthur
                         of merlin?

                                     kay
                         yes. he spoke to me. he said i would 
                         fight bravely tomorrow. i have never 
                         dreamed of merlin before.

                                     arthur
                         i dreamed of him too... merlin lives! 
                         he lives in our dreams now, in that 
                         dark and shadowy place that is as 
                         strong and real as this more solid 
                         one. he speaks to us from there.
