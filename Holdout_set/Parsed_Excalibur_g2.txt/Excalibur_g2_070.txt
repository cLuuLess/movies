               ext. gorge through the hills - day

               a waterfall cascades into a pool. the spray casts a rainbow. 
               beneath it is a colorful confusion of flowers and budding 
               trees, a place dreamlike in its beauty.

               arthur, with merlin behind, gallops along the edge of the 
               pool. the trail widens into a field of grass. arthur reins 
               beside a pile of broken lances and twisted shields. across 
               the field, pitched upon the trail is a war tent made of 
               diaphanous white silk, a sky blue banner above it. merlin 
               slides off and arthur continues.

               from the tent, a knight with jousting lance rides forward to 
               meet him. his armor is so shiny it is a mirror. his eyes, 
               seen through the open visor, seem to laugh. his speech is 
               foreign, from across the sea. he is lancelot of the lake.

                                     lancelot
                         good day to you, sir.

                                     arthur
                         move aside. this is the king's road, 
                         and the knights you joined arms 
                         against were his very own.

                                     lancelot
                         i await the king himself. his knights 
                         are in need of training.

                                     arthur
                         i am king, and this is excalibur, 
                         sword of kings from the dawn of time. 
                         who are you, and why do you block 
                         the way?

                                     lancelot
                         i am sir lancelot of the lake, from 
                         across the sea. i am the best knight 
                         in the whole of christiandom, and i 
                         look for the king who is worthy of 
                         my sword's service.

                                     arthur
                         --that is a wild boast. you lack a 
                         knight's humility.

                                     lancelot
                         not a boast, sir, but a curse.
                              (a cloud passes over 
                              his innocent face)
                         never have i met my match in joust 
                         or duel.

                                     arthur
                         move aside!

                                     lancelot
                         i will not. you must retreat or prove 
                         your kingship in the test of arms, 
                         under the eyes of god.

               he crosses himself.

                                     arthur
                         then may he give me the strength to 
                         unhorse you and send you with one 
                         blow back across the sea.

               arthur wheels away, trembling with anger, and gallops to his 
               edge of the field. he sees that lancelot has already 
               positioned himself and is waiting, lance down.

               merlin watches, a spectator, as the two charge at each other. 
               they collide with great force, their spears shattering. arthur 
               is jolted but stays in the saddle. lancelot's jousting is 
               impeccable. arthur draws excalibur.

                                     lancelot
                         hold! i offer you another lance.

               pages come forward with new lances for arthur and lancelot.

                                     lancelot
                         you joust well, sir. battle learnt, 
                         but tournament fancy. you should 
                         ride more forward in the saddle, 
                         though.

               arthur grabs the spear from the page's hands, and circles 
               back to work the horse up into an all-out gallop. lancelot 
               spurs forward to meet him. arthur is neatly unhorsed. he 
               picks himself up from the ground in a rage, drawing excalibur. 
               lancelot on his horse weaves circles around him.

                                     lancelot
                         yield. i have the advantage.

                                     arthur
                         i will not.

               arthur charges lancelot, a raging bull, but cuts and slashes 
               only at the air as lancelot stays clear of him.

                                     arthur
                         fight me from your horse or on foot, 
                         but fight me. your avoidance mocks 
                         me.

                                     lancelot
                         i sought only not to harm you, sir.

               he dismounts and draws his sword, and they clash. shield and 
               sword and armor against shield and sword and armor. the 
               swordplay is furious, arthur attacking, slashing, hacking, 
               lancelot parrying effortlessly, elegantly defensive. arthur 
               breaks the onslaught to catch his breath. lancelot lifts his 
               visor. his eyes are calm, laughing.

                                     lancelot
                         sir, your rage has unbalanced you. 
                         it seems you would fight to the death 
                         against a knight who is not your 
                         enemy, for a length of road you can 
                         ride around.

                                     arthur
                         so be it, to the death.

                                     lancelot
                         it is you, sir, who knows not the 
                         virtue of humility, as a true king 
                         must.

               arthur goes forward attacking with terrible blows upon 
               lancelot's shield, and lancelot holds his ground, shield 
               high. and in its mirror-like metal arthur can see his own 
               reflection, a face distorted by uncontrolled passion.

               arthur discards his own shield, grabs excalibur with both 
               hands, and with a frightening shout that speaks of all his 
               rage, he swings a terrific blow upon the shield, cutting 
               through his own reflection and the metal. and excalibur snaps 
               in two.

               a blinding blue-green light explodes from the broken sword. 
               lancelot, knocked back by the force of the blow, is stunned 
               by the blast and falls to the ground unconscious. arthur 
               backs away, horrified, half of excalibur in his hand.

                                     arthur
                         what horror is this?
                              (calling)
                         merlin!

               merlin approaches, pale, gripped by dread.

                                     merlin
                         the sword is broken. hope is broken...

               arthur picks up the broken blade, utterly undone.

                                     arthur
                         my pride broke it, my rage broke 
                         it... humiliation and defeat lie in 
                         ambush even for a king.
                              (looking at lancelot)
                         this excellent knight who fought 
                         with fairness and grace was meant to 
                         win. with excalibur, i tried to change 
                         that verdict.

               merlin stands there, drawn, defeated, his hopes dead.

                                     arthur
                         i have lost for all time the ancient 
                         sword of my fathers whose power was 
                         meant to unite all men, to serve the 
                         vanity of a single man.

               despairing, he flings the two parts of excalibur into the 
               pool. he kneels at the waters edge, and he cries.

                                     arthur
                         i am nothing.

               then arthur sees something that startles him. beneath the 
               surface, suspended in the blue-green water amid the dancing 
               weeds, he sees excalibur, intact.

               it is held by a maiden in flowing gown the color of water, 
               her long hair rippling across her face, obscuring it.

                                     arthur
                         excalibur! is it true?

                                     merlin
                         the lady of the lake. take it. take 
                         it, quickly!

               arthur dips his hand under the water and grasps the hilt and 
               the moment he does the vision in the blue-green water fades. 
               he rises with excalibur in hand, and merlin speaks before 
               arthur can ask the question.

                                     merlin
                         there are infinite worlds within the 
                         infinite coils of the dragon. in one 
                         of them, which i have not traveled, 
                         the sword was forged. i only know 
                         that the king is returned to us 
                         through the instrument of his power. 
                         the game continues!

               and he laughs.

               just then lancelot stirs. arthur rushes to his side. he 
               loosens his helmet and removes it, uncovering damp curls. 
               the young knight's eyes open, and his laughing charm once 
               more animates his face.

                                     arthur
                         thanks to god, you are alive.

                                     lancelot
                              (sitting up)
                         i, the best knight in the world, 
                         bested! this is a great day, for my 
                         search is over. i love you, my king.

               he embraces arthur, who is overwhelmed by his childlike 
               directness. the king helps him to his feet.

                                     arthur
                         you are still the best knight in 
                         christiandom. you gained a hundred 
                         advantages over me. it is i who must 
                         love you, for through your courage 
                         and patience you taught me a bitter 
                         lesson.

                                     lancelot
                         then make me your champion and i 
                         will always fight in your place.

                                     arthur
                         but your life and lands are far from 
                         here.

                                     lancelot
                         i gave up my castles and my lands!

               he thumps his breastplate.

                                     lancelot
                         my domain is here, inside this metal 
                         skin. and i would pledge to you all 
                         that i still own: muscle, bone, blood 
                         and the heart that pumps it.

                                     arthur
                         and a great heart it is. sir lancelot, 
                         you will be my champion.

               lancelot draws his sword, holding it by the blade, a crucifix.

                                     lancelot
                         in the name of jesus christ and his 
                         holy blood, i swear eternal faith to 
                         arthur, king.

               they embrace, and merlin watches.
