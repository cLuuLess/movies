               ext. outside the castle - night

               uryens stands towering above the boy. he smiles enigmatically. 
               he lifts excalibur.

               merlin is attempting to push through the crowded ranks to 
               get to arthur.

               he's frantic and worried for once.

                                     merlin
                         i never saw this...

               uryens swiftly lowers the sword on arthur's neck; with the 
               flat of the blade he gives arthur the three strokes.

                                     uryens
                         in the name of god, of saint michael 
                         and saint george, i give you the 
                         right to bear arms, the power to 
                         mete justice.

               arthur looks up.

                                     arthur
                         that duty i will solemnly obey as 
                         knight and king.

               uryens is deeply moved.

                                     uryens
                         rise, my king. i am your humble 
                         knight, and i swear allegiance to 
                         the courage in your veins, for so 
                         strong it is, it's source must be 
                         uther. i doubt you no more.

               arthur rises and uryens kneels and kisses his hands. sir 
               ector turns away to hide brimming tears. merlin pushes through 
               finally, out of breath. uryens embraces leondegrance while 
               lot and the other enemy knights kneel in turn and kiss 
               arthur's hands.
