               ext. the sword in the stone - day

               as sir ector ascends the stone, from all parts of the jousting 
               ground knights and squires, the bishop and the clerics, and 
               peasants too, press around.

               ector lowers the blade into the tight cleft and excalibur 
               sinks to its original position.

                                     sir ector
                         draw it, son!

               sir kay grabs the hilt and pulls without conviction, and the 
               sword doesn't give. eyes downcast, he lets go.

                                     sir kay
                         sir, i didn't draw the sword. arthur 
                         gave it to me.

                                     sir ector
                         arthur ?!
                              (spinning around to 
                              face him)
                         how did you get the sword, child?

                                     arthur
                              (frightened)
                         sir... kay needed a sword. his was 
                         stolen. i saw excalibur, and... i 
                         took it.

                                     sir ector
                         you freed it, son?

                                     arthur
                         i did, father. i beg your forgiveness.

               he starts to kneel but ector pulls him up.

                                     sir ector
                         try the sword, arthur.

               arthur is about to grasp the hilt when uryens and lot, and 
               other nobles, leondegrance of camelyarde, and sir caradoc 
               and sir turquine among the younger, stride up.

                                     uryens
                         stand back, sir ector, and take your 
                         children.

                                     lot
                         we will try again.

               uryens, lot, leondegrance, caradoc, turquine - each in turn 
               grapples with the sword, only to be defeated by its 
               immobility. the crowd around the stone is thickening with 
               common folk.

                                     sir ector
                         let the boy try the sword.

                                     bishop
                         let the boy try...

               the demand is echoed by peasants and serfs. the great knights 
               remain silent and bitter in their defeat. sir ector pushes 
               arthur to the sword.

                                     sir ector
                         go ahead, boy. don't be afraid.

               the boy hesitates shyly, and then takes the hilt of excalibur 
               and pulls out the sword with a great sweep.

               the throng is stunned. silence falls. some kneel, following 
               the example of sir ector and sir kay, of the bishop and 
               leondegrance. the other nobles stay back, confused, afraid, 
               angered.

               arthur stands there, little more than a boy, his cheeks 
               flushed, his soft hair ruffled by the wind, his eyes shining 
               with exultation, awe, and fear. then, as if gaining confidence 
               from the sword itself, he turns it in arcs above his head.

                                     bishop
                         we have our king, thanks be to god.

               the commoners and some of the knights react with roaring 
               enthusiasm. the others draw closer to uryens and lot and 
               their supporters, closing ranks around them.

                                     arthur
                         please, father, rise up. i was your 
                         son before i became your king... if 
                         i am king.

               sir ector rises, tears streaming down his cheeks.

                                     sir ector
                         my lord, you are king, all the more 
                         because you are not my son, and i am 
                         not your father.

               this is quite a shock to the boy king, and to the onlookers.

                                     arthur
                         who is, then?

                                     sir ector
                         i don't know. merlin brought you to 
                         me when you were newly born and 
                         charged me to raise you as my own. 
                         at first, i did so because i feared 
                         merlin, later because i loved you.

               merlin's name is on the lips of all those close by.

                                     arthur
                         who is merlin?

                                     merlin
                         speak of the devil!...

               from out of the forest strides merlin, dramatic, cape flowing, 
               eyes crazed as ever, laughing at his own entrance. a crow is 
               perched on his shoulder, and it squawks loudly. annoyed with 
               it, merlin swooshes it away.

                                     merlin
                         i am merlin. counselor to kings. 
                         wizard and beggar. prophet and...
                              (he drops it)
                         i have feasted on thunderbolts, i 
                         savored my death before i got myself 
                         born. i--

               merlin interrupts himself when his eyes fall on the boy, who 
               is taking in his performance raptly, half awestruck, half 
               amused.

                                     arthur
                         whose son am i?

                                     merlin
                         you are the son of king uther, and 
                         the fair igrayne... you are king 
                         arthur.

               the suspicion and confusion and envy of the lords erupts.

                                     lot
                         merlin, we haven't forgotten you. 
                         this is more of your trickery.

                                     uryens
                         you're trying to foist a boy of 
                         dubious birth upon us. you want to 
                         shame us?

                                     lot
                         lord leondegrance, join us against 
                         the boy. surely you can see he is 
                         only merlin's tool.

                                     leondegrance
                         no. i, leondegrance, lord of 
                         camelyarde, saw the drawing of uther's 
                         sword, and witnessed no trickery. if 
                         a boy has been chosen, a boy shall 
                         be king.

               the crowd of serfs and peasants cheer wildly, and their long 
               suppressed anger against the nobles comes to the fore. they 
               dare to press up against them, fists hammering on their 
               shields as the chant arthur king over and over. dark and 
               scowling, full of rebellion, all the lords except leondegrance 
               begin to withdraw their iron men surrounding them.
