               int. hall of the round table - day

               the great hall is in gloom. few knights are in attendance at 
               the table.

               some sleep off last night's wine. arthur approaches, haggard, 
               searching.

                                     arthur
                         has no one seen merlin?

               knights look up; those who meet arthur's reddened eyes shake 
               their heads.

               arthur leaves. a knight whispers to another.

                                     knight
                         did you see? the king was without 
                         excalibur...
