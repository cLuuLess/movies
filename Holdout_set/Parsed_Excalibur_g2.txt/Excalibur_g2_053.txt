               ext. forest and elsewhere - day and night

                                     merlin
                         the dragon! there...

               a deep cleft at the edge of the forest, where far below lava 
               boils with a phosphorescence that lights up a great cloud, 
               billowing upward.

                                     merlin
                         coiled in the unfathomed depths, it 
                         emerges...

               merlin points to the sky where roiling clouds appear to be 
               unfurling of immeasurable wings.

                                     merlin
                         ...it unfolds itself in the storm 
                         clouds...

               a terrific wave batters a coastline, spray shooting up, and 
               as the wave recedes it exposes dark rocks and deep crevices.

                                     merlin
                         ...it washes its mane sparkling white 
                         in the blackness of seething 
                         whirlpools...

               merlin spins arthur around, and they are transported into a 
               storm swept forest. lightning strikes.

                                     merlin
                         ...its claws are the forks of 
                         lightning... its scales glisten in 
                         the bark of trees...

               the trees shine with wetness, as a great wind tosses their 
               crowns, the branches groaning against each other.

                                     merlin
                         ...its voice is heard in the 
                         hurricane...

               arthur is awestruck.
