               int. chapel, tintagel castle - night

               lightening forks across the sky, illuminating the interior. 
               the chapel has been transformed into a place of satanic 
               worship. held up and surrounded by hooded figures, morgana 
               lies on the altar, her pregnant belly huge; and her features 
               are fierce with passionate intensity. she writhes in the 
               pangs of childbirth.

                                     morgana
                         stand back, all of you. through my 
                         own body i have nurtured him with my 
                         potions. i made him. i alone can 
                         give him life.
