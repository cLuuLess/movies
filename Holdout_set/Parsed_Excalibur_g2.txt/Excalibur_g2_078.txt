               hearing lancelot storm in, the man holding the child hands 
               her to a woman and kneels before the altar, just as lancelot 
               bursts into the room, sword high and already swooping down 
               on the man's neck. lancelot brings the sword to a halt mid-
               air, his fury held in check. the repent man is spared. the 
               woman kneels to kiss lancelot's hand.
