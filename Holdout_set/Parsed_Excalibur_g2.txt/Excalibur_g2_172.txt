               ext. moors by the sea - fog - day

               it is full day, and the fog blinds with its painful glare. 
               arthur with perceval at his side rides through the fog, 
               searching. perceval takes up a challenge against the king. 
               he unhorses this opponent, piercing him with his lance. he 
               returns to the king's side.

                                     perceval
                         there are too many on mordred's side. 
                         we cannot hold out much longer.

               kay is glimpsed fighting on foot, hurt, barely holding his 
               own, but then the sight is hidden in the fog.

               kay overcomes his opponent and stops to catch his breath. he 
               is amazed by what he sees. a knight, in old, battle-scarred 
               armor whose pieces don't match, cuts down the knights in 
               black in foray after foray, wheeling and turning in a 
               brilliant and ruthless spectacle of martial arts. he fights 
               without a shield, a lance in his left hand and sword in his 
               right.

               kay moves away in search of arthur.

               arthur and perceval watch the lone knight meting out death 
               with such terrible beauty, weaving in and out of the fog.

                                     kay
                         he can be no other.

                                     arthur
                         lancelot?... it is lancelot!

               he spurs his horse forward to join him, but perceval is quick 
               to stop him.

                                     perceval
                         no, my lord. we seek mordred.

                                     kay
                         i will join him.

               kay rises onto a fresh horse and gallops away.
