               ext. fields, woods - day

               and far away, a caped figure is crossing a field toward a 
               wood, when the earth shakes, stirring animals and birds. the 
               man turns. he is merlin, the two day-old baby peeking from 
               his cape. merlin is amazed at the phenomenon, he puts his 
               ear to a rock protruding from the earth.

                                     merlin
                         into the spine of the dragon!
                              (and then he is 
                              saddened)
                         uther... i loved you, mighty child.

               and tears welling, and giggling at the same time, he whisks 
               away into the woods.
