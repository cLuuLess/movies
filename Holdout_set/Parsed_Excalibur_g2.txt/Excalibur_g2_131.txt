               ext. dead forest and stream - night

               it is very dark and perceval has to feel his way.

               he comes to the edge of a stream. he kneels to drink, and 
               the horse drinks beside him. then he rests back on his heels, 
               brooding, too tired to rise.

               he lowers his eyes, staring into the dark water, defeated, 
               empty.

               before him in the water a long thin bar of light appears. he 
               looks at it amazed. voices are heard singing very far away. 
               he reaches out to touch the long strip of light but his hand 
               just disturbs the water. it is a reflection. the strip grows 
               wider and the ethereal music is closer.

               perceval looks up. the strip of light is before him, 
               suspended, thirty feet above. it continues to grow wider. a 
               drawbridge is being slowly lowered, allowing a powerful light 
               to escape from within.

               perceval is terrified. in pain, he slowly rises into the 
               saddle, ready to gallop off; but fascinated, hypnotized by 
               the sight, he cannot, and he stays and watches.

               the dim outline of a castle becomes visible as the drawbridge 
               is lowered across the water to the ground at his feet. at 
               the center of the blast of light coming from the castle, 
               perceval can make out a burning chalice. the music swells to 
               a terrifying pitch, searing the forest.
