               ext. woods - day

               excalibur gleams in the sunlight. arthur holds it high, at 
               the head of a small force of knights under the banner of the 
               dragons. kay and perceval ride at his side. plumed helmets, 
               shields blazing with armorial colors, pennants flying in the 
               clean wind from their lances; it is a brave sight. the trees 
               are in blossom and dandelion fluff billows up at their 
               passage.
