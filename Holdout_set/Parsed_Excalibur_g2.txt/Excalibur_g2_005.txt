               int. passageway, tintagel castle - dawn

               the monk leads the party down the hallway of the castle. 
               thin shafts of dawnlight filter through archers' slits in 
               the thick walls onto stone floors. otherwise, it is dark. 
               each person, lady and knight, proceeds alone, head bent, 
               some crossing themselves.

               uther is among them. he stops in a dark alcove, breathing 
               heavily, waiting.

               as the lovely igrayne drifts past him, he pulls her out of 
               sight of the others.

               in a shaft of pale light uther clasps igrayne to his 
               breastplate, his iron arm wrapped around her frail body. so 
               violent is his embrace that she cannot breathe, her mouth is 
               wide with fear, and her feet do not touch the ground; an 
               impaled butterfly.

                                     uther
                         you will be mine. wife and queen, 
                         bed and crown.

               his face is close to hers, looking as though he would devour 
               her tender whiteness with his kiss. she doesn't answer; she 
               can't. even uther understands this and lets her go.

                                     igrayne
                              (a fierce whisper)
                         i want no other crown and no other 
                         bed than those i have.

               her gown and her fragile skin torn on the spikes of his armor, 
               igrayne backs away and joins the procession.

               uther trembles with unreleased passion.
