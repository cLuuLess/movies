               ext. forest - day

               arthur charges through the shadowy forest. he is in armor, 
               but it is only a light tunic of mail. excalibur is sheathed 
               in a leather scabbard by his side. he is frantic and he calls 
               urgently.

                                     arthur
                         ...merlin... merlin...

               his face shines with sweat, the horse is lathered. he 
               dismounts and continues on foot into denser, more tangled 
               undergrowth.

                                     arthur
                         merlin!

               a huge eye opens in the foreground of what had appeared to 
               be shadow, bark and tufts of weeds is really merlin's head.

                                     merlin
                         you called, sir?

               his voice is thin as he is awakening from a deep, exhausted 
               sleep. arthur finds him lying within the large gnarled roots 
               of a great tree. the boy kneels before merlin and lifts his 
               hands and kisses them.

                                     arthur
                         you saved me from the arrow...

                                     merlin
                              (a flicker of mischief)
                         but not from your destiny.

                                     arthur
                         i want to thank you.

                                     merlin
                         that's not why you came.

               arthur blurts it out:

                                     arthur
                         merlin, help me. i need your help. i 
                         don't know how--

                                     merlin
                              (irritated)
                         'help me, help me.' help me get up.

               arthur helps merlin up and the wizard stands unsteadily.

                                     merlin
                         i'm tired. doing magic takes its 
                         toll, you know. my arms ache 
                         terribly...
                              (he makes flying 
                              movements with his 
                              arms and grimaces)
                         once--or is it yet to happen--i stood 
                         exposed to the dragon's breath so 
                         that a man could lie one night with 
                         a woman. it took me ten moons to 
                         recover. i'm sure that story would 
                         interest you, since... well, we'll 
                         have to talk about it another time. 
                         you're too busy now.

               the forest groans and creaks, alive with murmurs and shrill 
               calls.

                                     merlin
                         it is whispered in the forest that...
                              (he cups his ear with 
                              exaggeration)
                         ...leondegrance's castle is under 
                         siege by lot and uryens.

                                     arthur
                              (pressing)
                         yes, yes, i know that. everybody 
                         does. lord leondegrance is my only 
                         ally among the barons and the great 
                         knights. i can't lose him.

                                     merlin
                         well there. you don't need me half 
                         as much as you think you do. you 
                         already know what must not happen.

                                     arthur
                              (exasperated)
                         i must find the means to save him, 
                         then. i was hoping i could ask you 
                         for a little magic help, but if it 
                         makes you so tired...

                                     merlin
                         thank you.

               silence. arthur tries again.

                                     arthur
                         it's just that i have no experience, 
                         and no men to speak of. how can i--

                                     merlin
                              (suddenly fierce)
                         because you must! you and only you. 
                         have you forgotten that it was you 
                         who freed excalibur?

               just as suddenly, he is his amused, ironic self again.

                                     merlin
                         besides, it will be a good lesson.
                              (giggling)
                         the best, if it's not the last.

               arthur bows his head, confused and almost defeated. merlin 
               steals a look at him, and puts his arm around the boy.

                                     merlin
                         maybe you'd like to meet the power 
                         that gave you the sword?

               he enjoys being cryptic.

                                     arthur
                         how? where?

                                     merlin
                         in the great book.

                                     arthur
                         what book is that?

                                     merlin
                              (melodramatic)
                         the book without pages. open before 
                         you, all around us. you can see it 
                         in bits and pieces, for if mortal 
                         men were to see it whole and all 
                         complete in a single glance, why, it 
                         would burn him to cinders.

                                     arthur
                         what?!
