               ext. jousting ground - late day

               they swing and thrust at each other with slower but bone-
               crushing force, both unsteady now. blood seeps from lancelot's 
               feet, leaving awful footprints on the earth. finally, with a 
               daring thrust, lancelot lifts gawain's visor and the sword 
               tip is before his eyes. gawain drops his sword and shield, 
               kneels and speaks in a voice hoarse with weariness.

                                     sir gawain
                         the queen is innocent. i yield to 
                         your mercy, sir lancelot.

               lancelot collapses in a dead faint.
