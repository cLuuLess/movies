               ext. stone in the forest - day

               uther has gained on his pursuers. he comes to a small clearing 
               where the spine of a buried boulder rises through the forest 
               floor. he stops upon it, breathing hard, dripping blood. he 
               rages aloud, but his throat is raw and cracked and only a 
               whisper comes out.

                                     uther
                         merlin, where are you? to weave a 
                         mist, to hide us...

               he hears his pursuers closing in.

                                     uther
                         no one shall have the sword. no one 
                         shall wield excalibur but me.

               he holds it by the hilt with both hands, the blade pointing 
               to the ground of stone. he flexes his knees. he lifts up his 
               hands above his head. and with all the strength that rage 
               and pain can muster, and more, he drives the blade of 
               excalibur into the stone, nearly to the hilt. his mouth widens 
               in an awful silent scream, and then the foam of saliva pink 
               with blood issues from deep within him, so violent was his 
               effort.

               as the sword cuts into the rock, the earth shudders.
