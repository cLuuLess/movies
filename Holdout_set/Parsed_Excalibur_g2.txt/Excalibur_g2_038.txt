               ext. site of the sword in the stone - sunrise

               red with the first light of day, excalibur rests in the stone 
               as king uther left it. the field is itched with tents, each 
               flying its heraldic banner. knights and squires are 
               everywhere, preparing horses and armor for the joust. a burly 
               man in religious robes harangues the crowd, vying for 
               attention.

                                     bishop
                         this is easter day, when christ rose 
                         again. who will find strength in 
                         victory of arms? who will draw the 
                         sword?

               the bishop goes among the tents, through the teeming throng, 
               solemnly casting holy water upon man and horse, armor and 
               banner. the knights kneel at the bishop's transit, but 
               ceremony does not lift the air of grimness that lies over 
               the event.
