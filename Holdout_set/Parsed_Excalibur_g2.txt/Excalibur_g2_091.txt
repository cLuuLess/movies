               int. hall of the round table - night

               the din of the petitioners is replaced by music. it is the 
               hour of the evening feast, and all knights are present, except 
               lancelot. whole tree trunks burn in the great fireplace, and 
               lambs roast on spits in the flames. pages run to and fro 
               with trays of food and wine, perceval among them.

               morgana stops beside merlin.

                                     morgana
                         what did i see today in the wizard's 
                         eyes? censure, because i enjoy a few 
                         words with a young handsome knight?

               merlin is in agony, a bug stuck on a pin.

                                     merlin
                         no, no, of course not. you are 
                         young...

                                     merlin
                         i'm not jealous!

                                     morgana
                         it's clear you are, and it irks me.

                                     merlin
                         no. yes, i am. i am jealous. i want 
                         to write poems about you with 
                         moonbeams, make the sea sing your 
                         name...

                                     morgana
                         a lovestruck page!

                                     merlin
                         shh... yes, yes. sit with me, 
                         please... morgana.

               she does, laughing and in complete control. his hand 
               immediately slides onto her thigh. she removes it, but holds 
               it in her hand, toying with his fingers.

                                     morgana
                         a steamy, panting, lovestruck page. 
                         but what good are songs and poems to 
                         me? they are the barter of ordinary 
                         love. a gift that reflected your 
                         greatness is the only one worthy of 
                         your love.

               merlin looks at her, knowing already, sad yet eager.

                                     merlin
                         i showed you all my conjuring 
                         tricks...

                                     morgana
                         the deepest secrets, the forbidden 
                         formulas...

                                     merlin
                         maybe... maybe...

               merlin's thoughts have carried him far away, when he realizes 
               that arthur is addressing him.

                                     arthur
                         merlin, are you counselor to the 
                         king, or to my sister?

               some knights laugh.

                                     merlin
                         at your service, sir.

                                     arthur
                         then answer me this. for years peace 
                         has reigned in the land. crops grow 
                         in abundance, there is no want. every 
                         one of my subjects enjoys his portion 
                         of happiness and justice, even those 
                         whose tiresome misunderstandings we 
                         must resolve here each day. tell me, 
                         merlin: have we defeated evil, as it 
                         seems?

                                     merlin
                         good and evil; there is never one 
                         without the other.

               arthur is taken aback.

                                     arthur
                         where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?

                                     merlin
                         never where you expect it, that's 
                         all i know.

               he chuckles softly and arthur is puzzled. a knight speaks 
               out, the young knight with whom morgana was flirting. his 
               manner is sarcastic.

                                     sir gahalt
                         if we have peace and justice, why is 
                         lancelot never with us? why is he 
                         always riding out on his quests? he 
                         must know where this evil is.

                                     sir gawain
                         could there be evil within lancelot 
                         himself? to live above human folly, 
                         as is his aim, is to be overly proud.

                                     sir gahalt
                         he pays no heed even to the queens 
                         longing for his company.

               the hall falls silent, all eyes upon the queen.

                                     guenevere
                              (lashing out)
                         what is it you would have your words 
                         mean, sir gahalt?

               frightened, gahalt doesn't answer. morgana has slipped to 
               guenevere's side.

                                     morgana
                         don't listen to him. you are the 
                         queen.

               arthur, ashen-faced, turns to merlin for help, but he has 
               escaped into sleep...

                                     arthur
                         sir gahalt, answer the queen.

                                     guenevere
                         no. i meant not to be angry with 
                         you, sir gahalt. in the idleness 
                         that comes with peace gossip has 
                         bread its own evil. you merely repeat 
                         it. please, sir, have one of those 
                         apples that lancelot loves, and in 
                         that gesture partake of its goodness.

               morgana picks the bowl up and as she does so, unseen by any 
               and with a magician's dexterity, she thrusts her fingernails 
               deep into the top apple. she gives the bowl to guenevere, 
               who takes it and sweeps around to where sir gahalt sits, 
               followed by morgana. the young knight jumps to his feet.

                                     guenevere
                         take one, sir gahalt.

                                     sir gahalt
                         i am most honored, my lady.

               he is too shy to take the shiniest, most beautiful apple on 
               top, and goes for another one. morgana giggles, and he looks 
               at her. she looks at the apple on top and then smiles 
               encouragingly at him. sir gahalt takes it and starts eating 
               as the queen returns to her seat.

               with the third bite his is unable to breathe. his face goes 
               red and he rises to his feet, attempting to call out.

               he falls, dying immediately. all leap to their feet, and 
               arthur rushes to the young knight. merlin is asleep and far 
               from human affairs.

               arthur and sir gawain rise from the body of the young knight. 
               sir gawain backs away from arthur and points at guenevere, 
               trembling with cold rage.

                                     sir gawain
                         hear me, lord arthur, and knights 
                         and chieftains: i charge guenevere 
                         with the murder of my brother.

               guenevere, white and with a broken voice, turns to arthur.

                                     guenevere
                         i didn't... i am innocent.

               she begins to swoon and morgana keeps her steady on her feet. 
               arthur slumps into his seat and sir gawain kneels before 
               him.

                                     sir gawain
                         i champion this truth: that queen 
                         guenevere murdered sir gahalt with 
                         the aid of sorcery.

               enraged, arthur reaches for excalibur. but with effort he 
               checks his impulse.

                                     arthur
                         the queen will be in my charge till 
                         a champion steps forward to fight on 
                         her behalf.

                                     guenevere
                         not you, my husband?

               arthur cannot look at her.

                                     sir gawain
                         she must be burnt at the stake. that 
                         is the sentence for murder done with 
                         magic.

                                     arthur
                         it is. lords and knights of the round 
                         table, as her husband i say that 
                         this deed was not done by guenevere. 
                         who among you will champion this 
                         truth?

               no one responds. guenevere falls into her seat. arthur 
               searches the eyes of his knights and they evade him.

                                     arthur
                         sir caradoc! you!

               the knight looks up.

                                     caradoc
                         i am torn.

               sir ector, old and feeble, weeps for arthur. someone speaks 
               up. it is perceval, who kneels before the queen. his voice 
               is unnaturally loud, and his eyes shine with held-back tears; 
               he stutters.

                                     perceval
                         i will champion you, my lady.

               he is overwhelmed by his own boldness. he looks around. all 
               eyes are upon him. guenevere smiles at him, sadly.

                                     guenevere
                         i thank you, but you are not yet a 
                         knight.

                                     perceval
                         i will find lancelot! he will come!

               perceval hurries from the hall. arthur looks away, ashamed, 
               and his eyes fall on merlin, twitching and mumbling in his 
               sleep.

                                     merlin
                         boys!... boys will be boys...
