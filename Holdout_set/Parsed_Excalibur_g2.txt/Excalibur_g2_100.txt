               int. cell, camelot - evening

               eyes closed, lancelot lies on a bed, naked but for a cloth 
               across his loins. his minor wounds have been dressed, and 
               merlin is kneading the huge gash in his stomach, working the 
               severed flesh together. guenevere stands on one side of the 
               bed, arthur on the other, both looking down upon lancelot, 
               relieved and not daring to look at each other.

                                     merlin
                         flesh on flesh. you must press on 
                         the wound, guenevere, hold it, and 
                         it will begin to bind.

               guenevere kneels, and at her touch lancelot's eyes flicker 
               open. merlin exits, and draws arthur away with him.

               arthur is deeply tormented.

                                     arthur
                         merlin, tell me. now that guenevere 
                         is returned to me...

                                     merlin
                         what is it my child?

               merlin appears moved by the predicaments that arthur has to 
               face.

                                     arthur
                         will i have a son?

               merlin stares off into the evening sky, where a lark sings 
               high up.

                                     merlin
                         yes.

                                     arthur
                         just yes? no mad laughter, no riddles, 
                         nothing but a simple yes? that 
                         frightens me.

                                     merlin
                         a king should be afraid, always. the 
                         enemy is everywhere. waiting in ambush 
                         in the dark corridors of his castle, 
                         on the deer paths of his forest, or 
                         in the gray and winding paths of a 
                         more tangled forest, in here.

               he taps his skull and smiles.
