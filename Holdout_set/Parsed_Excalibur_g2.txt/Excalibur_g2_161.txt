               ext. mordred's war camp - night

               cape flowing, merlin sweeps between mordred's war tents, and 
               in the logic of dreams, unseen by the guards. he passes a 
               tent where the huge shadow of mordred is thrown on the canvas, 
               as he sharpens the blade of a fearsome spear.

               he enters a tent.
