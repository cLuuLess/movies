               ext. war camp - before tintagel castle - day

               uther is in a towering rage. sword drawn, he stalks among 
               the biers of fallen knights. squires and clerics keep a 
               healthy distance. the sky is lowering, pregnant with rolling 
               thunder. beyond his encampment, high on a cliff rising out 
               of the sea stands the impregnable tintagel castle, seat of 
               the duke of cornwall, now under siege.

                                     uther
                              (bellowing in all 
                              directions)
                         merlin! where are you!?

               just then a knight rides up and dismounts. it is ulfius, a 
               lieutenant.

                                     uther
                         have you found him?

                                     ulfius
                         no--

               but he cannot finish. he is taken aback by the sudden 
               appearance of a hideous hag who approaches, rattling a 
               beggar's pan.

                                     hag
                         what a hurry you were in this morning, 
                         good sir. you forgot to give this 
                         old woman a coin.

                                     ulfius
                         i saw you half a day's gallop from 
                         here. i asked you if you had seen 
                         merlin. i returned here straight 
                         away. how did -

                                     hag
                         --i heard. i have come. i am also 
                         merlin.

               the figure straightens, the filthy rags become a flowing 
               cape, and the hair is swept back by the wind, and√≥it is 
               merlin, laughing.

                                     merlin
                         i have walked my way since the 
                         beginning of time. sometimes i give, 
                         sometimes i take. it is mine to know 
                         which, and when.

                                     uther
                              (exploding)
                         dumb riddles, merlin. i am your king.

               ulfius edges away.

                                     merlin
                         i know the storm inside you, and 
                         what it has wrought. the alliance i 
                         forged is wrecked.

               the duke of cornwall under siege. all this for lust. selfish 
               lust.

               uther grabs merlin.

                                     uther
                         for igrayne. one night with her. do 
                         it. use the magic.

               merlin frowns pensively, his gaze searching strange distances 
               and wandering; then focusing, blazing straight at uther.

                                     merlin
                         you will swear by your true kingship 
                         to grant me what i wish. then you 
                         shall have it.

               uther kneels and draws his sword and holds it up by the blade, 
               a cross.

                                     uther
                         i swear it. by excalibur and the 
                         holy--

                                     merlin
                         --what issues from your lust will be 
                         mine. swear it again.

                                     uther
                         i swear it.

               merlin looks down sorrowfully at the kneeling king.
