               ext. forest glade - day

               lancelot gets to his feet, tense. guenevere dismounts and 
               approaches. she is flushed and breathless from the wild race. 
               her horse, left free, wanders over to his and grazes beside 
               it.

                                     lancelot
                         why? you will destroy arthur, and 
                         us...

               she moves closer and he thrusts out his mailed fist to keep 
               her away. she clutches it and presses the metal to her soft 
               tear-streaked cheek.

                                     lancelot
                         the law forbids it.

                                     guenevere
                         love demands it.

               hungry with passion, she embraces the cold unmoving armor, 
               kissing it.

                                     lancelot
                         there are things about love--

                                     guenevere
                         --nothing!

               he steps back, drawing his sword. he holds it up by the blade 
               between them.

                                     lancelot
                         by my knight's sword, i swore faith--

               and before he can finish she grabs the blade to push it aside. 
               he holds it fast. blood streams from her bare hands. he cannot 
               prevail without cutting them deeply. he lets go of the sword, 
               and she lets it fall to the ground.

               she embraces his still and defeated hulk. she kisses the 
               metal, and sensation shoots through him, dizzying him.

                                     lancelot
                         guenevere...

               he folds her in his arm, and their bodies lock together as 
               though a trap had sprung. their mouths meet, each devouring 
               the other...
