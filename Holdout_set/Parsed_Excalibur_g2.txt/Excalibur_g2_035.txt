               ext. fields - day

               peasants spill over the crest of a hill. they are fleeing a 
               force of armored knights, their plumed helmets forged in the 
               semblance of predatory animals. the knights thunder past the 
               peasants, trampling the ripening crops. sir uryens is their 
               leader, his hard face indifferent to the havoc he leaves in 
               his wake.

               the peasants watch in mute anger.
