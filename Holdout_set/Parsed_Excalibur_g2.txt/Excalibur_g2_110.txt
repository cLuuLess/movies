               ext. forest glade - night

               all passion spent, locked in each other's arms, lancelot and 
               guenevere drift off into sleep.

               arthur comes upon them. he stands over them. he draws 
               excalibur. checking all emotion, he holds it above his head. 
               the ancient steel glows darkly.

               the lovers faces are serene and innocently beautiful. he 
               hesitates, tormented. his mask of anguish gives way to 
               determination and calm. he strikes the sword home, letting 
               go of it.

               he backs away, turns and disappears into the forest.
