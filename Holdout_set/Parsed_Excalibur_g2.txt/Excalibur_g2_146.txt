               int. hall of the round table - night

               perceval falls to his knees before arthur and he holds the 
               chalice, now whole again, up to the king. it fills with blood 
               from within and arthur takes it from perceval. he drinks. 
               and having done so, he seems to become younger and to grow 
               in strength.

                                     arthur
                         i didn't know how empty was my soul 
                         until it was filled.

               sir kay stands by the vast fireplace where a small fire burns, 
               and only now looks up and is aware of perceval.

                                     kay
                         perceval, you have returned!

                                     arthur
                         ready my knights for battle; they 
                         will ride with their king once more. 
                         i have lived through others far too 
                         long! lancelot carried my honor and 
                         guenevere my guilt. my knights have 
                         fought my causes. mordred carries my 
                         sins. now, at last, i will rule.
