               int. hall of the round table, camelot - day

               dead knights lay on biers. the once glorious seat of power 
               is falling into decay. few are in attendance around the table. 
               agitated, kay enters and goes to arthur, who is worn and 
               haggard, and aged.

                                     kay
                         your son mordred is at the gate.

               arthur comes alive.

                                     arthur
                         at last...

                                     kay
                         don't recognize him. you were trapped 
                         by morgana's sorcery.

                                     arthur
                              (staring off)
                         ...gawain and perceval, bors and 
                         bohort, caradoc and ector, and all 
                         the others--lost to me. only the 
                         echo of their voices remains in this 
                         empty hall. all i have left is the 
                         memory of their fellowship. echoes 
                         and memories. i am a ghost of the 
                         king that once was...
                              (he turns to kay and 
                              with sudden harshness)
                         ...mordred is real, alive, my own 
                         flesh and blood. i will see him, i 
                         must.
