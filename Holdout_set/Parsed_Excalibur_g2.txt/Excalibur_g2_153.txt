               ext. pit, moors - day

               arthur's group comes to a halt. two knights and a few squires 
               galloping from the opposite direction rein in before the 
               king. the knights draw their swords in homage, and the older 
               one addresses arthur.

                                     knight
                         it is only me and my son. all other 
                         knights of the dukedom have rallied 
                         to mordred.

               arthur smiles hiding the hurt. he points to an open pit, a 
               huge devastation.

                                     arthur
                         what horror is that?

                                     knight
                         mordred, sir. he digs for precious 
                         metals, with which he buys the loyalty 
                         of men at arms, binding them to his 
                         side.
