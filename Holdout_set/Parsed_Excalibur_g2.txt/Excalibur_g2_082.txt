               ext. chapel, site of the sword in the stone - day

               arthur and guenevere are ushered in by kay. they are flanked 
               by leondegrance and sir ector. lancelot and merlin follow, 
               leading the cortege of knights and ladies.

               merlin is incapable of entering the chapel, as if at the 
               threshold there is an unseen force that repels him.

                                     lancelot
                         lord merlin, are you ill?

                                     merlin
                         no, no, i need air.

               strangling a laugh he wrenches himself away. just then uryens 
               and a small party of knights rides up through the tents and 
               dismounts in front of the church. uryens helps a lady off 
               her horse and joins the cortege on foot.

                                     uryens
                         merlin, don't you join the 
                         celebration?

               merlin, who was slinking away through the throng of 
               bystanders, looks up. what he sees sends a chill through his 
               body.

               at uryens' side stands a young woman of sinister beauty, 
               with bewitching eyes of ice. merlin just stares at her, and 
               she smiles back at him faintly.

                                     uryens
                         my wife, merlin. lady morgana of 
                         cornwall.

                                     morgana
                         i remember you, merlin. i was a child. 
                         you took my brother away.

               merlin laughs. uryens shrugs and continues into the chapel 
               with morgana. as she enters she glances back, and just then 
               merlin steals a look, their eyes meet.
