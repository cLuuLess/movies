               ext. jousting ground - day

               at the edge of the jousting ground sir ector's son sir kay 
               is getting ready for a bout. his brother arthur is buckling 
               the new armor while his father fusses about him, making small 
               adjustments when he notices that kay's scabbard is empty. he 
               turns to arthur and grab's him by the ear.

                                     sir ector
                         arthur, where is kay's sword? a good 
                         squire doesn't forget his knight's 
                         sword.

               the fifteen year-old boy blushes.

                                     arthur
                         i left it in the tent, sir.

                                     sir ector
                         well hurry then, and get it.

               the boy dashes off as sir ector shakes his head, not without 
               affection beneath the sternness.
