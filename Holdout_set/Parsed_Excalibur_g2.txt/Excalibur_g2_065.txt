               ext. wood by camelyarde castle - day

               the castle can be glimpsed through the trees. a clear spring 
               bubbles from the ground, and the sun splashes leaf, bird, 
               squirrel, and bee with golden light, and arthur and guenevere 
               too. guenevere is serious and intent on her work.

                                     arthur
                         owww...

               with water from the spring, she is bathing a large cut on 
               his chest that has been stitched closed. wounds on his arms, 
               and one on a calf also show evidence of her neat sewing. 
               she's just finishing, and she dabs his chest with a dry cloth.

                                     guenevere
                         it didn't hurt too much, did it?

                                     arthur
                         ye...

                                     guenevere
                         --i'm pretty good at stitchery. i've 
                         sewn my father's wounds more than 
                         once.

               he starts to get up.

                                     guenevere
                         careful! you'll have to stay still 
                         for a few days or you'll tear them 
                         open.

               arthur shivers at the thought.

                                     arthur
                         but i have to leave tomorrow. the 
                         forests are thick with rebels, 
                         invaders plunder our shores...

                                     guenevere
                         --and damsels in besieged castles 
                         are waiting to be rescued?

                                     arthur
                         i didn't know leondegrance had a 
                         daughter.

                                     guenevere
                         well, then, i shall tell you which 
                         knights have maiden daughters, so 
                         you can avoid their castles.

               arthur smiles at her, enjoying her jealousy, and it irritates 
               her a little.

                                     guenevere
                         no, i think it's better if you just 
                         stay here to heal. at least a week.

                                     arthur
                         i'm going.

                                     guenevere
                         quiet, or i'll sew up your mouth 
                         too.

               she touches his lips with hers, her eyelids fluttering shut. 
               he stares at her young beauty, and draws her into a long, 
               slow kiss.

               a shrill almost human squeal pierces the air not far away. 
               arthur pulls away startled, half-rising. guenevere giggles.

                                     guenevere
                         would you rescue me from a fiery 
                         dragon, sir?

               she puts her arms around him, drawing him close again, 
               speaking in a half-whisper.

                                     guenevere
                         it's just a furry little rabbit that 
                         took the bait and sprung the trap.

               they smile at each other, about to kiss. as they come closer:

                                     guenevere
                         you'll find him served up to you 
                         tonight, cooked in a most excellent 
                         sauce...
