               int. castle, various

               heading for the source of the light he ascends what seem to 
               be a staircase. he enters a hall where the chalice stands 
               suspended, burning with light, and the mysterious music swirls 
               and grows.

               perceval approaches the diaphanous and featureless figure 
               who stands over the chalice.

                                     figure
                         who does it serve?

                                     perceval
                         you, my lord.

                                     figure
                         i have waited long for you. once you 
                         almost saw, but fear blinded you. 
                         why am i served from the chalice?

                                     perceval
                         because you and the land are one.

                                     figure
                         i am wasting away and i cannot die. 
                         and i cannot live.

                                     perceval
                         you and the land are one. drink from 
                         the chalice. you will be reborn and 
                         the land with you.

               perceval cups his hands around the chalice to lift it. but 
               they close on nothing, and he draws back. the figure's hands, 
               although insubstantial, grasp perceval's and appear to hold 
               his hands around the cup.

                                     figure
                         but who am i?

               perceval begins to kneel.

                                     perceval
                         you are my lord and king. you are 
                         arthur.

               the blinding light vanishes, the music drifts away.
