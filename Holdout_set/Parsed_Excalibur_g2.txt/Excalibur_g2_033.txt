               ext. stone in the forest - day

               uther staggers away, colliding with trees, staggering, 
               crashing to the ground. until the only life left in him is 
               the coursing of his blood, flowing from his gaping mouth 
               onto the leaves on the forest floor.

               the enemy knights advance through the trees. they prod at 
               the fallen leviathan, they roll him over to get at his 
               scabbard. only then do they see the sword in the stone, and 
               they stop, amazed and afraid. their captains appear. uryens 
               sees what they are staring at, and races to the sword and 
               attempts to pull it out.

               he strains with all his might, but it is immovable.

                                     lot
                         let me.

               he shoves uryens aside, but he can't loosen the sword either, 
               and he rages with frustration.

                                                                  fade out:

               legend appears:

               "fifteen years passed and the land was without a king."
