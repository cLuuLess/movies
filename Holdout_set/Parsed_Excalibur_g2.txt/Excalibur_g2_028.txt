               int. hall, tintagel castle - night.

               merlin comes across the empty banquet hall, cooing to the 
               baby, strangely pacifying him. morgana steps out of the 
               shadows in his path, and merlin stops at the sight of the 
               little girl, her pale eyes glaring at him.

               she speaks haltingly and clearly while far-off igrayne cries 
               out her distress.

                                     morgana
                         merlin, are you now the father, and 
                         the mother, of the baby?

               staring at her, merlin shudders and without answering he 
               continues away, faster now, and into an unlit passageway, 
               disappearing from sight a bit sooner than an ordinary mortal 
               would have.
