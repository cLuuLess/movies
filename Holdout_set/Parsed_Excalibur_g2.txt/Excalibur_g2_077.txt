               lancelot, immobile. behind him, the knight, his face shiny 
               with sweat. his minions inch forward, hands moving slowly 
               toward sword hilts.

               lancelot wheels his horse around.

                                     lancelot
                         i hear the stifled cry for help, i 
                         smell the reek of fear...

               with a shout the knight and his men draw their swords and 
               rush lancelot. he reins in his horse, causing it to rear and 
               break their attack. he slides off, falling on his feet with 
               sword drawn, already fighting. in an extraordinary show of 
               sword play he cuts down six men.
