               int. chapel - day

               uryens and morgana take their places near the altar. arthur 
               and guenevere kneel before the bishop, and arthur takes her 
               hand. the clatter of armor mingles with the enthusiastic, 
               happy singing of the children, and seems to strengthen their 
               song.
