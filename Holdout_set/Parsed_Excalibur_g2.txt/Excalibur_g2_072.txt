               int. farmhouse - day

               terrified women, a screaming child, cowering men, old or 
               made old by the hard labor of the fields. armored men are 
               ransacking a farm, looking for grain, and gold which they 
               find among the votive objects of a little house altar. a 
               woman is dragged away to be raped.

               through a window, a knight in shining armor is seen emerging 
               from the adjoining woods. the plunderers are all of a sudden 
               apprehensive, and fall silent. one of them grabs the crying 
               child and covers her mouth with his iron hand.
