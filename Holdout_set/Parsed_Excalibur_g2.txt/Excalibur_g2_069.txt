               his countenance grim, arthur gallops along a trail bordering 
               a plowed field when in it a scarecrow moves. it starts to 
               run as stick-wielding farmers pursue it. it is merlin. arthur 
               turns off into the field, and at the sight of an armored 
               knight on a war horse, the farmers turn and flee. merlin 
               stops to catch his breath.

                                     arthur
                              (angry)
                         i should have left you to fend for 
                         yourself.

                                     merlin
                         i had to weave a little enchantment 
                         on the bees so i could get some honey, 
                         and i didn't feel up to using any 
                         more magic just yet. anyway, i was 
                         in less danger than you'll be in 
                         today.

               arthur's hand is clenched tight around excalibur's hilt.

                                     arthur
                         so you were stealing their honey. 
                         they should have killed you.

                                     merlin
                         come now. so much anger for such a 
                         little crime? are you sure there is 
                         nothing else troubling you?

                                     arthur
                         you know full well there is, and i 
                         go to meet it now. come witness my 
                         revenge.

               he offers his arm and merlin hoists himself up behind the 
               king.
