               int. cell - dawn

               candles flicker on a small altar before which a nun is 
               praying. she turns to see who has entered. it is guenevere, 
               older, thin with self-denial, all the more beautiful. she 
               looks up at the majestic figure who stands before her. she 
               nearly swoons. he helps her to her feet, and words rush from 
               deep within him.

                                     arthur
                         guenevere, accept my forgiveness, 
                         and put your heart to rest. we have 
                         suffered to long. i have always loved 
                         you, and i still love you.

               she weeps.

                                     guenevere
                         i loved you much, as king, and 
                         sometimes as husband, but one cannot 
                         gaze too long at the sun in the sky.

                                     arthur
                         forgive me, my wife, if you can. i 
                         was not born to live a man's life, 
                         but to be the stuff of future memory. 
                         the fellowship was a brief beginning, 
                         a fair time that cannot be forgotten; 
                         and because it will not be forgotten, 
                         that fair time may come again. now 
                         once more i must ride with my knights 
                         to defend what was, and the dream of 
                         what could be.

                                     guenevere
                         i have kept it.

               she draws back the covers of her pallet, and there is 
               excalibur. arthur is overwhelmed by emotion; he can barely 
               speak

                                     arthur
                         i never dared to hope all these years 
                         that it was in your keeping.

               he kneels before her and kisses her thigh. she gazes off, 
               remembering the life of long ago. he rises and looks off 
               into her eyes, unable to find the words; he finally does.

                                     arthur
                         i have often thought that in the 
                         hereafter of our lives, when i owe 
                         no more to the future and can be 
                         just a man, that we may meet, and 
                         you will come to me and claim me as 
                         yours, and know that i am your 
                         husband. it is a dream i have...

               he takes excalibur by the hilt and exits.
