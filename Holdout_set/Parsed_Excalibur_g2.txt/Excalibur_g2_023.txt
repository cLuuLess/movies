               merlin has been propped up against one of the stones. he is 
               in a deep trance and uther is attempting to shake him awake.

                         i want her, merlin. i cannot be 
                         without her. tintagel is mine. can i 
                         take her now? tell me!

               merlin's eyes open but he sees nothing, and only a puzzling 
               squeal issues from him.
