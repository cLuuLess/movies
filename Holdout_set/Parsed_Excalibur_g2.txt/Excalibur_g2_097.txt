               ext. jousting ground outside camelot - dawn

               the bishop blesses the field. guenevere, numb and 
               disbelieving, is being led to the stake, which rises from a 
               bed of straw and wood. arthur watches, in shock. other knights 
               and ladies keep their distance, watching darkly, stealing 
               glances at arthur, mumbling disapproval of his refusing to 
               defend guenevere. in battle dress, sir gawain rides up and 
               down the jousting run on a snorting and powerful horse, 
               practicing. perceval, in a mail doublet, waits beside a mangy 
               roan, his face burning with anxiety.

               guenevere is tied to the stake. all eyes watch for the 
               approach of her champion. arthur goes to perceval.

                                     arthur
                         is he coming?

                                     perceval
                         he heard lady guenevere's request 
                         and he said nothing. that is all.

               arthur hides his pain behind a rigid mask.
