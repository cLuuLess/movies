               ext. moors by the sea - evening

               perceval dismounts, rushing to kneel at the king's side. 
               arthur looks up, calm and intense.

                                     arthur
                         when you threw it in, what did you 
                         see?

                                     perceval
                         ...i saw nothing.

               the king looks at him with piercing power. perceval blurts 
               it out.

                                     perceval
                         my king, i couldn't do it. excalibur 
                         cannot be lost. other men--

                                     arthur
                         --by itself it is only a piece of 
                         steel. its power comes from he who 
                         wields it. for now there is no one. 
                         do as i have ordered!

               perceval leaves once more. the daylight is failing, the sun 
               is near the horizon over the sea, bursting through clouds.
