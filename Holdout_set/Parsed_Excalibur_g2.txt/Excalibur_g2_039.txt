               ext. jousting ground, sword in the stone - day

               their armor ablaze with sunlight, two mounted knights thunder 
               toward each other at full gallop, lowering their long jousting 
               lances. as they meet, the lance of each knight is deflected 
               by the shield of the other. a gasp goes through the crowd, 
               and the two knights charge past each other. they wheel around 
               at the end of the jousting ground and go at each other again 
               from the other direction. again lances strike, and this time 
               one of the men is hit in the chest and violently unhorsed. 
               the crowd cheers.
