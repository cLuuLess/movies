               ext. battlements, camelot - dusk

               arthur and merlin, the king desperate, the wizard overwhelmed 
               by compassion:

                                     arthur
                         i am alone and betrayed. by my wife, 
                         by my beloved friend, by my knights. 
                         and by you. perhaps most of all by 
                         you. for you made me, you forged 
                         this wretched life. and like a child 
                         tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a 
                         babbling lecher trotting after my 
                         sister...

                                     merlin
                         that is my destiny. i have a destiny, 
                         too...

                                     arthur
                         with all your powers, you are content 
                         to be ridiculed, laughed at...

                                     merlin
                         my powers fade, arthur. i resort to 
                         cheap tricks...
                              (with sudden enthusiasm)
                         yes! i enjoy every moment of my 
                         foolishness, i join in the making of 
                         it, so no one can betray me. but 
                         you! you betray yourself.

                                     arthur
                         me? i have lived by the oath of king 
                         and knight.

                                     merlin
                         you betray the boy who drew the sword, 
                         the boy who saw the dragon... the 
                         dragon who moves close by, coiling 
                         and uncoiling, restless, looking 
                         down, waiting for the king to be a 
                         king...

               arthur looks up and in the rolling clouds maybe, just maybe, 
               the form of a dragon is taking shape. arthur draws excalibur, 
               intensity animating his dead features.

                                     arthur
                         i must do it myself. i must kill 
                         them both. lancelot and guenevere. 
                         will you ride with me, merlin?

                                     merlin
                         i cannot. i must not. here i must 
                         stay.

               they embrace. merlin is on the verge of tears, his face 
               immediately sad and finally ancient. arthur exits.

               morgana, who has been watching from the shadows, watching 
               from the shadows, slinks up to merlin's side.

                                     morgana
                         crazy old fool. you think yourself a 
                         kingmaker. ha! a meddler, more likely. 
                         look what a mess you've made of 
                         things.

               merlin smiles knowingly at her.

                                     merlin
                         i? perhaps, perhaps. i'm losing 
                         interest, morgana... i have helped 
                         men--or meddled in their affairs, if 
                         you would have it that way--since 
                         the dawn of time. now let them live 
                         by their own laws. let them stand on 
                         their own feet. the gods of once are 
                         gone forever, it is time for men... 
                         morgana, make a man out of me. kiss 
                         me.

               he reaches to touch her lips. she cradles his hand in hers 
               and doesn't allow merlin to kiss her. she kisses his knuckles 
               and stares into his eyes, stoking his desire.

                                     morgana
                         you know what i want. i want the 
                         secret of true magic, how to thicken 
                         the stuff of dreams and wishes with 
                         the flesh of the world.

                                     merlin
                         that i cannot.

               she breaks away, provocative, alluring.

                                     morgana
                         then i will not.
