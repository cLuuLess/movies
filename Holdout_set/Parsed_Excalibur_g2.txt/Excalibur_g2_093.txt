               int. bedchamber, camelot - night

               arthur stands hunched over the fireplace, staring into the 
               flames. guenevere paces back and forth to a window.

                                     guenevere
                         why can't you be my champion?

                                     arthur
                         if i am your judge, i cannot be your 
                         champion. when i act as your king, i 
                         cannot be your husband.

                                     guenevere
                         and you cannot love me...

                                     arthur
                         the laws, my laws, must bind everyone, 
                         high and low, or they are not laws 
                         at all. lancelot will come...

                                     guenevere
                         and if he cannot be found, no other 
                         knight will champion me, though you 
                         beseeched each and every one of them. 
                         why be king if there is no one you 
                         can call loyal subject but an eager 
                         boy?

               he hides his anguish from her. numb with hurt, she goes to a 
               tall curtained window, and draws it open, and stands there 
               looking out upon the surrounding forest, silent and still 
               beneath the moon.
