               ext. farm - evening

               he leaps from the saddle and a terrified woman backs away. 
               perceval plunges his hand into the source of light. it is 
               nothing but the reflection of the dying sun in a bucketful 
               of water. perceval covers his face.

                                     perceval
                         illusions. i will never find it 
                         again... i am sorry, woman, that i 
                         frightened you.

               peasants have emerged, surrounding him, and they hold axes 
               and pitchforks.

                                     perceval
                         good woman, do you have any food? 
                         some water?...

                                     peasant
                         the little we had, we gave to 
                         mordred's knights. he has taken this 
                         land. tell the king that now we must 
                         look to mordred.

                                     second peasant
                         but we will give you some water...

               at least ten peasants encircle perceval and he is too 
               exhausted to put up a fight. they grab him and carry him 
               away. other peasants pull his horse to the ground, and one 
               raises and ax to kill it.
