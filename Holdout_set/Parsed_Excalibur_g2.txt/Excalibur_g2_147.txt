               ext. woods and fields - night

               arthur at the head of a small force of knights, their armor 
               shining beneath the moon, gallops through the land. where 
               hooves thunder, the ground becomes alive with sprouts and 
               tendrils, and bare trees start to bud, and grasses to blossom, 
               the power of nature exploding into life.
