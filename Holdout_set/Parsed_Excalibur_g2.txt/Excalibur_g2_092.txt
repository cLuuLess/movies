               ext. hovel - countryside - day

               in full armor but for his helmet, lancelot is seated at a 
               small table in the shadow of a tree, eating an apple.

               a young girl is turning a chicken on a spit, and her mother 
               is removing freshly-baked bread from an oven. it is very 
               peaceful and silent until, galloping all out, perceval 
               arrives. frantic, out of breath, he leaps from his lathered 
               horse.

                                     perceval
                         i have found you. the queen. an apple.
                         tomorrow. sir gawain...

                                     lancelot
                         --it must wait, child. these good 
                         ladies, for whom i intervened once, 
                         will honor me with a meal. i am 
                         beholden to them now as i was when 
                         they begged my protection.

               the two women set the chicken and the bread before the great 
               knight, and stand back to watch him eat, flushed with 
               excitement. perceval falls silent, in awe of lancelot.
