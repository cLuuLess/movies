               ext. forest - day

               the forest is dark and shiny with rain. an unseen battle 
               rages.

               the first combatant in sight is uther, who swings the mighty 
               excalibur, cutting an attacker in half at the waist. uther 
               and a small force of knights, ulfius among them, are 
               retreating through the slippery wet forest, completely 
               outnumbered.

               lord lot of lowthean and lord uryens of gore are the leaders 
               of the attack.

                                     uryens
                              (to his men)
                         the king's sword. i must have it.

               ulfius and his men stand their ground so the king may escape 
               the onslaught. they are hacked down.

               uther flees alone, severing the limbs of any man and tree 
               that stands in his way.
