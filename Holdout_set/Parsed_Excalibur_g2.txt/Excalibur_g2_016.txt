               ext. uther's war camp - night

               the real duke and his men ride through the fogbound camp, 
               cutting the ropes of the tents, stabbing the men trapped 
               beneath the canvas. when a frightened crow flies squawking 
               into the face of the duke's horse, which rears. he is unhorsed 
               and falls, and impales himself on a tent stake.

               dying, the true lord of tintagel castle rises and staggers 
               forward, blood pumping from him.
