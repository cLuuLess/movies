               int. dungeons of camelot

               merlin and morgana descend winding steps cut out of rock. 
               the only light comes from the glow of merlin's staff.

                                     merlin
                         when arthur built the castle, i carved 
                         out a place for myself, where i could 
                         laugh or sleep, and no one would 
                         bother me.

                                     morgana
                         people make you laugh?

               he laughs.

                                     merlin
                         they do.

                                     morgana
                         why?

               he leans close to her ear, whispering into it.

                                     merlin
                         they don't know how close they live 
                         to the edge of delight or disas...

               he is about to kiss her when he slips. he laughs.

                                     merlin
                         happiness or horror.
