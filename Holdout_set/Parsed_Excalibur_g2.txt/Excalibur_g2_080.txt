               int. pavilion - day

               guenevere is surrounded by a group of ladies and maids who 
               fuss over her dress and her hair. they eye the great knight 
               and whisper about him, guenevere laughing with them.

               arthur sits, excited and happy.

                                     arthur
                         sit beside me, lancelot.

               lancelot sits, stiff and upright.

                                     arthur
                         your deeds set an example for all 
                         other knights. for your gift, ask a 
                         gift of me.

                                     lancelot
                         only give me leave to ride out again, 
                         to do what i am most able to do, and 
                         happiest doing.

               guenevere overhears. she approaches and lancelot jumps to 
               his feet.

                                     guenevere
                              (to arthur)
                         he must stay for the feasting days 
                         of our wedding, and tell his deeds 
                         himself.

                                     arthur
                              (to lancelot, smiling)
                         i grant you your wish if you grant 
                         lady guenevere hers.

                                     lancelot
                         i will stay madame.

               merlin leans close to arthur.

                                     merlin
                         the knights of galys approach the 
                         camp. it would be politic...

                                     arthur
                         ...to ride out and meet them.

               he rises. lancelot, who was about to sit again, straightens.

                                     arthur
                         i will ride with sir kay. lancelot, 
                         rest here.

                                     guenevere
                         don't start a war on my wedding day!

                                     arthur
                         without lancelot?!

               arthur and merlin exit, leaving guenevere and lancelot. she 
               looks at him, lively and amused, and he can't help smiling.

                                     guenevere
                         look lancelot. the maids and ladies 
                         whisper about you. they all dream of 
                         winning you, young and old, fair and 
                         ugly.

               lancelot blushes.

                                     guenevere
                         but surely that's no secret to you, 
                         dear lancelot. you're the bravest 
                         and strongest knight they've ever 
                         seen, and beauty has kissed your 
                         brow.

               he can't look at her.

                                     guenevere
                         the well-kept secret is whether any 
                         of them has won your heart.

                                     lancelot
                         no.

                                     guenevere
                         why?

                                     lancelot
                         i am a fighting man and i am married 
                         to the quest. that is enough.

                                     guenevere
                         and there is no maiden in the whole 
                         world who inspires you?

                                     lancelot
                         there is one.

                                     guenevere
                         who?!

                                     lancelot
                         you.

                                     guenevere
                         me?

                                     lancelot
                         yes. i would swear my love to you.

                                     guenevere
                         to me? but why?

                                     lancelot
                         i cannot love as a woman the lady 
                         who will be wife to my king and my 
                         friend. and, in pledging my love to 
                         you, i cannot love any other woman.

               guenevere smiles, moved by his blunt innocence.

                                     lancelot
                         i will see you in all women, and i 
                         will defend them as i would defend 
                         you.

               he kneels, kisses her thigh, rises and leaves.
