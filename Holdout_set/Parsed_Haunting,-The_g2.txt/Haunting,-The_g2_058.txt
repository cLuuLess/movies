     int. great hall - night

     -- then almost silence.  we pull back from the children's faces on 
     the doors of the great hall to reveal the vast room standing in 
     darkness.  covens of strange shapes consort in the shadows, things 
     that in the day would be lamps, the stuff of life.  but now, at the 
     very deepest limit of human hearing, it is as if something exhales.
