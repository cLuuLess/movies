     int. red parlor - dusk

     nell and theo enter a room just off the landing, a lavish parlor 
     with the omnipresent panelled walls, lush red carpet, velvet 
     curtains sweeping floor to ceiling, heavy pieces of furniture.  nell 
     watches theo explore.  as theo moves through the room, nell's eye 
     lands on another painting of hugh crain.  inside it's ornate golden 
     framework, distinctive little cherubs are embedded.  cherubs of 
     death... she runs her fingers over it.

                               theo
                   maybe you shouldn't touch --

     theo twirls out of the room, nell, anxious, behind her.
