     int. grand entry - day (continuous)

     -- a vast entry towering away to a ceiling lost in shadow far 
     above.  rays of light filter through floor-to-ceiling curtains.  
     doors lead off in a half dozen directions.

     every piece of woodwork or plaster in the house is carved, 
     filigreed, painted or ornamented in wild, ornate fashion.  it 
     overwhelms the eye.

                               nell
                   wow...

     she turns around, sets her suitcase on the marble floor.  a short
     hallway straight ahead seems to let onto some vast space, dimly 
     lit.

     and then nell hears a sound.  carrying through the empty halls from
     some distant place: a low, plaintive moan.

     nell freezes.  the moaning stops.  nell strains her ears.  and then 
     the moan again.  it comes from the short hallway ahead.  nell 
     starts for it.  the moan stops.
