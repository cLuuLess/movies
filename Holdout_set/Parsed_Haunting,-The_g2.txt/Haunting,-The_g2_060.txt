     int. hall outside locked room - night

     eyes.  eyes of all the mythological figures.  staring down the long,
     black hallway.  awaiting something.  afraid.

     at the end of the hallway, where all eyes are staring, the double
     doors, the ones that scared nell and theo stand shut.

     that something gathering at the edge of our hearing rises.  rises as 
     if the house itself is breathing.
