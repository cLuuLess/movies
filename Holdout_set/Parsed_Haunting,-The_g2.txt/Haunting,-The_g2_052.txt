     int. red parlor - night

     the harp sings out, lively, expertly played by mary.  theo, luke, 
     todd and nell are impressed with her skill.

                               mary
                   it's an erard.  late 1870s.

     she plays, and as she does, she's aware of the room, and the house,
     and she sees something in a curtain or the fireplace, or a window,
     something at the edge of perception.  she suddenly stops.

                               nell
                   what's wrong?

                               mary
                   the harp is out of tune.

     she finds a key and begins tightening the strings -- as marrow bangs
     open the door, briefcase in one hand, cell phone in the other.  he
     can't conceal his irritation.  marrow removes folders from his
     briefcase, passes them around while she plays.  nell again studies 
     the cherub of death on the spine of the leather bound books.

                               marrow
                   i'll have to count david watts as 
                   a no-show.  so let's start.  thank 
                   you, mary.

     that was a little abrupt, she feels it.  everybody finds a chair or
     spot on the sofa.  mary remains on the stool by the harp.  marrow 
     sits in a large winged-back chair.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   all right?  so, to answer your 
                   earlier question, todd, why are we 
                   here?  what do we all need in 
                   life, what are the basics?  we 
                   need food, we need water, we need 
                   sleep.  sleep.  all of you resist 
                   it?  why?  what does that mean?  
                   why do we resist sleep?  my field 
                   of study is the individual's 
                   psychology of emotion and 
                   performance.

                               luke
                   so why did you need the addam's 
                   family mansion for a scientific 
                   test?

                               marrow
                   i thought it best to be isolated, 
                   to be in a location with a 
                   definite sense of history, and i 
                   wanted to make sure that it wasn't 
                   so pleasant you'd all sleep too 
                   easily.  you'll be taking a 
                   variety of tests, none of them 
                   harmful, and you've got the house, 
                   the grounds, and each other to 
                   keep you company.

                               theo
                   when do we take the tests?

                               marrow
                   every day.  basically we'll be 
                   hanging out together like we have 
                   so far this evening.

     nell and theo are looking through their folders: sheets of paper,
     bizarre geometric puzzles.

                               marrow
                   also, there is no phone service to 
                   the house and no tv.  i have the 
                   cell phone for emergencies.  we'll 
                   begin the tests after breakfast 
                   tomorrow.  

     the others shuffle through papers, nell and todd intent on them, 
     theo interested but not overly so, luke, bored.

                               mary
                   dr. marrow, what is this house?

     when she says this, we should be seeing her from an odd perspective,
     the house's pov.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   there was once a king who built a 
                   palace.  the king's name was hugh 
                   crain.  a hundred and thirty years 
                   ago, when the merrimack valley was 
                   the center of american industry, 
                   hugh crain made two hundred 
                   million dollars.  that's forty-
                   three billion dollars in today's 
                   money.  he could have anything he 
                   wanted.  and what he wanted, was 
                   rene, his banker's beautiful 
                   daughter.  rene, and a house 
                   filled with children.

                               nell
                   all the carvings.

                               marrow
                   but there's a sad catch to the 
                   story.

                               mary
                   what happened?

                               marrow
                   there were no children.  rene 
                   died, and then hugh crain built
                   all of this, and then he died.  
                   his heart was broken.

     nell shifts, looks at the house with a strange feeling.

                               nell
                   that's so sad.

     this has been tense between them, a gunfight.  pop!  a log in the
     fireplace makes everyone jump.  theo relishes it, but nell shudders.

                               mary
                   i think there's more to the story. 
                   this house has its own music, 
                   doctor marrow, i can play it for 
                   you, i can hear it.

     mary plays, channeling unholy music from the house, from the walls,
     from the curtain, from the air.  her fingers fly down the harp to 
     the thickest wire and --

     -- tang!  like a steel whip the wire snaps.

     mary screams in pain.

                               mary
                   my eye... oh... my eye... my 
                   eye... oh... no...

     the others leap up in shock.  blood lines the wall behind her.  she
     clutches at her eye, more blood spilling out from between her 
     fingers.

                               todd
                   oh jesus.

     marrow and theo rush over to her as she shrieks in pain.

     todd is frozen, pale, like he's about to be sick.  nell turns the 
     other way, but not because she's scared -- she's searching for a 
     shot glass on a side table.

     marrow wraps mary in his arms.  her shrieking becomes a terrified 
     but quieter wail.

                               marrow
                   mary, let me see your eye.

     nell appears by his side with the glass.  marrow pries mary's hand 
     from her face.

     blood flows freely from the eyelid, but her eye is intact.

                               nell
                   here, cover it.  don't let her 
                   touch it.
