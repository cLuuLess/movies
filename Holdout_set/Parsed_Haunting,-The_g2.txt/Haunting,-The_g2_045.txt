     int. hall of mirrors - dusk (continuous)

     through a narrow passageway, and large double doors they suddenly
     stand at the threshold of a fantastic ballroom lined with mirrors 
     and chandeliers.  rows of mirror-coated octagonal pillars, rise to a
     vaulted, mirrored ceiling far above.  with the door opening, there's 
     a click, and a mechanism of some sort is activated.  the floor 
     begins to move like a slow turntable.

     theo comes right up, looks over nell's shoulder.  nell steps out.

     she traipses out across the room, her million reflections waltzing
     with her into infinity.  theo dances after her.  they dance, not 
     quite together.  nell stops and pronounces:

                               nell
                   i love this house.  i really love 
                   this house.

                               theo
                          (gently, recognizes 
                           that nell is 
                           different)
                   you're okay.

     nell blushes... and they burst out laughing.  they take off running,
     their reflections with them, stampeding for an archway on the far 
     side of the room and out --
