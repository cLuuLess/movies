     int. cross hall - night

     halls sprawl away into darkness in all directions as nell tries to
     feel out where she is, and realizes she's lost.  just like theo and 
     she were before.  but now it's night.  and she's alone.  she's been 
     tricked.

     panting, she stops, presses herself against the wall.  her breath
     catches.

     across from her is a mirror.  herself reflected in its tarnished
     surface.  but there is something wrong with it.  nell steps across 
     to it.

     her reflected self begins to smile.  but she's not smiling!  nell
     writhes in horror, but can't pull away from the mirror.  in it, her
     grin widens, insane.  the bottom half of her face is someone else's.

     bang!  nell recoils.  the sound breaks the spell, knocking nell back
     from the mirror.

     bang.  bang.  bang.  nell turns and runs.
