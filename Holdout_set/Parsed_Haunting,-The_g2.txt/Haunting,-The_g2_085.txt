     int. hallway outside locked room - day

     nell and theo walk down the long hallway behind, opening doors,
     checking rooms.

                               nell
                   david?

                               theo
                   maybe he never came in.  if he'd 
                   come in, he would have left his 
                   bags at the door, right?  or maybe 
                   he got here early, and went for a 
                   walk, and fell.  maybe he's 
                   outside.

     nell closes a door on the right, and then stops dead.  staring.

     the shut, dark, door, the one that scared nell and theo earlier,
     awaits them at the end.  ominous.

     nell approaches.  closer and closer.  the door nears.

     nell wraps her arms tightly about herself and try's to open the 
     door.  it's locked.  her breath fogs the air.  she doesn't notice 
     it.  but then she suddenly gags.  with a look of horror she recoils 
     from the door, choking, covering her face.

     then theo smells it.  the women are both sick from the smell.

                               theo (cont'd)
                   oh my god, what is it?  oh, the 
                   smell... ohhh.

     marrow comes into the hallway.  he sees them from a distance.

     on the two women.

                               theo
                          (looks to nell for 
                           an answer)
                   is it over?

                               nell
                   no, it's getting worse.

                               marrow
                   nell!  what's wrong?

                               nell
                   that smell... oh, god.

     theo blanches, looks at nell.  she smells it too, and in mirror 
     image fashion backs away from the doors also.  marrow notices the 
     exchange, and watches them, intense.  and then, in a heartbeat, the 
     moment is over.
