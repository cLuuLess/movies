     int. nell's room - night (continuous)

     -- and stumble into nell's room.  marrow's mouth opens.  luke stands
     speechless.  they're stricken by the sight: nell screaming, held by 
     the headboard as the deformed ceiling dips over her, the room 
     thrusting at her rhythmically.  nell and theo make eye contact.

                               theo
                   oh, jesus.

     marrow recovers, reaches out for nell, and the face in the ceiling
     turns on him.  the gaze stops marrow in his tracks.  he looks up 
     into it and knows it's real.  somehow, it is crain.

     luke appears from out of nowhere on the other side of the bed and
     smashes off one of the wooden hands with a large brass candelabra.
     nell screams in surprise, but theo drags her out of the bed.

     the head turns to them.  they flee.  marrow backs away in awe and 
     fear.
