     int. grand entry - night

     luke yells and throws himself at the front doors.  marrow runs over 
     to help him and shoves the tire iron between the doors and pries.  
     marrow throws the useless thing down and stands back.

     luke joins him, and they shoulder block it together.  but this door 
     is massive.  there's no way.

                               luke
                   no you bastard!  break!

     he roundhouse kicks it, hurts himself.

     theo, afraid, watches the great hall behind them.  nell puts her 
     hand on her shoulder.

                               nell
                   it's not safe for you anymore.  
                   the children need me, and crain is 
                   doing everything he can to keep me 
                   from them.

     theo stares, appalled.  marrow looks around, puts his hand up to 
     shush everyone.  the house moans, the bumping growing, searching.

                               marrow
                   come on.

     he rushes down the hall, luke right beside him, nell and theo in 
     their wake.
