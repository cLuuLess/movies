     int. mezzanine - sunset (continuous)

     -- the mezzanine at the top of the stairs.  she searches in vain 
     for a light switch there.  finally she spots a set of curtains and 
     slings them open.

     the light, late-day though it is, makes her wince.  the window 
     looks down on the driveway.  outside a beige car crunches over the 
     gravel.  somebody else has arrived.

     nell watches the car move past, trying to get a glimpse of the 
     driver, but from up here, all she can see is roof.

                               nell
                   finally.

     she backs away from the window, spins around --

     -- and out of the darkness, powerful, mad, looms the visage of hugh
     crain.  it is the painting.  it is only from up here on the second 
     floor with this curtain open that the face is visible in the late-
     day sunlight.

     despite the artist's discretion, the lines in the man's skin, his
     eyes, his posture, cry of unspeakable sickness.

     unconsciously, nell takes a step back.  in the far b.g., near the 
     end of one of the halls, a door stands open, the second or third 
     set of doors in the gothic hallway left of the painting.  just as 
     it starts to come into view, and we're starting to see it, it 
     swings silently shut.

     but nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye.
