     int. nell's bathroom - night

     luke sits on the closed toilet and watches nell in the adjoining 
     room.  light from the bathroom falls across her fetal, curled form 
     in the bed.

     the door to theo's room is open too.  luke glances over.  theo lies 
     on her bed.  marrow is slouched in a chair.

     luke settles back against the wall.

     the house exhales, and the breath of the house is like the poppy 
     field in the wizard of oz; it brings on sleep.
