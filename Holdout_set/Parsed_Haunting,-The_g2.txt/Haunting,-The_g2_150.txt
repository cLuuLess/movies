     ext. main gate - night

     marrow hurries around the back of the car, staying clear of the lake
     of gas spreading about it.  luke rolls off.  marrow helps him up, 
     and gets him away a safe distance.

                               luke
                   i'm okay.  okay.  just my chest.  
                   just my wind knocked out.

     marrow looks up at the gate.  it is even more impassible than before
     with the gasoline-saturated wreck in it.  no way to try another 
     break-out either.

                               luke (cont'd)
                   sorry about your car, nell.

     he turns around.  the others do too.

     no nell.  luke and theo look up.  mute dread.  no nell anywhere.

                               marrow
                   oh, no.
