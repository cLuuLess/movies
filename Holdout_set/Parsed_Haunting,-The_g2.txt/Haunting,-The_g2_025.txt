     ext. hill house - day

     her car sits in front of the house, tiny, alone.  its brake lights 
     go off.

     the finger-like pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning 
     the car in place under the house's gaze.

     nell gets out of the car.

     nell stares, daunted... yet there is something about the house.  a
     romance in its lilac heavy gothic decay.  nell feels it, is drawn 
     to it.
