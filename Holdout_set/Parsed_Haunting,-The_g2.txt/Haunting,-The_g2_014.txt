     int. nell's car - day

     countryside speeds by.  she passes an antique store in a barn.  a
     handpainted sign warns melby's apple farm 100 yards.  nell grabs 
     for the window handle, letting in air.

     she snorts, smelling, breathing like it was the first time in her
     life... sounding like a pig.  and it makes her burst out in
     embarrassing, animal laughter.
