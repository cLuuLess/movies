     int. statuary hall - dusk (continuous)

     -- into a wide hall lined with niches and classical statuary.  theo
     strides down it pointing left and right, bending over, straddling 
     the pieces, provocative:

                               theo
                   here.  here.  here.
                          (under a leering 
                           gargoyle)
                   oh yes!  oh yes oh yes!  here!

     nell laughs -- appalled and loving every minute of it.

                               theo (cont'd)
                   can't you just see it?

                               nell
                   theo!
