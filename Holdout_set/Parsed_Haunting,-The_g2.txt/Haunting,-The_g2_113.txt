     int. hallway outside locked room - night

     -- into the long, dark hall leading to the locked room.  the 
     statuary peer down on her.  dead faces.  blind marble eyes.  as she 
     turns, the heads and eyes turn imperceptibly with her.

     for a frame or two the eyes are real, just a subliminal glimmer.  
     for the instant we try to catch the movement, the illusion, it isn't
     there.  it makes nell stop.  she regards the terrible doors.  she
     considers the labyrinth around her.  and begins to understand.

                               nell
                   the house... it's a maze, that's 
                   how you designed it, didn't you, 
                   mister crain?  so wherever one of 
                   your little guests went, the house 
                   brought them here.  it's designed 
                   to make you come here.  but why?

     another cry comes from the far end.

     nell eases down the hallway, the fear welling back on her like a 
     tide.  she hesitates, but then the child-cry forces her on.  she 
     reaches the carved doors with the wooden guard statues.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   oh, no... oh... no... no, no... 
                   not that... oh no... ohhhhhhhhh!

     gaping cold and stench hit her.  she gags.

     now the cry comes from under the door.  present.  real.  right 
     there.  nell shudders.

     the cry grows louder, desperate.  she shuts her ears to it.  the cry
     rises to fearsome rage, not sounding like a child anymore.  not
     sounding like anything human at all, it's painful.  nell looks at 
     the locked room in horror and takes off running.
