     int. sick room - day (continuous)

     -- what once was a dining room.  transformed into a sick room.  
     drawn shades.  dim.  the first traces of dust.

     nell lingers in the doorway a beat, daunted.

     a perfectly made bed.  the pillow, however retains the impression 
     of a head.  lodged between the bed and a nightstand, a cane.  on 
     the opposite side of the bed is a plastic toilet.  i.v. stand.  
     shrouded white shapes.

     on the wall above the bed, a framed needlepoint counsels: a place 
     for everything, everything in its place.  a bit of wisdom.  a way 
     to live a life.

     a way nell has lived for too long.  seeing it galvanizes her into
     movement.  she goes to an old armoire, a medicine chest, opens it,
     removes a bottle of tylenol with codeine and marches out.
