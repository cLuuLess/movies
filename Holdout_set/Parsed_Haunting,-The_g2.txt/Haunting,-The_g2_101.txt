     int. nell's room - night

     nell, her breathing heavy, lies tangled in her heavy blankets, 
     asleep, but restless.  her feet hang off the end of the bed.

     in the b.g., the door to the bathroom is shut, barely visible in the
     faint light from the window.  hold on it.

     silently, it begins to open.  the gap widens, yawning, pitch dark
     beyond.  a long beat.  and then a thump.  a sliding sound.  
     something drags itself across the floor.

     bump.  slide.  our line of sight is blocked by the bed.  but the 
     sound is getting louder, coming closer.

     bump.  slide.  nell grinds her teeth in her sleep, pulls the 
     blankets about her tighter.  bump.  the sound stops.  and her breath 
     begins to fog.

     whatever has just come in the room is right there, hovering just oc.
     we can feel it.

     without warning nell bolts upright, gasping into consciousness.
     reveal: nothing.  just the dark room.  and the bathroom door open.

     nell stares at the-door, knows she shut it.  now it's open.  she 
     breaths fast, feeling the cold, knowing something's in here with 
     her.

     she stops breathing, strains her ears.  silence.  a long moment.  
     then she notices her feet, hanging out from under the covers.

     they are black.  feel slick.  nell turns on the light by her bed and
     looks down.

     her feet are covered in gore.  where theo had been painting.  nell
     screams.
