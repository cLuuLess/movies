     int. greenhouse - night

     marrow, luke and theo enter the greenhouse, the heavy growth
     forbidding in the darkness.  they spread out on the parallel 
     walkways.

                               theo
                   nell?

     they reach the transept, turn down it toward the statue of crain at
     the end looming white in the dusk.

     dead silence.  then marrow screams.

     under a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that protrudes
     from the pond we find watt's body, as if the hand wants to keep him
     there forever.  marrow did find his watts, a horrifying sight.

                               marrow
                   oh my god it's watts.

     as at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a 
     river of blood, scaring the hell out of them.  their clothes 
     splattered with blood, marrow quickly leads them out of there.
