     int. kitchen - night

     nell and theo, wrapped in blankets, sit over mugs of tea at the
     kitchen table.  marrow, across from them, clicks off his digital
     recorder.  luke paces behind the women.

                               nell
                   you really didn't hear anything?

     marrow takes his glasses off.  luke looks at him, then goes to the
     kitchen sink.  he turns both faucets on full blast and leans up 
     against the sink, arms folded.  theo and nell turn to look at him.  
     a beat.  and then:

     bump.  bump bump.  it's the sound.  luke goes over to the door, 
     pushes it open.

                               luke
                   oh, look!  there he goes, ol' hugh 
                   crain!
