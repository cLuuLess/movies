     int. kitchen - night

     luke lets the door shut, turns off the faucet.  the sounds of the
     plumbing die away.

                               luke
                   do you need me anymore?  cause i'm 
                   going to bed.  they can stay up 
                   talking another 45 minutes if they 
                   want, but i gotta try to get some 
                   sleep.

                               marrow
                   go ahead.

     luke leaves the kitchen.  theo and nell watch him go.

                               theo
                   if this was some sort of joke, i'm 
                   going to kill him.

                               nell
                   you know it wasn't a joke, theo.

     marrow watches the exchange closely.

                               marrow
                   the cold sensation.  who felt it 
                   first?

                               nell
                   theo i think.  you've asked us 
                   that three times, doctor marrow.  
                   what's going on?

                               marrow
                   how do you feel about luke's 
                   suggestion that it was just the 
                   old plumbing?  water hammer, 
                   something like that?

     theo and nell look at each other in frustration.  but theo tries to 
     get her mind around the question.

                               theo
                   i did just take a bath.  i don't 
                   know.
