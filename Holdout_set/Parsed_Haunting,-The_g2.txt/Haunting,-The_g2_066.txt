     int. nell's room - night

     nell's room stands silent, dark.  the door to the bathroom is shut.  
     the lock slides open.  the door swings in.  luke stands there, the 
     two women behind him.

     luke turns on the lights.  the room is perfectly ordinary, no sign 
     that anything has been in here.  the door to the hall is shut.  nell 
     reacts.
