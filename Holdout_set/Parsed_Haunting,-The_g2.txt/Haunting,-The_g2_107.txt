     int. great hall - day

     nell, blinded by tears, runs across the room toward the grand entry
     and the exit... and stops.

     down the connecting hall, out in the grand entry, at the front 
     doors, are mr. and mrs. dudley.  leaving for the day.  they stop.  
     look at her.

     nell, numb, gazes from the open door to mrs. dudley.  mr. dudley 
     holds the door open as if in invitation.  nell could walk out right 
     now.  this is her chance.  but...

     mrs. dudley smiles a knowing smile.  an all too knowing smile.  and
     seeing nell's decision, gently shuts the door.  the lock clicks.  
     final.  fate-sealing.

     nell turns back to the house, lost.
