     ext. gate - dawn

     theo and marrow stand on the far side of nell's wrecked car.  on the
     other side of the gate mr. dudley is undoing the chain.  mrs. dudley
     stares at the ragged duo.

                               mrs. dudley
                          (her final verdict)
                   city people.

     mr. dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car
     crushed in it.  theo and marrow emerge, dazed, into the real world
     again.

                               mr. dudley
                   you find out what you wanted to 
                   know, mister?

     marrow stares at him, he's an exhausted man.  he walks away, theo
     beside him.

                               theo
                   i'm not going back to new york 
                   city.  i'm going to find an 
                   apartment with a little flower 
                   garden, where you can just see the 
                   ocean and at night, when the wind 
                   comes in just right, you can hear 
                   the sound of the harbor.  what 
                   about you?

                               marrow
                   i'm a scientist.  i just conducted 
                   an experiment.  now i have to 
                   write it up.

                               theo
                   but the experiment was a failure.

     now, we could have him say this line...

                               marrow
                   was it?

     but he should just look at her, and say the same thing with his 
     eyes.

     we pull back.
