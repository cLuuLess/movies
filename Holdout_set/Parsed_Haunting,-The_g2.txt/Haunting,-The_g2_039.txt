     int. theo's room - day

     mrs. dudley opens the door, letting theo and nell into a large 
     bedroom, a mirror-image twin of nell's room, except it's decorated 
     in rich red-orange velvets.

                               theo
                   this is so twisted.

     she dumps her stuff on the floor, grabs a banister on the four-
     poster bed, swings cat-like onto its high mattress.

                               mrs. dudley
                   i set dinner on the dining room 
                   sideboard at six.

     mrs. dudley lays theo's suitcase on a luggage stand.

                               mrs. dudley
                   breakfast is at nine.  i don't 
                   stay after dinner.  not after it 
                   begins to get dark.

     theo, back to mrs.  dudley, rolls her eyes at nell.

                               mrs. dudley (cont'd)
                   i leave, before dark.  so there 
                   won't be anyone around if you need 
                   help.

                               nell
                   we couldn't even hear you.

     mrs. dudley looks up at nell who mimics her scary smile.

                               mrs. dudley
                   no one could.  no one lives any 
                   nearer than town.

                               nell
                   no one will come any nearer than 
                   that.

     mrs. dudley smiles at nell, but it's softer than before.

                               mrs. dudley
                   in the night.  in the dark.

     theo leans on the bed, musing at the exchange.  and then mrs. dudley
     backs out of the room, shuts the door.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   my room is right next door.  i 
                   think we share a bathroom.

     theo has an interesting eye on nell, she's studying her.

                               theo
                   don't worry, i probably won't be 
                   in here much.  light sleeper.

                               nell
                   that's why we're here.

                               theo
                   what do you do?

                               nell
                   i'm between jobs right now.  my 
                   last job... it... the person i was 
                   working for... the job ended.  
                   over.  so... and you?

                               theo
                   that depends.

     theo pops a dress bag on the bed, unzips it.  theo takes off her 
     coat, and is only wearing a black bra underneath.  nell reacts, 
     turns away.  back to the camera, theo flicks off her bra, stretches.

                               theo (cont'd)
                   i'm supposed to be an artist, but 
                   i've been really distracted from 
                   work by love.  do you know what i 
                   mean?

                               nell
                   not really.

                               theo
                   don't tell me boston is different 
                   from new york.

                               nell
                          (she knows this 
                           from magazines)
                   ohh, sure, you have trouble with
                   commitment.

                               theo
                   my boyfriend thinks so, my 
                   girlfriend doesn't.  if we could 
                   all live together... but... they 
                   hate each other.  it's hard to be 
                   miss perversity when you're the 
                   only one at the party.  d'you know 
                   what i mean?

                               nell
                   no.

                               theo
                          (delighted)
                   a blank canvas!  i could paint 
                   your portrait, directly on you.  
                   or maybe not.  so, you?  husbands?  
                   boyfriends?  girlfriends?  where 
                   do you live?

                               nell
                   i don't have anyone.
                          (beat, lying)
                   but i do have a little apartment 
                   of my own.  it has a little flower 
                   garden.  you can just see the 
                   ocean.  at night, when the wind 
                   comes in just right, you can hear 
                   the buoys in the harbor.

     nell peeks, sees theo is decent, turns around.

                               theo
                   that sounds really nice.  you're 
                   lucky.  but you know that.

     theo comes over, straightens nell's seams; this is an intimate,
     forward gesture.

                               theo (cont'd)
                          (with meaning)
                   come on, we've seen enough of the 
                   bedroom for now.
