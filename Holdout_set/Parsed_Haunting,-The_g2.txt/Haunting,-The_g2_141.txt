     ext. hill house driveway/gate - night

     four cars sit behind the massive, locked gate, as far from hill 
     house as possible.  marrow paces past the fence, staring out, the 
     road beyond leading out of this place, so close...

     luke digs with a pen knife at the marble footing below the gate.  no
     easy way under it.  he stands and gazes at the razor-sharp spikes
     twenty feet up.  there's no way to climb this.

                               theo
                   oh my god we need to call someone?

     marrow just looks at her and walks back to nell's car.
