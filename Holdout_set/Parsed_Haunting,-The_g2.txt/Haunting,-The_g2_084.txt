     int. kitchen - day

     marrow comes through the kitchen.  mrs. dudley, chopping carrots,
     stands by the counter.  only the slightest pause in the rhythm of 
     her chopping says she's noticed him.

                               marrow
                   do you know who these keys belong 
                   to?

                               mrs. dudley
                   no.

                               marrow
                   i was expecting another guest 
                   yesterday.  a man, david watts.  
                   did you see him?

                               mrs. dudley
                   no.

                               marrow
                   is your husband around?  i'd like 
                   to --

     frustrated, he continues on.
