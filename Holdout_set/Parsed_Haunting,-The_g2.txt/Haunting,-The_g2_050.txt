     int. great hall - night

     marrow leads the way across the hall.  the others check out the
     furnishings as they pass.

                               todd
                   these old victorian houses are 
                   great, aren't they?

                               luke
                          (points to details; 
                           adjust for set)
                   it's not victorian, everyone 
                   thinks that the whole nineteenth 
                   century was victorian.  this is 
                   gothic, this is english craftsman, 
                   this is romanesque.  this is... 
                   insane.  who lives here?

                               marrow
                   nobody.  a local mill owner, hugh 
                   crain, built it in 1830.  he had 
                   no heirs, but he put the house in 
                   trust, and the farmland around it, 
                   with the stipulation that it never 
                   be altered or sold.  crain's 
                   executors made good investments 
                   and for the last hundred and 
                   twenty years, hill house has taken 
                   care of itself.

     mary is shaken by the house, but she's honoring marrow's request.
     everywhere she looks, she feels the presence of something.

                               todd
                   so what's this study all about 
                   anyway?  mary described the kind 
                   of tests we'll be doing, but 
                   didn't fill us in on the big 
                   picture.  she said you needed bad 
                   sleepers, but this wasn't about 
                   curing the problem.

                               mary
                   i can tell you what this is about.

                               marrow
                   eat first, questions later, mary, 
                   please.

     they exit the hall, mary and nell last, and as they do, nell sees
     mary's strange look.  she stops.

                               nell
                   is something wrong?

                               mary
                   no.  just... when i saw your 
                   picture i had a feeling about you, 
                   and now that i meet you, i know i 
                   was right.

                               nell
                   what?

                               mary
                   eat first, questions later.

     and suddenly awkward, mary exits after the others.
