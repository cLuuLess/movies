     int. hallway outside locked room - dusk (continuous)

     they stand at the end of a long hallway to one of the house's
     forgotten outlying wings.  it is dark.  too dark.  nell and theo 
     regard the darkness.

     at the far end of the hall stand a pair of mahogany doors, closed,
     almost black, oily-looking.  surrounding them, an enormously complex
     geometrical frieze.

     the doors themselves are plain.  in their simplicity there is 
     something about them enormously disturbing.  it is as if the doors 
     are looking back at them, nell goes cold.  theo holds herself.

                               nell
                   we should go back.

     theo nods.  they turn around, theo opening what she thinks was the 
     door they came through.
