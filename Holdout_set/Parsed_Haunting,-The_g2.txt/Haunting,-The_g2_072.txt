     int. nell's room - night

     nell lies asleep under her sheet, the blankets off the end of the 
     bed.  hovering over her, on the headboard, the carved faces of 
     children, peering down.

     flap.  flap flap.  the fan-light at the top of the window right next 
     to the bed is open a crack.  the sheer curtains flap listlessly in a
     gentle breeze.  the flapping grows louder, and with a sudden gust 
     the curtain billows out.  in its flowing form, we sense the shape of 
     a girl's face, fleeting, so insubstantial we know we just saw her, 
     but maybe our eyes are playing tricks on us.

     the curtain blows straight out, touching the bedposts at the foot of
     the bed, and there the wind catches the fabric hanging from them.  
     the wind seem to sneak under the bedcover and the shape follows...

     nell sleeps, oblivious, the wind filling the room, stirring the
     tinkling crystal beads on the candelabra.  the shape of the little
     girl's face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the pillows,
     toward nell.

     nell turns, restless, the air catches the edge of the pillowcase, 
     and travels towards nell's face.  and for a split second there is a
     lifelike impression of a small girl's face.  nell almost awakens.  
     the crystal beads stir, and in their tinkling, in the sigh of wind, 
     we hear:

                               girl voice
                   find us, find us eleanor.

     nell's eyes open.  and like that, the pillowcase deflates, the air
     rushes up the curtain to the window, and is gone.

     nell sits up, looks about her.  everything seems normal.  just her
     sheets, just the curtains, but on the headboard remain the carved
     faces.  benevolent.  nell settles back down on her pillow with a 
     sense of peace.
