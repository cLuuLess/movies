     int. nell's room - day

     nell lowers her suitcase.

                               mrs. dudley
                   the purple room.  you're going to 
                   be the first visitors that hill 
                   house has had since mister crain 
                   died.

     the room is spacious, in a rococo gothic style with low-relief
     woodwork on the walls rising to a dark, coffered, ceiling of carved
     ivory.  a king-size bed, furniture, all in blue purple.  an open 
     door gives a glimpse of a bathroom.

     a large fireplace dominates one wall.  its mantle is carved with 
     the faces of children, happy, at play, alive.  nell touches the 
     wood, loving.

                               nell
                   they're so beautiful.  aren't 
                   they?

                               mrs. dudley
                   i've seen 'em.  lot to dust.

                               nell
                   well, i've never lived with 
                   beauty.  you must love working 
                   here.

     mrs. dudley peers at her.  a beat.  and then, cryptic:

                               mrs. dudley
                   it's a job.  i keep banker's 
                   hours.  i set dinner on the dining 
                   room sideboard at six.  you can 
                   serve yourselves.  breakfast is 
                   ready at nine.  i don't wait on 
                   people.  i don't stay after 
                   dinner.  not after it begins to 
                   get dark.  i leave before dark 
                   comes.  we live in town.  nine 
                   miles.  so there won't be anyone 
                   around if you need help.  we 
                   couldn't even hear you, in the 
                   night.

                               nell
                   why would we --

                               mrs. dudley
                   -- no one could.  no one lives any 
                   nearer than town.  no one will 
                   come any nearer than that.  in the 
                   night.  in the dark.

     and with that mrs. dudley grins, rictus-like.  she turns and closes 
     the door after her.

     nell stands there a long moment, the room silent, heavy, old.  she 
     goes to the windows, peers out.  nothing but forest for miles.  the
     sun is setting.

     nell removes her windbreaker, opens her suitcase, takes out a 
     blouse and skirt.  decent enough clothes, but cheap, the tags still 
     on them.
