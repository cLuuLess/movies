     int. nell's room - night

     nell lies there afraid to move, afraid to make the faintest sound.
     from the darkness above wood creaks.  at first it seems like someone 
     is walking on the floor above.  but it is coming from within the 
     room.

     the carvings on the ceiling, the impossibly elaborate woodwork, are
     moving.  incredibly slowly, with incredible subtlety: turning inside
     out, some of the forms lengthening, some shortening.  carvings 
     changing here, changing there -- the ceiling coming alive -- with 
     some grand design we sense but cannot yet see.

     the wood grows out of the ceiling eating its way down into the tall
     bed posters.  it crawls down the posters, straining the sinewy 
     baroque curves, swelling them...

     the creaking begins from the darkness of the wall opposite nell.  
     nell inclines her head to see.  out of the wall two enormous bulges 
     grow, side by side.

     from behind nell, now.  the headboard groans, its shapes moving, the
     fan-like plant designs thickening and splaying wide.

     nell can't move, her mind refusing to understand what's going on.  
     the bulges in the wall droop to the floor.  and then we begin to 
     see: they are like a pair of knees.

     understanding starts to show in nell's eyes.  she looks up at the
     ceiling.  and now all the movement, the design behind the awful
     transformation of the ceiling is clear.

     it is a head.  a visage of madness, of absolute horror, eyelids 
     sealing shut its blind face.

     silence.  nell's breath comes ragged.  unable to speak, but trying 
     to call out.

     the eyes open.  a scream tears out of nell's throat.
