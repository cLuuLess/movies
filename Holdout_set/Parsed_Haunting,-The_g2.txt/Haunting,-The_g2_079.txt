     int. carriage house - day

     light filters in through gaps in the wood.  luke opens one of the 
     main doors with a loud squeak, the sun revealing a tarp-covered 
     shape, a carriage.  unused in a hundred years.  a row of tarp-
     covered carriages fill the stalls into the distance.

                               luke
                   well, this lot is full!

                               theo
                   he must have left.  didn't like 
                   the looks of the place or 
                   something.

                               nell
                   how could he have left without his 
                   keys?

                               theo
                   two sets.  i don't know.  maybe 
                   they're not even his.

                               luke
                   then he's got to be in the 
                   house...

     as they leave, the camera lingers on a covered shape in one of the
     stalls, smaller than the other carriages, it could be a car.  a 
     broken wagon wheel leaning against it.
