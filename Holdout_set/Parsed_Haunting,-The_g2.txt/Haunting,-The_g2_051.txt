     int. dining room - night

     a chandelier hangs unlit over a long dining table.  laughter.  at 
     the end nell and the others sprawl over the remains of a dinner 
     which has been going on for hours.  luke is opening another bottle 
     of jug wine.

                               luke
                   you know what i love about wine 
                   that comes in bottles like this?

                               todd
                   what?

                               luke
                   every year is a good year.

                               marrow
                   theo?  it's your turn.

     theo twirls her wine glass, licks the dregs inside the rim, 
     thinking.

                               theo
                   the rest of you may hate your 
                   insomnia, but i find it the best 
                   time of the day for me.  i'm 
                   alone.  nobody's talking to me but 
                   myself.  my mind is racing with 
                   ideas, and i can think.

                               luke
                   nah, you're going crazy with 
                   doubt, all of your mistakes are 
                   coming back up the pipes, and it's 
                   worse than a nightmare. --

     nell isn't used to people being so direct and at the same time,
     playful.  she glances at marrow's left hand: no wedding ring.

                               theo (cont'd)
                   excuse me.

                               luke
                   don't give me that look, it's 
                   everybody's problem, we just have 
                   different variations, i for 
                   example.  i fall asleep easily.  
                   but i wake up around two or three 
                   in the morning, every morning.  
                   it's that time of night that 
                   fitzgerald called the deep dark 
                   night of the soul.  i stare 
                   into... the abyss.  every night.
                          (breaks his own 
                           somber mood)
                   it's the price i pay for being 
                   such a jolly fellow.
                          (to mary)
                   y usted?

                               mary
                   i think i'd fall asleep easily, 
                   but just as i start to feel 
                   comfortable, i see things in the 
                   dark.

     nell hears this, nell is tuned into mary.

                               mary
                   i feel the presence of something 
                   watching me.  it's not... scary... 
                   not by itself but... i don't want 
                   to go to sleep because i'm worried 
                   about the thing attacking me.  so 
                   when i finally do fall asleep, i'm 
                   like a soldier who's fallen asleep 
                   at her post.  i feel like i've 
                   betrayed myself.  nell?

     nell wishes she could hide under her plate.

                               nell
                   all of you have such interesting 
                   problems.

     there's laughter.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   no... please, i know how that 
                   sounds but... you're all so 
                   articulate.  you know how to talk.  
                   i feel like i'm here under false 
                   pretenses.  it's silly, it's not 
                   like... well, all of you have 
                   trouble sleeping because you live 
                   in the world, and the world is 
                   complicated and scary, but 
                   nothing's ever happened to me.  so 
                   i don't have a reason to sleep 
                   badly.

                               marrow
                   you wrote that you had trouble 
                   sleeping.

                               nell
                   yes, because someone was always 
                   keeping me awake.  ever since i 
                   was little.  that was my job.  i 
                   took care of my mother and i had 
                   to be there for her all night 
                   long, and she woke up all the 
                   time.  and after she died, well, 
                   it's been a few months, but i 
                   still, i still wake up, it's... a 
                   habit.
                          (beat)
                   i know we've only known each other 
                   a couple of hours, but i'm really 
                   glad to be with people who let me 
                   talk about this.  i'm really happy 
                   to be here with you.

     silence.  the others are embarrassed by her sincerity.  she's right,
     nell is not of their world.

                               marrow
                   we're glad you're here.

     he says this with enough sympathy for theo to see his interest in 
     the girl in the thrift shop dress.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   why don't we move to another room?
