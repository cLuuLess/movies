     ext. hill house driveway/gate - night

     theo pulls nell away from the drive.  marrow stands back from nell's
     car where luke belts in behind the wheel.

     luke eases the car forward to the gate.  he advances until the car's
     bumper makes contact.  and then without further ado, revs the 
     engine.

     the buick grinds into the heavy steel bars.  the chain tightens 
     around the two halves of the gate, but shows not the slightest 
     strain.
