     int. nell's car - night

     luke gasps for the seat belt, the wind knocked out of him, steering
     column pushed to his chest.  marrow and theo run up outside.  luke 
     sees him, sees he's not getting any closer than ten feet, and he's 
     looking back at the gas tank.

     luke gets the seatbelt off, tries to open the door but it's warped
     shut.  he struggles to get out from behind the wheel.  sparks jump 
     from the battery.  gas shoots out of the fuel pump onto the 
     shattered window.  he knows he's in trouble.

                               theo
                   hurry.  the gas!  luke... the gas!

     finally luke gets free of the wheel.  it's agonizing to watch...  
     the passenger door is jammed shut too.

     he squirms into the back seat.  the rear doors are in the same
     condition as the front.  but the rear window is blown out.  he 
     crawls out onto the trunk.
