     ext. 2nd floor balcony - day

     nell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the house's second
     floor.  the air stirs her hair.  she peers up at the house's 
     roofline, its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like 
     so many screaming heads.

     chilled, she pulls her sweater closer.  marrow comes out onto the
     balcony from twin french doors behind her.

                               nell
                   are you coming to confess?

                               marrow
                   i wish i were.  i wish i had done 
                   it, then i could confess and you'd 
                   be at peace.  that great moral 
                   philosopher frank sinatra once 
                   said to someone he loved, i wish 
                   you had an enemy, so i could beat 
                   him up.

     she smiles.

                               nell
                   let's say it wasn't you.  who did 
                   it?

                               marrow
                   i don't know.

                               nell
                   it was a stupid thing to do.

                               marrow
                   it was.

                               nell
                          (for the absurdity 
                           of the idea)
                   welcome home.

                               marrow
                   you'll never see it again.  mr. 
                   dudley's taking care of it.
                          (beat)
                   i'm sorry, nell.  can i show you 
                   something you'd like to see?

                               nell
                          (still too shaky 
                           for enthusiasm)
                   sure.
