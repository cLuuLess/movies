     int. 2nd floor hallway, north wing - day

     nell stares down the long hallway.  which door was it?

                               nell
                   hello?

     no response.  she starts down the hall, slow at first, then faster.

     she passes door after door, shadow after shadow, and as she nears 
     the end of the hall... there is no door here.  not within 20 feet 
     of, where we thought we just saw it.

     a whisper.  voices.  nell backs away.  and then laughter.  behind 
     her.  it's coming from another stairwell.  very real... and very 
     human.
