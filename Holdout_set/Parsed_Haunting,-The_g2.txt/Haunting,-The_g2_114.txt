     int. picture gallery - dusk

     nell bursts into the picture gallery and stops.  standing there are
     marrow, theo and luke, stricken silent by her entry.  looks of shock 
     on their faces.  nell just stands there.  a beat.  and then it pours 
     out of her, hysterical.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   he hunted all those children in 
                   here.  the dead children, josiah 
                   and elizabeth and all of them... 
                   from the books... he took them up 
                   here... he played games... the 
                   ones from his mills he burned them 
                   up in the fireplace but she found 
                   out what he did and she killed
                   him --

     she takes a breath, and turns gray.  before anyone else can react, 
     her legs go out from under her, and she lands sitting.  theo and 
     marrow get to her side fast.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   -- he didn't kill her she killed 
                   him and ran away with her baby --

     marrow grabs her face.  it's gray, her eyes glazing over.

                               marrow
                   get a blanket!

                               theo
                   it's okay... we're all here...

     luke races out.  theo, scared, looks at marrow.

                               theo (cont'd)
                   what's happening to her?

                               marrow
                   she's in shock.  come on.

     he starts to lift her.  theo takes her other side.

                               nell
                   after rene... after she killed 
                   herself... he turned into a 
                   monster.  he did fill the house 
                   with children... he did, but... 
                   they weren't laughing...

     nell is ugly, sprawling, in shock, as theo and marrow shuffle her to 
     a padded bench on one side of the room.

                               theo
                   nell, what happened?

                               nell
                   carolyn showed me where she hid 
                   him, hid him with all the ones he 
                   killed --

                               marrow
                   nell... please, nell... take a 
                   deep breath...

                               nell
                   and they're all locked together in 
                   here... and he won't let go of 
                   them!

     marrow grabs her face.

                               marrow
                   nell!

     luke rushes in with a blanket.  theo covers nell and then holds her,
     gently.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   look at me, nell.  look at me!

     nell manages to focus on him, her breath laboring.

                               nell
                   hugh crain.  he's in the house.  
                   he's still here...

     theo pulls back, goes very still.  the first hint of fear in her 
     eyes.

                               theo
                   no.

     marrow sees the panic working on her, gives her a stern look:

                               marrow
                   theo!  you too.  listen to me.

     the command derails theo's train of thought.  marrow stares at nell 
     in pity, can't bear it, and has to look away.  finally he turns back 
     to her, full of regret.

                               marrow
                   nell, you have to hear me.  let me 
                   explain what's happening to you.
                          (beat)
                   you're participating in a study on 
                   hysteria.

     everyone but marrow reacts.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   i've given you a powerful 
                   suggestion that you're in a 
                   haunted house.  i picked hill 
                   house because it fits the 
                   expectations.  it was my... it was 
                   my theater, my stage.

     theo glances at luke: he's been right all along.  this was never 
     about perception.

                               luke
                   modelling small-group dynamics in 
                   the formation of narrative 
                   hallucinations.  you brought us 
                   here to scare us.  insomnia, that 
                   was just a decoy issue.  you're 
                   disgusting.

                               nell
                   is this true?  i've been 
                   hypnotized?

                               marrow
                   i hadn't done a study of how group 
                   fear affects individual 
                   performance.  mass hysteria is 
                   like a story, nell.  a communal 
                   story.  someone starts it.  then 
                   we all add a little more to it.  
                   and then for some reason -- no one 
                   knows how -- we start believing 
                   it.  this story shapes what we see 
                   and hear.  we interpret everything 
                   through it, make it fit the story.  
                   i started our story when i gave 
                   you the history of hill house.  
                   you've added to it.  that's what 
                   this experiment has all been 
                   about.  that's what it was about, 
                   the experiment's over.  i'm 
                   pulling the plug.  this is my 
                   fault.

                               nell
                   it's not real?  crain?  he's not 
                   real?

     marrow shoots him a look: shut up.

                               marrow
                   your fear of him was real.  that's 
                   all the ghost anyone needs.

                               theo
                   how could you do this to people?

     nell bucks in his arms, furious, desperate.

                               nell
                   this is real, i'm not making it 
                   up!  theo, you saw it!  you were 
                   there -- the banging and last 
                   night.  you, you all saw the 
                   painting!

                               theo
                   nell, it makes sense.  it all 
                   makes sense.  you and i, we were 
                   scaring each other, working each 
                   other up.

                               nell
                   -- but the painting!

     nobody says anythlng.  the silence tortures nell.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   i know you think i did that.  i 
                   didn't!  go to the great hall and 
                   look in the fireplace!

     she starts to laugh.  marrow gently presses nell down, tucking the
     blanket around her.

                               marrow
                   why would we want to do that, 
                   nell?

                               nell
                   because that's where he burned 
                   them up, the child laborers from 
                   his mills!  because that's where 
                   their bones are!  he killed
                   hundreds.  he took them here and
                   he killed them.  their bones are 
                   in the fireplace!

     nell sobs.  the others exchange looks at this.  it sounds so hollow, 
     so delusional, it makes marrow look so right.

                               marrow
                   there are no bones in the 
                   fireplace.  luke and i looked in 
                   it yesterday.  there's some old 
                   charred wood in the ash drop
                   but --

     nell spasms trying to fight her way up, but marrow and luke hold her
     down.  nell begins to wail in helpless rage.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   nell!  if we look in that 
                   fireplace it'll just make you more 
                   upset.  and when there are no 
                   bones there, you'll say they got 
                   up and walked away.

                               nell
                   oh, god, you're not going to 
                   look...

     theo pushes them back and grabs nell's hand, gently brushes nell's
     face.

                               theo
                   aw, shhh nell, shhh.

     theo turns up to marrow, intense, furious with him.

     nell's hysterics have stopped.  she stares up at him, lost.  
     searching inside herself.  maybe she is crazy...

                               marrow
                   there has to be monster in the 
                   labyrinth.  we make them up.  
                   that's how we deal with the things 
                   in everyday life that are too 
                   terrible to deal with.  like 
                   losing someone.  like being alone.

     marrow reaches down to nell, but she shrinks away.  theo blocks 
     marrow out, shielding nell.  marrow pauses, disgusted with himself.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   i'm sorry, nell.  i'm really, 
                   really sorry i did this to you.

                               luke
                   sometimes saying you're sorry is 
                   just not enough.

     a disgusted luke leaves the room.
