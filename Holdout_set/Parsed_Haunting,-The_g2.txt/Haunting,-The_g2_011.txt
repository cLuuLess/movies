     int. marrow's office - day

     long, narrow, badly lit, it's filled with filing cabinets, stacks 
     of unread textbooks still in publisher's plastic, a desk with 
     computer.  as soon as they enter, mary looks at the phone.

                               mary
                   it's for you.

     and then the phone rings.  he doesn't pick it right up, he lets it
     ring.

                               marrow
                   you hear the vibrations in the 
                   wire.  there's a magnetic pulse in 
                   the wires, you feel it.  i could 
                   test it.

                               mary
                   test it.

     the phone still rings.  marrow answers.

                               marrow
                   yes, this is doctor marrow.

                               mary
                   how'd i know it was for you?

                               marrow
                          (quickly)
                   because it's my phone.
                          (back to the phone)
                   yes... mrs. dudley, just leave the 
                   boxes inside, thank you.  see you 
                   soon.  thank you.

     he hangs up.

     marrow is trying to read the first file as he goes to his desk.  
     mary shows him a huge corkboard covered with photos, articles, and 
     various items.

                               mary
                   here's how they're organized.  
                   groups of five, very different 
                   personalities: scored all over the 
                   kiersey temperament sorter just 
                   like you asked for.  and they all 
                   score high on the insomnia charts.

                               marrow
                   good.

     a photo of nell falls on the floor.  marrow scoops it up.  he holds 
     the photo of nell up to mary, and look at the written notes and 
     studies the graphs that go with it.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   this is correct?

                               mary
                   her mother died two months ago.  
                   she says she really wants to do 
                   this.  i didn't know if it'd be 
                   taking advantage...

     marrow considers the lonely image for a long moment and then looks 
     at the graph of her test scores.

                               marrow
                          (meaning the graph,
                           not the face)
                   what a beautiful profile.  how do 
                   you feel about her?  what does 
                   your intuition say?

     mary balks at his teasing.

                               mary
                   i put my favorites on the top.

     marrow continues to study the files.

                               marrow (oc)
                   okay... this one's good... 
                   extrovert feeler... okay... this 
                   one i like, too...

     we don't pay as much attention now to the cork board as to other
     images on the wall.  we find clinical-looking shots from stanley
     milgram's experiments: subjects appearing to scream in response to
     electrical shock.

     rows of weeping prisoners in the stanford prison experiment.

     photos of victims crushed under the stands of a soccer stadium, the
     aftermath of a riot.  a picture of the fuhrer before his mesmerized
     masses.  mary opens a large envelope.  she takes out a photograph 
     that we can't see.

                               mary
                   what's this?
                          (has to get his
                           attention)
                   what's this... this picture?

                               marrow
                   that?  that's hill house.

                               mary
                   this is where we're going?

                               marrow
                   yes.  it's perfect, isn't it?

     mary studies the picture, and she can't answer him.  in her 
     glasses, we get the thinnest reflection of the photograph, a 
     glimpse of dark brick and high chimneys.
