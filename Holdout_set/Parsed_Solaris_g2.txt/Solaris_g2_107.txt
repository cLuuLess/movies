int.  kelvin's room (prometheus)

kelvin is in his bed, still feverish.

                    kelvin (v.o.)
          i thought it was over.

he looks around the room.  he is alone.

a flashing light on his computer demands attention.

on the computer

a video message from rheya.

                    rheya
          don't blame them.  i begged them to
          do it.  it's better this way.
              (beat)
          i'm sorry.
              (beat)
          i'm sorry i tried to make you think
          i was human.
              (beat)
          i read my own suicide note.  i
          found it in your things.  i
          realized i was not her.

she looks away.

                    rheya
          i know that you loved me, chris.  i
          know that.
              (beat)
          i love you.

kelvin breaks down.
