int.  kelvin's room

kelvin, on the edge of his bed.  he wants to tear himself
inside out.

a voice calls over the intercom: snow's.

                    snow
          was her breakfast conversation that
          bad?

                    kelvin
          shut up.

                    snow
          i told you, try to stay calm. 
          you're supposed to be the
          psychologist of the bunch.

                    kelvin
          what was it?

kelvin rises and goes to wash his face.

                    snow
          personally, i think it's god.  at
          least, it fits my definition.

                    kelvin
          and professionally?

                    snow
          i'm not sure.
              (beat)
          it started with gibarian.  he
          locked himself in his room and
          refused to talk except through a
          crack in the door.  he covered the
          video lens.  obviously we thought
          he was having a nervous breakdown.
          i don't know why he didn't tell us
          he had somebody in there.  by this
          time, we were getting visitors,
          too.  he was desperately trying to
          figure it out.  day and night.
              (beat)
          who was she?

                    kelvin
          my wife.

                    snow
          dead?

kelvin nods.

                    snow
          she has materialized from your
          memory of her.  what was her name?

                    kelvin
          rheya.

                    snow
          it started about three months ago. 
          right after the government sold the
          expedition.  we were ready to go
          home.

                    kelvin
          will she come back?

                    snow
          probably.

                    kelvin
          i wish you'd told me.

                    snow
          told you what?

a beat.

                    snow
          what will you say?

                    kelvin
          to who?

                    snow
          what are you going to report back
          to earth?

                    kelvin
          i don't know.

                    snow
          an enormous amount of money changed
          hands to get control of this
          project.  we are in little danger
          of being left alone for long.
              (beat)
          you'll need to do something. 
          otherwise they'll be sending
          someone out to recover you.

                    kelvin
          gibarian said he thinks solaris
          should be destroyed.

                    snow
          that's ludicrous.  this is contact. 
          we have found god.  the only issue
          is figuring out how to prove this
          in a way that will make sense back
          on earth.  so how will we describe
          it, if we choose to describe it at
          all?

                                                  cut to:
