int.  kelvin's room

kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to snow. 
rheya is asleep in the background.  the room is dark except
for the glow of the screen.

                    snow
          you're unnerved because you've
          spent your whole life thinking
          nobody is looking over you, and
          suddenly your subconscious is an
          open book.  we are, for the first
          time, experiencing changes in
          natural reality by a force not our
          own.  that proves that --

                    kelvin
          -- we are not sure of that.  we are
          not sure we aren't all
          hallucinating.

                    snow
          if god is beyond our comprehension,
          and she --
              (meaning rheya)
          -- is here for reasons that can't
          be understood, isn't god here?

                    kelvin
          not necessarily.

                    snow
          stop equivocating!  unbelievable,
          how you equivocate!  you, the
          atheist, you're more dogmatic than
          any holy person i've ever seen! 
          this is happening, kevin.  wake up.

                    kelvin
          consciousness is enough, that's all
          i've saying.  consciousness should
          be enough for anybody.

                    snow
          who are you trying to convince?

kelvin just looks back at rheya.

                    snow
          it will end badly.  as inevitably
          as the rising of a bubble.

kelvin doesn't respond.

                    snow
          let's all meet tomorrow.  sartorius
          has some new ideas, about making it
          stop.

kelvin just keeps staring at rheya, asleep.

                                                  cut to:
