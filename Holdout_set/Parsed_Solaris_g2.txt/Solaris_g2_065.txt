int.  kelvin's room

kelvin, thinking.  he gives rheya some pills to take.  she
just looks at them.

                    kelvin
          are you going to take them?

she nods and takes them.

                    rheya
          what's happening to us?

                    kelvin
          it's all right.

                    rheya
          please don't lie.  i told you
          before, i don't know how i came to
          be here.  whatever you think you
          can't say to me, i need to hear you
          say it.

                    kelvin
          i love you.

                    rheya
          don't.  i'm the one at risk here. 
          if we're playing out what happened
          before, i won't survive.

he goes to her.

                    kelvin
          that won't happen again.  we're
          different.

                    rheya
          how can i tell?  you've seen both
          of me.  i only know what you're
          like here.  you're all i know. 
          there is no "you" from before.

she sits, frustrated.  sad.

                    rheya
          how could it be so cruel?  how
          could it torture us like this?

                    kelvin
          i don't think it knows it's
          torturing us.  it's just watching.

                                                  cut to:
