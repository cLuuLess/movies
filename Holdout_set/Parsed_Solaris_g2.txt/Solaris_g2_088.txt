          i've decided that if it is god,
          it's a sick god.  its ambitions
          exceed its powers, but it doesn't
          realize it.
              (beat)
          it's created a situation without a
          goal, and i hate that.  a god whose
          passion is not a redemption, who
          saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.
              (beat)
          and us?  we would have to have "an
          arrangement".  an unspoken
          understanding that i am not human. 
          how can i not hate something that
          does that?

                    kelvin
          please.  don't.
