int.  b deck conference room

snow and sartorius wait for kelvin.

                    snow
          he won't do it.

                    sartorius
          why do you say that?

                    snow
          he won't.

kelvin enters, with rheya.  snow and sartorius exchange
glances.

                    kelvin
          this is my wife, rheya.

she looks at snow and nods.  sartorius she hates instantly,
and the feeling seems to be mutual.

                    sartorius
          we thought you'd be alone.  we want
          to talk about...

                    snow
          we want to talk freely.

                    kelvin
          go ahead.

sartorius begins.

                    sartorius
          i suggest we pool our knowledge
          regarding the... visitors.  we can
          express whatever questions or
          conclusions we might have... share
          information about our various...
          experiments.  agreed?

kelvin and snow nod.

                    sartorius
          i would like to start with
          motivation.  why are they here?

sartorius looks at rheya.  she looks away.

                    sartorius
          they are not autonomous individuals
          and they're not actual persons. 
          they are projections materializing
          from our minds, based on a given
          individual.

                    snow
          it's an experiment.

                    kelvin
          no.  there's no behavior
          modification.

                    sartorius
          she reappeared exactly as she had
          before?

kelvin looks at rheya and nods.  she is struck by the word
"before".

                    snow
          the same vulnerabilities?

he nods again.

                    sartorius
          a recoil, with no compensating
          mechanism.

                    snow
          and when a given situation no
          longer corresponds to the normal
          faculties of the... original, the
          visitor suffers some sort of
          disconnected consciousness.

                    sartorius
          followed by non-human
          manifestations.

                    snow
          are the actions of solaris
          premeditated?

                    kelvin
          is it being deliberately cruel, you
          mean?  i don't think so.

                    snow
          i'm just trying to find an
          explanation for the continual
          reappearances.

                    kelvin
              (to rheya)
          when you cut yourself pounding the
          door, did it hurt?

                    rheya
          yes.
              (looks around)
          of course.

                    sartorius
          if they're not learning anything
          and they're not modifying their
          behavior, why do they come back?

                    snow
          it's like they're plugged into a
          game, which goes around and around,
          endlessly repeating itself.

                                                  cut to:
