int.  space capsule

close on kelvin.  we hold on him a long time, as a myriad of
readouts scroll and flash across his face.  a slit of
sunlight glides slowly through frame.

                                             dissolve to:

kelvin

in the same capsule, a month later.  he is asleep.

                                             dissolve to:

kelvin

in the same capsule, two months later.  he is dictating some
coordinates to earth.  he absently scratches his heavy growth
of beard.

                                             dissolve to:

kelvin

two months later still.  he is looking out his small,
rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to
see the approaching planet: solaris.

kelvin stares at it, hypnotized.  it has a translucent
quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating,
ocean-like surface slowly changes colors.

kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the
prometheus, edges into frame.

                    kelvin
          prometheus, this is athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?
              (beat)
          prometheus, this is athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?

no response.  he exhales and types on a keyboard.
