ext.  cabin - day

a tableau of the cabin.  the dog is on the front step,
seemingly content despite the light rain.

as fog drifts in, we rise, and soon the mist has nearly
obscured the house.  the fog turns into clouds and we get
fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and
farther away.

we stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until
gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the
corners of the frame.  still there is a light rain sound.

these dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are
forming the shape of a circle.

the misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.

and we realize we are now looking at the surface of solaris.

                                                fade out.
