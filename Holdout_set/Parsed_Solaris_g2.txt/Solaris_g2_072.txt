int.  kelvin's room

kelvin and rheya, in bed.

                    rheya
          do you think i can get pregnant
          here?

a long beat.

                    kelvin
          we'll know soon enough.

insert:

the first time kelvin and rheya spoke, at the party ten years
ago.  again we see her whisper in kelvin's ear, but this time
we hear what she is saying:

                    rheya
          i can't be a mother.

she pulls back.

                    kelvin
          that's good to know.
