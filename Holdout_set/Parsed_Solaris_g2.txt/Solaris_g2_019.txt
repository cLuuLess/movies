int.  kelvin's room

kelvin is asleep, rheya in his arms.

he wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  after a beat he
rises to sit on the edge of the bed.

a wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to
his forehead.  rheya opens her eyes.

                    kelvin
          oh, god.  i'm awake.

                    rheya
          yes.

he looks at her.

                    kelvin
          where did you come from?

she moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to
do, forever.

between kisses.

                    kelvin
          how are you here?

she stops.

                    rheya
          how do you mean?
              (beat)
          chris, what's wrong?

hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words,
perhaps) nearly causes kelvin to scream.

he stands and moves to the chair.  rheya watches him.

                    rheya
          i love you.

he looks up at her for as long as he can.  then he looks
down.

                    rheya
          do you love me?

he doesn't look up.

                    kelvin
          yes.

a beat.

                    kelvin
          i need to see snow.

                    rheya
          i'll go with you.

                    kelvin
              (rising)
          i'll just be a minute.

she bolts out of bed.

                    rheya
          don't.

                    kelvin
          why?

                    rheya
          i don't know.  i can't be alone.

                    kelvin
          i'll be right back.

she is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left
alone is palpable, even excessive.  he sees this and puts his
arms on her shoulders to comfort her.

                    kelvin
          all right.  all right.  here.

he hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water.

                    rheya
          what are they?

                    kelvin
          to calm your anxiety.

                    rheya
          to calm my anxiety.

she takes the pills and smiles.

                                                  cut to:
