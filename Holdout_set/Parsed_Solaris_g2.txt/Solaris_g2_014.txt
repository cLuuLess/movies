int.  snow's room

snow is lying on his bunk.

                    kelvin
          is there anybody else here?

                    snow
              (sits up a little)
          why, who did you see?

                    kelvin
          gibarian warned me.  he left me a
          message.

                    snow
          who was it?

                    kelvin
          she was real.  where did she come
          from?

snow looks at him but doesn't respond.

                    kelvin
          tell me.  i won't think you're
          insane.

                    snow
          oh, that's a relief.

snow lies back down.

                    kelvin
          where did she come from?

a beat.

                    snow
          how much sleep do you need?

                    kelvin
          how much sleep?

                    snow
          how long can you go without sleep?

                    kelvin
          that depends.

                    snow
          well, when you do go to sleep:
          barricade your door.

snow rolls over, away from kelvin.

                                                  cut to:
