ransacked.

kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room
where the computer terminal rests.  within moments he has
discovered gibarian has recorded a video message for him to
replay.

extremely fatigued.

          hi, chris.
              (a light smile)
          i'm so glad you came.
              (beat, the smile fades)
          i still have a little time, and i
          want to tell you something.  to
          warn you.  by now you know about
          me, or if you don't, get snow or
          sartorius to tell you; it doesn't
          matter.
              (beat)
          i didn't lose my mind.  you should
          be able to tell from this video. 
          i'm not mad.
              (beat)
          if it happens to you, remember that
          it isn't madness.
              (beat)
          you should know, i'm in favor of
          destroying solaris.  i know
          that's... illegal.  and unethical. 
          and irresponsible.  but it's the
          only way to make it stop.

a long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video,
which draws gibarian's attention offscreen.

                    gibarian
              (addressing whoever made
               the noise)
          cut that out.  do you hear me?

gibarian switches off the video.

the computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and
overlays a readout indicating the file has ended.

                                                  cut to:
