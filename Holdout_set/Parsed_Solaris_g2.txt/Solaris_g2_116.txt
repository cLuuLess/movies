ext.  street corner - day

kelvin, back on earth.  silent and still.  and the rain
continues.

he watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving
to and fro.

                    kelvin (v.o.)
          earth.
              (beat)
          what did that word mean to me?
              (beat)
          i have returned.  finally.

kelvin begins to walk.

                    kelvin (v.o.)
          i work in the city now.  after work
          i wander and lose myself.  i am
          silent and attentive.  i follow the
          current.  i make a conscious effort
          to smile, nod, stand, and perform
          the millions of gestures that
          constitute life on earth.
