ext.  cabin - day

kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel.  he looks in
as he brings his key to the lock and his face freezes.

rheya

is in the living room, waiting for him.

she is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of
the room.  sensing someone, she turns to see kelvin, and her
face melts into a smile.

kelvin

opens the door.  he cannot speak.

rheya

rises and moves toward him.

they embrace.

he breathes her in.  she squeezes him.

after a long beat:

                    kelvin
          how can you be here...

                    rheya
              (whispering)
          shhhh.  just stay with me.
              (beat)
          stay with me.  everything is
          forgiven.  everything.

she sways with him, gently.  his body relaxes.

                    kelvin
          i love you.
