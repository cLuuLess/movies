rheya is on the ground, convulsing.  beside her is a small
steel drum, which is spilling a strange-looking liquid that
solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss.

kelvin moves to rheya and is startled to see that half of her
face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire,
but merely eaten cleanly away.  he picks her up.
