int.  kelvin's room

rheya is asleep.  kelvin is talking to snow on the
videophone.

                    snow
          we can liquidate the station.  take
          the athena back.

                    kelvin
          no.

                    snow
          of course, when we return, we'll be
          regarded as lunatics if we tell the
          truth.
              (shrugs)
          we'll chalk it up to isolation,
          collective derangement.

                    kelvin
          i've never heard you express any
          desire to leave before now.  why
          now?

                    snow
          well, i think we're reaching the
          point of diminishing returns here,
          right?  certainly it's learning
          more about us than we'll ever learn
          about it.

                    kelvin
          but why is it doing what it's
          doing?  given it's resources, it
          could have done anything. 
          presented me with your double, and
          you with mine.

                    snow
          perhaps it did.

                    kelvin
          human beings can die.

                    snow
          but they are human.  they certainly
          become human with incredible speed. 
          first they're like they were in our
          memory, but then they fill in on
          their own.  dna doesn't determine
          the hundreds of trillions of
          connections that occur in the
          brain, it's not dense enough.  they
          build up with experience.
