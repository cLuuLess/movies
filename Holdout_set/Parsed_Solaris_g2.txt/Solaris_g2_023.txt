kelvin stares at gibarian's body, which is lying under a
sheet in the ship's operating room.  also under the sheet,
next to gibarian: the young girl.

              (from a video)
          i thought i'd been behaving
          normally, rationally.  but a sign
          of insanity is the inability to
          think about more than one thing. 
          so if i am consumed by the idea
          that i am insane and can't think of
          anything else, then i am insane.

          you ask questions at the end of
          your life, the sort of questions
          people who are content don't ask.
              (beat)
          maybe life just can't be solved.
