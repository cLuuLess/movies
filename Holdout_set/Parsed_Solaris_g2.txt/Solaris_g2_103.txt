kelvin moving down a crowded sidewalk, in slow motion.

                    kelvin (v.o.)
          i am home now.
              (beat)
          i try to find the rhythm of the
          world where i used to live... but i
          feel completely and continually out
          of-sync.  i am separate.  why did i
          return to earth and lie about what
          happened?  lie about having contact
          with something like solaris?  i
          knew something else was out there,
          and didn't tell a soul.  i left
          them in the dark.  we all did.
