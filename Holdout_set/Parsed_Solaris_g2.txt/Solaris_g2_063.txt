int.  kelvin's room

kelvin is asleep.  rheya is next to him.

offscreen, we hear the door open.

someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through
the frame and sits.

after a long beat, kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling
to clear.  when it does:

                    kelvin
          gibarian.

                    gibarian
          leave the light off.

a beat.  kelvin tries to get his bearings.

                    gibarian
          i wish you'd come a little sooner. 
          i might not have had to kill
          myself.

he smiles, looking at kelvin.

                    gibarian
          you think you're dreaming me, like
          you dream her.  understand
          something: i am the real gibarian. 
          just a new incarnation.

                    kelvin
          what do you want?

                    gibarian
          you're being tricked.  sartorius
          picked a fight with you to avoid
          telling you about his idea for
          getting rid of the visitors.  he's
          figured out they're made of
          subatomic particles called
          neutrinos, and he's going to create
          a negative neutrino field.  twenty
          four hours a day, until they're
          back on earth.

                    kelvin
          can it work?

                    gibarian
          it can.  ordinary matter, like
          ours?  not affected.  everything
          else, disintegrates.

kelvin registers this.

                    gibarian
          what i'm saying is: don't trust
          anyone.  find yourself a weapon of
          some sort.

                    kelvin
          i can trust rheya.

                    gibarian
          you'll end up like me.

                    kelvin
          you're not gibarian...

                    gibarian
          no?  who am i, then?

                    kelvin
          a puppet.

                    gibarian
          and you're not?  maybe you're my
          puppet.  but like all puppets, you
          think you're actually human.  it's
          the puppet's dream.  wondering if
          they're human!

gibarian smiles.

kelvin

wakes up, gulping air.  rheya, startled:

                    rheya
          what's wrong?

                    kelvin
          gibarian.  he was here.

                    rheya
          you said he was dead.

                    kelvin
          he is.  but he was here...

he moves to the chair, looking for some residue of gibarian,
some proof.  finding none:

                    kelvin
          he spoke to me.

kelvin leaves the room.  after a few beats, rheya follows.
