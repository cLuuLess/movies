          it is a mistake to become
          emotionally engaged with one of
          them.  you are being manipulated. 
          you are going around in circles to
          satisfy the curiosity of a power we
          don't understand and can't control,
          and she is the living proof that
          power exists.  if she were ugly,
          you wouldn't want her around;
          that's why she's not ugly.  she is
          a mirror that reflects part of your
          mind.  you provide the formula. 
          you can only finish where you
          started, remember that.

          they sold us out to the highest
          bidder.  they had no right to do
          that.  we should have been
          consulted.  we're not fucking
          hardware.
