int.  kelvin's room

kelvin is on the videophone to snow.

                    kelvin
          she knows everything.  she knows
          who she is.

                    snow
          she knows everything?  does she
          know she came once before and you
          put her in --

                    kelvin
          no.

a beat.

                    snow
          what do you want?

                    kelvin
          i want you to get sartorius to
          abandon his plan.

                    snow
              (feigning innocence)
          what plan?

                    kelvin
          just get him to stop.

                    snow
          what do you want to do, leave the
          station with her?

                    kelvin
          yes.

                    snow
          kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  you
          don't believe me?  let's radio that
          shuttle pod you launched -- better
          yet, let's go get it.  i've charted
          it's trajectory, only take a few
          hours...

                    kelvin
          her oxygen would have run out.

                    snow
          maybe she doesn't need any.  should
          we check?

kelvin just stares at him.

                    snow
          who are you trying to please? 
          yourself?  her?  which her, this
          one or that one.  can you face
          both?  we are in a situation that
          is beyond morality.  so: leave with
          her.  you'll see the
          transformation.

                    kelvin
          into what?

                    snow
          you'll see her die, that's all. 
          they're mortal, despite what she
          told you.  she will die.  then what
          will you do?

                    kelvin
          i love her.

                    snow
          you do, you don't.  she's willing
          to give her life, you're willing to
          give yours, it's touching and
          magnificent, anything you want but 
          -- this isn't the place for it. 
          don't you see?  no, you don't.

                                                  cut to:
