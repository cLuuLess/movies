int.  apartment - night

this is ten years ago.  rheya enters, alone.

she crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink.  almost
immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and
stands beside her, tail wagging.  she ignores it and
continues mixing her drink.

halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on.  a
moment later, kelvin is in the doorway.  eventually, but not
angrily, because he's still not really awake:

                    kelvin
          where've you been?

                    rheya
          i been thinking about how much i
          hate you.

she finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the
door.

kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and
returns to bed.  the light goes out.

                    rheya (v.o.)
          yes, i remember that.  i went back
          to lois' house and spent the night. 
          those were dark days.
