int.  flight deck

kelvin and sartorius get the ship ready for take off.

                    kelvin
          where's snow?  did you call him?

                    sartorius
          yes.

kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that snow is
sitting in his room.

                    kelvin
              (via intercom)
          snow!  we need you up here.

snow doesn't reply.

                    kelvin
          snow!

snow looks up.  there's a strange look on his face.

                    kelvin
          what's wrong with you?  we need
          your help.

                    snow
          i won't be making the trip.

                    sartorius
          snow, get up here, now.

                    snow
          i'm not snow.

this stops kelvin and sartorius.  they look at each other and
then at the monitor.

                    snow
          i got rid of him.  i wanted to see
          if... i wanted to be the only one. 
          i wanted to be snow.

                    sartorius
          fuck me.  i knew it.

                    kelvin
          when did this happen?

                    snow
          oh, right away.  that's why you
          never saw me with anyone.  you
          should've noticed that.  i miss
          him, though.  i think i made a
          mistake.

                    kelvin
          jesus...

                    snow
          but i can't leave with you.  i
          won't make it.

                    kelvin
          maybe you can.

                    sartorius
          you want it coming back with us?

                    snow
          you go ahead.  of what i remember
          about earth... it's all one thing
          now.  everything's a blur.  i like
          distinctions.

snow lies down on his bed.  kelvin looks at sartorius.

                    sartorius
          we do not have time to deal with
          this.  get the diode sail into
          position and let me know when the
          bias drive and the induction ring
          are at zero point.

kelvin nods and obeys.  he then takes one last look at the
monitor to see snow lying in bed.  kelvin reaches over and
shuts the monitor off.

                                                  cut to:
