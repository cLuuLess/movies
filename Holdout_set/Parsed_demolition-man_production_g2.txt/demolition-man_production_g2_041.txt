        int. police station - main area - day

        lenina streaks past her zombie co-workers, cool under
        fire, to spin the main computer screen to her.

                                huxley
                  access the cryo-pen's morning
                  hearing schedule... and then give
                  me... wait...

        a list of names flashes on the screen.

                                lamb
                  it's phoenix.  simon phoenix...

        a grizzled african-american veteran, zachary lamb, steps
        behind lenina, covering traumatic memories with a stoic
        shudder.  he points to phoenix's name on the hearing
        list.

                                lamb
                  i knew him.  we all knew him.  he's
                  evil like you've only read about,
                  girl.  he's...

                                huxley
                  hold that thought, zachary lamb.
                         (to computer)
                  simon phoenix's code.  now.

                                female computer (v.o.)
                  there are no specifications on
                  file for simon phoenix.

                                huxley
                  l7, you're not coming down with
                  another virus, are you? what's
                  phoenix's code!

                                lamb
                  you don't get it, lenina huxley.
                  phoenix isn't coded.  he got
                  chilled back in the 20th, before
                  they started lojacking everybody
                  ... i was a rookie then... he
                  was a big dealer.  narcotics.
                  software.  wetware.  anything.
                  declared his own kingdom in south
                  central l.a.  m.d.k.'d whatever
                  got in his way.  in a bad time,
                  he was the worst.

        garcia has punched up a camera view of a prone body in
        the parking area.

                                female computer (v.o.)
                  one stopped code in penitentiary
                  parking area.  john mostow,
                  doctor.

        the perky dispatcher has come to.  begins to sob and
        then to wail.  lenina can't concentrate.  gives the
        dispatcher's rolling chair a firm push, sends her
        drifting away across the station.

                                huxley
                  tell me, l7...
                         (dramatic pause)
                  is the doctor's conveyance still
                  in the parking zone?

                                female computer (v.o.)
                  doctor's vehicle has been code-
                  fixed at the corner of hollywood
                  and vine.

                                huxley
                  glorious.

                          his feet and taking

        the adrenaline in the control room surges.  tears are
        being wiped away.  justice is near.
