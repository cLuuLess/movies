        int. wasteland - underground street - night

        they are in the wasteland which is surprisingly busy and
        crowded.  people living in tents, lean-tos, whatever
        their ingenuity can provide.  think third world refugee
        camp underground, a souk.  marketplaces, food stalls...

        the underbelly of the city lit from above by strand after
        strand of bulbs in construction cages and other fortui-
        tously salvaged lights, revealing odd tunnels of
        indeterminate former usage, abandoned subway platforms,
        natural caverns, a cutway of fifty years of sanitary
        landfill, the striations of decades of now useful trash
        being harvested.  giant belt driven ventilation fans
        whirl in enormous airshafts overhead.

        the three move along taking in the curious but
        unfrightened glances.  more than one person recognizes
        spartan from the battle the night before.  you can feel
        the buzz work down the street.

                                spartan
                  thugs and hooligans, huh?

                                huxley
                  i had no idea... we've always been
                  told the only people down here were
                  savages, who wanted only to...

        spartan, lenina, and garcia find themselves starting to
        sniff the air.  spartan grins, while the others look
        ready to vomit.

                                garcia
                  what is that emanation?

                                spartan
                  oh, yeah, oh yeah...

        the trio drifts toward a large, square hole in the sewer
        wall in front of which a smiling old woman is smoking up
        some meat and tortillas on a makeshift grill.  other
        scraps sit in the space square behind, smoking cigarettes
        and eating on ratty armchairs between shabby travel
        posters.

                                spartan
                  thank god, a real burrito...
                  smokes.

                                huxley
                  i think i'm going to...

        salivating, spartan silences lenina by taking off her
        watch and giving it to the woman.  he snatches up a
        burrito and a cigarette.

                                old woman
                         (to garcia)
                  buenos dias, senor....

                                garcia
                  uh, no thank you...

        spartan methodically switches back and forth from eating
        and smoking like a machine.

                                spartan
                  best damn burritos i ever had.

                                huxley
                  just don't ask where the meat
                  comes from.

                                spartan
                  what do you mean?

                                huxley
                  did you see any cows down here,
                  detective?

        spartan's got one bite left.  turns to the old woman --

                                spartan
                  que esta esso carne?

                                old woman
                  esta carne de rodentia.

        beat.

                                spartan
                  rat burritos.  i'm eating a rat
                  burrito.

        spartan thinks about it.  eats the last bite.

                                spartan
                  and it was good.  damn fine salsa
                  too.

                                old woman
                  gracias, senor.

        huxley is nauseous.

                                garcia
                  oh my...

        they turn and walk on.  ignoring the very disreptuable
        looking cantina tucked into a carved out section of
        landfill.  as they go by, we push in with a seedy-
        looking patron to find --
