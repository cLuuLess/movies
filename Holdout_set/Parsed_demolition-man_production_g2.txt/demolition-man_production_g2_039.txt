        int. police station - main area - day

        a wall on the side of the station house suddenly becomes
        translucent.  a map of san angeles filling the wall.  a
        small red dot blinking in the middle.

                                female computer (v.o.)
                         (serenely;
                          meaninglessly)
                  one eight seven.  one eight seven.
                  one eight seven...

        she continues to drone on in the background as the scale
        of the map decreases over and over again zooming in on
        the cryo-prison.  the blinking red dot remains constant.
        the perky dispatcher punches 1 - 8 - 7 into a keyboard.
        examines the screen.  faints dead away.  falls from her
        chair.  the tough cop rushes over.  sees the screen.  he
        drops his juice.

                                tough cop
                  oh my, oh my, oh my...

        he's a basket case.  garcia and lenina come into the
        fray.

                                garcia
                  what's a one eight seven?

        lenina shrugs.  she has no idea.  runs to a nearby
        terminal.  punches it up.

                                huxley
                         (stunned)
                  murder-death-kill.

        punches another button.  the map is replaced with an
        image from the cryo-prison.  two dead guards.  warden
        smithers crawling painfully toward the door.  it's a
        brutal image.

                                computer (v.o.)
                  i show two stopped codes at
                  cryo-prison x23-1.
                  william smithers, warden.  severe
                  injury.  do you wish to assign a
                  medic?

        the warden stops crawling.  collapses.

                                computer (v.o.)
                  update:  specification deceased.
                  do you wish to assign a coroner?

        chief earle arrives manfully on the scene.  no idea
        what's up.

                                chief earle
                  what's the matter with all of you?

                                tough cop
                  cryo-prison, sir... three non-
                  sanctioned life terminations...
                         (ready to cry)
                  murder-death-kills.  three mdks.

        earle sinks into a chair.  cops all over the station
        are in severe, gasping trauma.
