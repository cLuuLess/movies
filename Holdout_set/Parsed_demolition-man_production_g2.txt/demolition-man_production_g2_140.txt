        ext. police station - aftermath - night

        fire drones fight the blaze.  the cab of the truck, a
        door torn off, lies askew.  it's entirely filled with
        dense, solid foam.  half a beat... it cracks open,
        spartan appears tearing giant hunks of foam away.  eyes
        wild.

        earle stands, mouth agape, staring at the destruction.
        spartan's reappearance doesn't make him feel any better.

                                earle
                  you... you... menace!

                                spartan
                  yeah.

        huxley comes running up from the gto.

                                huxley
                  john spartan, i thought your life
                  force had been prematurely
                  terminated.  look at you, you're
                  in shambles.

                                spartan
                         (still tearing off
                          foam)
                  thought i was fucked this time too.
                         (re:  his torn uniform)
                  don't worry.  i can fix this later.
                  all i need's a needle and thread.

        spartan looks around, turns to earle.

                                spartan
                  i need something, anything, a
                  shotgun, a flare gun...
                         (looks up)
                  holy shit...

        earle and huxley follow his glance.  coming across the
        green, a horde of scraps, armed to the teeth, carrying
        the dead cryocons on two litters, and emerging from
        their midst beside payne, alfredo garcia.

                                earle
                         (mustering command)
                  stun batons on!

        spartan gives him a look, are you out of your mind?
        huxley ignores him completely as well.  moves to garcia.

                                spartan
                  you get a bump on the noggin and
                  you're pancho villa.

                                garcia
                  who?

                                spartan
                  never mind.
                         (to payne)
                  loan me a gun.  loan me two guns.

        payne thinks about it for a half second.  hands his gun
        over, nods to someone else as well to follow suit.
        spartan straps on two guns and a giant ammo belt .

                                spartan
                  what else you got?

        the scraps unearth half-a-dozen large explosive devices.
        spartan loads them into the gto.  earle is ready to cry
        when he sees all this.  a catastrophe averted, but --

                                earle
                  you would have used these weapons
                  of mass destruction against the
                  men and women who upheld the law?!

                                payne
                  we would have used these weapons
                  to shop for groceries.

        half a beat.  earle gets it.  there's kids in this crowd.
        and a lot of hungry people.

                                payne
                  look, chief, i've had it with being
                  a criminal.  i'm not a criminal.
                  think of me more as the head of the
                  people's militia.  we're gonna go
                  dump the tea in the harbor, ya
                  know?

                                earle
                  that's good, cause tea contains
                  caffeine.

        spartan looks at him.

                                spartan
                  you're joking again, right?
                         (as earle nods)
                  grin or something afterwards,
                  people don't know.

        earle nods seriously.  spartan steps over to the dead
        guys on the litters, pulls back a sheet.  he stares at
        the first guy.  can't believe what he sees...

                                huxley
                  who are these swarthy strangers?

                                spartan
                         (stunned; checks the
                          second)
                  i know these guys.  i arrested them
                  years ago... albert collins, 22
                  known murders.  beppo zemoto, i
                  don't even want to talk about what
                  he did.  and they're out.  there
                  were more too...

                                huxley
                         (proud of him)
                  i once checked, prior to your
                  arrest, 45 out of 200 members of
                  the multilife sentence wing of
                  the cryoprison were your arrests.

                                spartan
                  right now, that's not a very
                  reassuring statistic...

                                katherine (o.s.)
                  hey.  dad.

        spartan turns, faces his daughter.

                                katherine
                  here.  you gave me this.

        she holds out a tarnished barely recognizable gold lapd
        shield on a chain.  drapes it over his neck.  she hugs
        him.

                                katherine
                  don't get killed.  maybe we'll
                  get to know each other.

                                spartan
                  that'd be good.

                                katherine
                  i didn't tell you i loved you.

        he smiles at her gently.  forty-two years of pain washing
        clean --

                                spartan
                  you don't have to.

        it hits her hard.  this is her dad.  spartan gets in the
        gto.  huxley gets in beside him.  looks at her.  thinks
        about it.  she'll do as a partner... fires the gto up.
        the thing's a bomb on wheels now.

                                huxley
                  don't hit anything.

                                spartan
                  whattya mean?  i'm an excellent
                  driver.

        as he goes squealing out, clipping and knocking over the
        one remaining wall of the police station --
