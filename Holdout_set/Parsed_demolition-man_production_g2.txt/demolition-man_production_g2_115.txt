        int. wasteland - culvert - night

        it forks upwards.  sixty degree incline.  flattens out.
        splits again.  spartan halts, listens.  follows the
        footsteps.  same trick works backwards, as phoenix stops
        dead, hears spartan coming.  fires the acmag.  misses as
        spartan is just about to round a bend into range.

        the culvert itself explodes, blowing shrapnel everywhere.

        fifteen feet of it are gone.  it's an ugly, ugly jump.
        two hundred feet down and no room to miss.  off to one
        side, one of the fans spins madly.  spartan leaps.  hits
        the other side, grasping at shards of metal.  pulls
        himself in.  it heads back up.

        spartan ascends.  up.  up.  now almost, and then
        completely vertical.  he climbs spread-eagled after
        simon.
