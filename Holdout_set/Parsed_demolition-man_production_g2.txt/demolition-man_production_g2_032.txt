        ext. another san angeles street - day

        huxley's police car glides by.  a beat.  in front of one
        perfect building is a small object the size and shape of
        a coffee can.  as we push in to it, we find, it's
        ticking.  we can see the escape wheel ratcheting back and
        forth.  it's very crude, very 1920's clockwork.  four
        ink-filled quadrants on a wheel inside.  the yellow
        quadrant rotates into position.

        a small sharp explosion.  like an ink jet, the yellow ink
        is flung through a nozzle against the wall in an 8 x 20
        foot swath.  the red ratchets and fires, the blue as
        well.  now we can see the graffiti bomb has screened a
        message on the wall -- "life is hell."  the black
        explodes.  little death's heads are sprinkled around the
        message.  the ink jet machine blows itself up.
        pedestrians gather and stare at the message.  mouths
        open, dumbstruck.

        two shock poles emerge from hidden panels in the side of
        the building.  a sheet of lightning flashes between
        them.  the message turns to ash and falls to the ground.
        the poles tuck back into their boxes.  a small rabbit-
        sized vacuum sweeper emerges, zings along on its own
        power and sucks up the ash.
