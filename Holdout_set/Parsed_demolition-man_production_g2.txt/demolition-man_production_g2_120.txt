        int. wasteland - underground street - night

        knocked to the ground before her burrito stand, the old
        woman points inside the square room.

        spartan comes in low, gun out, ready to fire.  no one
        there.  spartan pivots into the square space, looking all
        around.  then up.  an open trapdoor.  spartan peers in.


        elevator shaft

        a humongous steelwalled vertical shaft which rises up
        into the blackness.  the old woman's cubbyhole is really
        a huge freight elevator.  phoenix is climbing up a cable
        with speedy precision.


        burrito joint

        spartan drops down with a gleam.

                                spartan
                  there's an elevator shaft on top
                  of this place...

                                huxley
                  then does that mean this place
                  is...

        spartan looks around, tearing old travel posters off the
        wall.  reveals a panel.  large up/down handle.

                                huxley
                  going up?

                                spartan
                         (looking off; with a
                          sudden grin)
                  momentito, senorita huxley.
