        int. long tunnel - night

        the truck driver is stunned and scared as he enters the
        tunnel but gets another scare as spartan suddenly pops
        up at his door.

                                spartan
                  move over!

                                truck driver
                  oh dear!  don't hurt me, please
                  don't hurt me!

        spartan pushes the burly trucker over and climbs into
        the driver's seat.  the trucker takes one look at this
        mad man and decides his fate is safer elsewhere.  leaps
        from the truck.  lands safely in some shrubbery.  sobs.
        spartan guns the massive truck.

        phoenix thinks everything is a-okay until he looks in his
        rearview and sees a bunch of streetlights being taken out
        by the too huge truck and getting closer.  the truck
        harshly rams phoenix, nearly jarring him from his seat
        but for the restraints.
