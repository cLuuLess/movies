        ext. fortress - main yard - night

        the earth rumbles.  those who aren't thrown to the
        ground dive for cover.  the secondary explosion kicks
        in.  everything that didn't blow straight up in the air
        blows out what remains of the sides of the building.
        nothing's left standing.
