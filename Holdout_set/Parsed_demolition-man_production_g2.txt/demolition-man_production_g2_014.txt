        int. fortress - main building - second floor - night

        a wild melange of white, white light and dark, dark
        shadows.  the gas fumes ripple, refract in the air.
        lights bounce off the pools of gasoline.  spartan rolls
        into the room.  both guns come up.

                                spartan
                  simon phoenix.  you're under
                  arrest.
                         (then)
                  where are the muni passengers?

                                phoenix
                  fuck you, spartan.  they're gone.
                  i told the city no one comes down
                  here anymore.  cops figured it
                  out, postmen figured it out.  damn
                  bus drivers wouldn't listen.
                  arrest me?  you've got no
                  jurisdiction here.  you're in my
                  kingdom now.  fifty blocks in
                  every direction.  and it's mine.

                                spartan
                         (simply)
                  it's over.

                                phoenix
                  it's over?!
                         (knows it's true)
                  yeah.  it's over.  but i've been
                  king once, and i ain't ever going
                  back to jail.

        spartan keeps the guns trained on phoenix.  simon
        scratches his arm.  it's a junkie's twitch.  or is it...
        spartan can't see it, but there's a kitchen match tucked
        behind simon's ear.  phoenix reaches up to scratch
        another itch.  frees the match in one gestures, strikes
        it and tosses it into the pool of gas.  smiles.  a
        friendly happy smile.

        the room bursts into flames.  he throws back his head and
        laughs.  spartan dives on him.  tries to hurl them both
        through the window.

        but phoenix is either stronger or just far crazier and
        drugged up.  smashes the two of them into the wall
        instead.  they trade blows.  the building gets worse.
        ammo starts to explode downstairs.
