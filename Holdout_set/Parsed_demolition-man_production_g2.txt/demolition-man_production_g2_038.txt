        int. cryo-prison - day

        the conference area wall slides open, revealing simon
        phoenix, elegantly holding the warden's detached eyeball.

                                female computer (v.o.)
                  access granted, warden william
                  smithers.

        phoenix flicks the eye away and struts forward.  the wall
        shuts.

                                female computer (v.o.)
                  thank you.  and be well.

        phoenix glances at the speaker.  the future is fucking
        weird ---

                                phoenix
                  yeah?  you too.

        and he's gone...
