        int. cocteau's office - night

        spartan bursts in, gun drawn.  no one's there.  spins,
        checks everywhere.  spots a very dead raymond cocteau.
        huxley sees him a moment later.

                                huxley
                  horrors.  oh horrors.  sic
                  transit raymond cocteau.  oh, john
                  spartan, civilization as we know
                  it will come to an end.

                                spartan
                  it does that every once in a
                  while.

        the computer screen catches spartan's eye.

                                spartan
                  what's this?

                                huxley
                         (checks it out)
                  ooh.  this is bad.  very bad.
                         (as spartan looks
                          over her shoulder)
                  he's accessed the cryoprison.
                  he's about to defrost the entire
                  multilifer wing.
                         (beat)
                  most of them don't like you.

                                spartan
                  most of them didn't even like
                  their mothers.  these are bad
                  people.
                         (then)
                  how many?

                                huxley
                  eighty.

                                spartan
                         (beat; dry)
                  we have to stop that.
