        int. museum - armory room - day

        the exhibit begins with the crudest weapons, cavemen with
        clubs, stone axes, arrowheads, and moves up the ladder of
        history toward modern day --

        western colt revolvers, an old-time gangster tommy gun...
        in the middle of the room is a civil war cannon.  a stack
        of cannonballs sits next to it.

                                phoenix
                  this is the future.  where are
                  the fucking phaser guns?

        he keeps moving down the line.  past the 1940s, the
        1980s, 1990s... and finally a weapon he doesn't recognize
        at all.  magnetic accelerator gun.  acmag for short.
        phoenix grins.

        punches the glass in the exhibit.  hard.  his fist
        bounces off.  it hurts.  he looks around for something to
        break it with.  nothing.  side kicks a larger expanse of
        glass in front of another display.  almost breaks it.
        not quite.  growls.  a museum helper/guard comes into
        the room.  moves towards the annoyed phoenix smiling
        pleasantly.

                                museum guard
                  mellow greetings.  what seems to
                  be your boggle?

                                phoenix
                  my boggle...
                         (he sighs)
                  i'm at the top of the food chain,
                  ya know?  and i would prefer to
                  use tools, not bruise up my hands
                  and feet.  but i can't find
                  anything in this place.  a rock,
                  a crowbar, any heavy object.
                  tell me, whatta you weigh?

        the guard looks at him in total confusion.  phoenix grabs
        him by the lapels and shot-puts him across the room into
        the glass.  this time it shatters impressively.

                                phoenix
                  enough...

        a very mellow alarm goes off murmuring "please exit" over
        and over.  simon begins sorting through weapons
        available.  loads a shotgun from the case.  tests it by
        blowing up another display.  works just fine.  the alarm
        changes to "please exit rapidly." it begins to annoy
        him.  he blows the loudspeaker away.  blows up the acmag
        case.  grabs the gun.  there doesn't seem to be any
        cartridges.  no way to load them either.  aims, fires.
        nothing.

                                phoenix
                  motherfuck.

        there's an information booth at end of the room.
        phoenix can't help himself.  presses the ego boost button
        again.

                                museum computer (v.o.)
                  that's a great looking shirt.

        phoenix chuckles appreciatively, presses the "?" button.

                                museum computer (v.o.)
                  yes, museum patron.  have you a
                  query?

                                phoenix
                  whatsa matter with the...
                         (checks the name)
                  magnetic accelerator gun?

        graphics flicker madly on the screen.

                                museum computer (v.o.)
                  the magnetic accelerator gun, the
                  last produced handheld weapon of
                  this millenium displaced the flow
                  of neutrons through a non-linear
                  cycloid supercooled
                  electromagnetic force.

                                phoenix
                  so... what?  it needs new
                  batteries?  what size?  who sells
                  batteries in the future?  is
                  there a battery store i can go to?

        two guards appear in the doorway behind him.

                                guard #1
                         (tough-ish)
                  excuse me, museum patron...

        without a second beat, phoenix shotguns them both.  in
        the background we can hear the alarm change "run.
        run..."

        a set of steel doors whoosh down, sealing phoenix in.
        phoenix turns back to the computer as ---

                                museum computer (v.o.)
                  the acmag, now reactivated,
                  should concurrently supercool and
                  achieve fission in...two point
                  six minutes.

                                phoenix
                         (looking at steel
                          doors)
                  yeah, well, i was considering
                  leaving quickly and patience is
                  not one of my virtues.
                         (beat)
                  who am i kidding? i don't have
                  any virtues.

        laughs at his own wit.  grabs a shoulder bag from a
        vietnam era gi display.  starts loading up on weapons
        and ammo.  kid in a toy store.  examines, discards,
        chooses... and everything is free.  he turns to the
        civil war cannon.  and grins...
