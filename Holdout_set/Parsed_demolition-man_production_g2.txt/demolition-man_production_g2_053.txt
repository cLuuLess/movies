        int. police station - main area - day

        every monitor in the station blows to static.  huxley's
        fingers fly.

                                huxley
                  we've lost every camera for six
                  blocks around.
                         (thinking fast)
                  going to cahuenga at twelve
                  hundred millimeters.

        on the big screen -- cahuenga security cam pov.  when the
        zoom starts, we can't even see simon, when it ends, we
        can see him highly compressed by one of the squad cars.
        under the hood.  jamming the stun baton around.

                                garcia
                  he's going for the vehicle battery
                  core.  its capacitance gel.

                                tough cop
                  why's he doing that?

        simon finds what he's looking for.  he backs off.  the
        car explodes.  smoke everywhere.  it clears.  no simon.
        dead silence in the station.  the car still burns
        silently on the giant screen.  lenina punches it off.
