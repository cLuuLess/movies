        int. lenina's police car - moving - night

        spartan watches as the steering wheel retracts into the
        dash.  shakes his head.  everything is weird in the
        future.  then --

                                spartan
                  hey, look, i'm sorry i yelled
                  before... back there.

                                huxley
                  no need to make a dehurtful
                  retraction.  i've assimilated
                  too much contraband.  i fleshed
                  you as some blow-up-the-bad-guys-
                  with-a-happy-grin-he-man type, but
                  i realize now you're the moody-
                  troubled-past-gunslinger-who-only-
                  draws-when-he-must.

                                spartan
                  huxley.  stop.  i'm not any of
                  that... i'm nothing.

        touched, lenina hands spartan a small, unusual box.

                                huxley
                  oh, hey, here's what you asked
                  for... why do you...

                                spartan
                  thanks.  it's just a... hunch.


        lenina's apartment - night

        lenina's car whirrs up to two giant, geometric buildings.

                                spartan
                  this is where you live?

                                huxley
                  you, too.  i have procured you a
                  domicile down the corridor from
                  my own.
