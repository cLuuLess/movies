        ext. another san angeles city street / int. police
        car - day

        spartan is stuffed into the back seat of lenina's police
        car.  absently scratching the back of his hand, spartan
        stares out his window in amazement at the shiny, happy
        people in the happy shiny city.  meanwhile, lenina and
        garcia are staring through a rearview screen at spartan
        with equal amazement.

                                garcia
                  this all probably seems quasi-
                  strange to you.

                                spartan
                  quasi-strange?  this isn't my
                  city.  how do you expect me to
                  protect it?  i don't get you
                  people, let alone like you much...

                                huxley
                  you come from a society in which
                  the average l8-year-old has
                  witnessed 200,000 acts of
                  simulated violence.  in our
                  society the number is closer to
                  four.  if someone off the street
                  was to watch the three stooge men
                  and see the moe-person hammer the
                  curly-person, they would weep,
                  john spartan, weep.

        spartan looks at her.  what was that?

                                huxley
                  myself, i'm a bit of an afficanado
                  of the shocking, real and fiction.
                  in fact, i perused many a news
                  disk of you.  that time you wow-
                  fully tractor-pulled the santa
                  monica pier into a heap of rubble
                  in order to snare that team of hit
                  men who...

        she trails off, as she sees spartan staring out the
        window shaking his head, very much alienated from every-
        thing around him.

                                huxley
                  you seem very much alone, john
                  spartan.  not everything is that
                  different.  perhaps you would
                  like to hear the oldies station.
                  'oldies.'

        the radio quickly turns on and changes stations to:

                                radio (v.o.)
                  'sometimes you feel like a nut,
                    sometimes you don't.
                  almond joy's got nuts, mounds
                    don't.
                  because sometimes you feel
                    like a nut, sometimes you
                    don't.'

                                garcia
                  the most popular station in town.
                  nonstop wall-to-wall minitunes.
                  you called them commercials.  wow,
                  this is my fave...

                                radio (v.o.)
                  'fat kids, skinny kids, kids who
                    climb on rocks.
                  tough kids, sissy kids.'

        lenina and garcia join in for a sing-a-long finish as
        spartan turns back to the window, eyes bulging.  he
        goes back to scratching his hand.

                                huxley/garcia
                         (singing)
                  even kids with chicken pox love
                    hot dogs, armour hot dogs.
                  the dogs... kids... love... to
                    bite.

                                spartan
                  somebody put me back in the fridge.
