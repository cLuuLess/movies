        int. cocteau complex - conference room - day

        dr. raymond cocteau lectures at the end of a conference
        table.  we don't see who he's talking to.  he has that
        weird serenity of the obscenely-wealthy or a president-
        elect-far-life.

                                cocteau
                  the problem is not the defacement
                  of public buildings.
                         (turning to someone
                          else)
                  the problem is not the noise
                  pollution of the exploding
                  devices.
                         (turning to yet
                          another)
                  the problem is that these
                  hooligans who have left the
                  comfort of our society feel a
                  need to spew hostility at the
                  bosom they have relinquished.

        we reverse to see, instead of chairs with people in them,
        the table is surrounded by hdtv video monitors on
        swiveling mounts.  each screen has the face of a san
        angeles department head and his/her sphere of responsi-
        bility:  publicworks, orderly conduct, public dietary
        concerns, litter... twelve swiveling video heads, all
        watching and listening.

                                publicworks (image)
                  yes, indeed.

        the other video heads turn and nod in agreement.

                                cocteau
                  and mar they may, these halfdozen
                  miscreants infecting the
                  public consciousness with their
                  bile and venom.  and while i am
                  saddened, truly saddened, they
                  have left, we cannot allow them
                  to impair the harmony of san
                  angeles.  they are but vandals
                  and visigoths.
                         (then)
                  forty-four years ago when los
                  angeles exploded in violenceanger,
                  violencehatred and violencefear,
                  a disease had erupted... a disease
                  not socio-economic, but behavioral.
                  people had simply forgotten how
                  to behave... we cannot allow it
                  again.  that time, politics, law,
                  even force were useless to affect
                  change... we have triumphed over
                  all of that.
                  the same principles of b.e.,
                  behavioral engineering, i have
                  applied to cryo-prison were
                  expanded into the design and
                  execution of what we now call...
                         (gestures proudly)
                  san angeles, a city as fine as any
                  one of the holding facilities
                  i've designed.  we have a
                  peacefulsafe, and above all,
                  happyhappy population.

        the videoheads nod and mutter their approval.

                                cocteau
                  even now i am positioning actions,
                  postulating proceedings.  i expect
                  your trustconfidence and certitude.

                  as always mayor/gov raymond cocteau.

        cocteau's assistant, associate bob, comes in the room.
        gives cocteau a significant look.

                                cocteau
                         (to the videoheads)
                  if you will excuse me.

        he waves dismissively at the monitors.  the sound mutes.
        the video freezes.  bob is a large man with an oddly
        high-pitched voice and a strangely-officious manner.

                                associate bob
                  mayor/gov raymond cocteau, a
                  cryocon has effected self-release
                  from the penitentiary.
                         (shaken)
                  it is quite horrific.  murder-
                  death-kills.  all categories of
                  chaos...

        bob shudders.

                                cocteau
                  enhance your calm... enhance your
                  calm.

        cocteau gestures to the frozen video heads.

                                cocteau
                  be well them for me.  get captain
                  earle on the holo.
