        ext. cryo-prison - day

        huxley and garcia are waiting by the police car out
        front.  half a beat, john spartan, now completely done
        up in a 2042 cop uniform comes out.  he feels like a
        buffoon.

                                spartan
                  what am i supposed to be, a drum
                  major?  this isn't a cop uniform.
                  am i gonna lead the rose bowl
                  parade?  what is all this stuff?

                                huxley
                  direct biolink readouts for vitals,
                  vox radio connect, base and inter
                  officer coded by rank, partner
                  status and case priority.  and
                  that's the pocket for your whistle.

                                spartan
                         (god save me)
                  great, in case one of the floats
                  gets loose i can direct traffic.
