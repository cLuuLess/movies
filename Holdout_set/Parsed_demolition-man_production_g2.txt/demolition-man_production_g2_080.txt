        int. police station - main area - dusk

        spartan is not happy --

                                spartan
                  wait, wait, wait.

        spartan is staring at a vid screen on a wall:  cocteau,
        grinning, arms spread, his utopia behind him, and the
        behavioral engineering logo.

                                spartan
                  spacely sprockets here, who is now
                  in charge, the 'mayor/gov,' who
                  wants to take me to dinner at
                  taco bell -- though lord knows i
                  wouldn't mind a burrito -- is
                  also one of the guys who invented
                  the cryoprison?!

        morality box beeps.  spartan casually adds the paper to
        the collection in his breast pocket.  under --

                                earle
                  dr. cocteau is the most important
                  man in san angeles.  he practically
                  created our whole way of life.
                  savage!

                                spartan
                  well he can have it.
                         (choosing words)
                  and rather than inserting barbed
                  instruments up the rectums of
                  those around you, perhaps you
                  would care to sit on one yourself.

        a flustered earle gives a look to the morality box.
        spartan turns to another vid screen.  a map of san
        angeles on it.

                                spartan
                  phoenix could be anywhere, but
                  not having a code could hurt him.
                  limits his options.

                                huxley
                  correct.  money is outmoded.  all
                  transactions are through codes.

                                spartan
                  so phoenix can't buy food or a
                  place to crash for the night.
                  pointless for him to mug anybody...
                         (beat; thinks)
                  unless he rips off someone's hand.
                  let's hope he doesn't figure that
                  one out...

        everyone is momentarily nauseated.

                                garcia
                  and with all officers already
                  patrolling in a citywide crisis
                  net, it should be just a matter of
                  tick-tocks before...

                                earle
                  and you know, we already have a
                  back-up plan.  we can just wait
                  for another code to go red.  when
                  phoenix performs another
                  murderdeathkill, we'll know
                  exactly where to pounce...

                                spartan
                  oh.  great plan.

                                earle
                  thank you.

        only lenina gets the sarcasm.  she and spartan exchange a
        look.  spartan goes back to staring at the screen.

                                spartan
                  so where the fuck is he?

        spartan reaches without looking.  pockets another
        warning.
