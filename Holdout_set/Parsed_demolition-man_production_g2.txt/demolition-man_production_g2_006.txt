        int. blimp pod - night

        spartan is dragging a heavy bag up towards the door.
        pilot #2 looks at him curiously.

                                pilot #2
                  how come they call you demolition
                  man?  are you with the bomb squad?

        spartan gets his bag into position.

                                spartan
                  i just...
                         (shrugs
                          apologetically)
                  ... demolish things.

        he checks out the window.  they're not quite there.

                                spartan
                  i do my job, shit happens.
                         (to pilot #1)
                  get a thermo.

        the pilot takes a thermogram of the building in the
        middle of the compound.  we see a series of heat-outlined
        figures moving inside.

                                pilot #1
                  six.  one still, in the middle.
                  the rest moving around.  i don't
                  see any thirty people.

                                spartan
                         (checking the thermo)
                  what's that?

        to the naked eye, out the window, tucked against the
        wall of cars, a large tarp.  to the thermo, the still
        warm inner workings of the muni bus.  faint outlines of
        the engine, drive train, even seats and frame.  bingo.

        spartan takes a deep breath.  loosens up his right
        shoulder.  loosens up his left.  checks the gun on his
        right hip.  checks the gun on his left.  they both cross
        draw.  reaches down to the bag at his feet.  lapd in
        reflective letters on the side of a backpack.  spartan
        yanks some kind of rope out of it.

                                pilot #2
                  isn't that for getting people out
                  of burning buildings...

                                spartan
                  yeah, sometimes...

        slaps a carabiner onto a big eyebolt by the door.  they're
        dead center now over the complex below.  he opens the
        door.  jumps out.
