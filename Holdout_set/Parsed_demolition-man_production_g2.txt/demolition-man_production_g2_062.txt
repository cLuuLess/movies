        int. cryo-prison - conference area - day

        lenina, garcia, and earle are standing at one end of a
        long table.  gaping.  spartan sits slumped at the other
        end of the table.  draped in a grey industrial jumpsuit.
        still half comatose.

        earle is shaking his head.  he can't believe he agreed to
        this.

                                huxley
                  this is within the power of the
                  police charter, sir.  he can be
                  released on limited parole and
                  reinstated to active duty.

                                garcia
                  it's not enough to collect the
                  90's.  you have to bring them
                  back to life...

                                huxley
                  cocteau said everything in our
                  power.  i still can't think of
                  a better idea.

                                earle
                  that still doesn't mean it's a
                  good one.

        they all watch warily.  spartan comes to with a start.
        looks up at them.  looks around quickly for any immediate
        threat.  sees none.  tries to stand.  can't yet.

                                spartan
                         (pointing at garcia,
                          the nearest;
                           rasping)
                  you...

        a gulping garcia creeps to spartan.  spartan claws out,
        ripping garcia down to rasp...

                                spartan
                  where am i?

                                garcia
                  uh, i, uh...

        spartan pushes garcia away.

                                spartan
                  when am i?

                                garcia
                  uh, it's thursday.  tomorrow's
                  arbor day.
                         (beat)
                  and last week you turned eighty-
                  four years old.  happy birthday.

        huxley comes over.  clear and concisely...

                                huxley
                  detective, i'm lieutenant huxley.
                  the year is 2042.  now the reason
                  you've been released...

                                spartan
                         (shaking it off)
                  how long have i been under?

                                huxley
                  forty-four years.

        whoa...

                                spartan
                         (trying to focus)
                  i had a wife... what happened to
                  my wife?

                                huxley
                  your wife's light was extinguished
                  in the big one of 2010.
                         (off his confused
                          look)
                  uh, she died.  in an earthquake.
                  the earthquake.

        this takes a moment to sink in.  then, defrosting,
        haltingly...

                                spartan
                  my wife and i, we had a girl.  a
                  daughter.  i made a promise.
                  what...

                                earle
                  john spartan, i am chief of
                  police george earle.  we did not
                  thaw you for a family reunion.  it
                  is fortunate the lieutenant even
                  did a probe on your wife.  this
                  is about you and a mr. phoenix.
                  a mr. simon phoenix.

                                spartan
                         (fully awake)
                  what?

        huxley steps in.

                                huxley
                  this morning phoenix escaped from
                  this cryo facility.  we've had
                  nine murder death kills so far.
                  we have become a society of peace,
                  loving and understanding.  and we
                  are, quite frankly, not equipped
                  to deal with this situation.

        he looks at her like she's nuts.

                                garcia
                  there have been no deaths of
                  unnatural causes in san angeles
                  in the last sixteen years.

                                spartan
                  where???

                                huxley
                  the santa barbara, los angeles,
                  san diego metroplex merged in
                  2011.  you are in the center of
                  what used to be los angeles.

        he gets up.  he's way stiff.

                                spartan
                  great.  just great.
                         (then)
                  god, i'm so hungry.  i'd kill for
                  a burrito.

        they back off in fear.

                                spartan
                  it's just an expression.

        spartan creaks his head toward garcia, spooking him back
        away.  spartan vigorously scratches his hand as he
        speaks.

                                spartan
                  just get me some marlboros.

                                garcia
                  of course.  right away.  what
                  are...

                                spartan
                  a cigarette.
                         (relinquishes his
                          brand loyalty)
                  just get me any cigarette.

                                huxley
                  cigarettes are not good for you
                  and it has been deemed that
                  everything that is not good for
                  you is bad.  hence... illegal.
                  alcohol, caffeine, contact sports,
                  meat...

                                spartan
                  are you shittin' me?

                                morality box (v.o.)
                  john spartan, you are fined one
                  credit for a violation of verbal
                  morality statute 113.

        spartan looks at it in amazement.

                                spartan
                  what the fuck is that?

                                morality box (v.o.)
                  john spartan, you are fined one
                  credit for a violation of...

                                huxley
                         (as i was saying)
                  bad language, chocolate, gasoline,
                  uneducational toys, and anything
                  spicy.  abortion's also illegal,
                  but then again so's pregnancy if
                  you don't have a license.

                                earle
                  caveman, let us finish all the
                  rip van winkle and get moving.
                  a mr. phoenix has risen from the
                  ashes.

                                spartan
                  uh-uh.  i tracked that dirtbag
                  for two years, and when i finally
                  brought him down, they turned me
                  into an ice cube for my trouble.
                  thanks, but no thanks.

                                earle
                  the conditions of your parole
                  are full reinstatement into the
                  s.a.p.d. and immediate assignment
                  to the apprehension of simon
                  phoenix, or you can go back into
                  cryo-stasis.
                         (then; more softly)
                  not many people get a second
                  chance, john spartan.

        spartan remembers.  the freezer was bad, way bad.  he
        swallows hard and --
