        int. lenina's police car - day

        lenina holds up her new sweater with a tickled blush.
        spartan determinedly presses buttons to get the car
        humming off.

                                huxley
                  what a lovely...

                                spartan
                  i don't know what they put in my
                  cryoslush, but i thaw out and the
                  first thing i want to do is...
                  knit.  how come i know what a
                  zipper foot is, a shuttle, hook
                  and bobbin, petitpoint.  i could
                  weave a throw rug right now with
                  my eyes closed.

                                huxley
                         (chuckling)
                  it was your rehab training.  for
                  each inmate the computer draws up
                  a skill or trade which best suits
                  their genetic disposition.  it
                  implants the knowledge and desire
                  to carry out whatever training
                  was assigned.

                                spartan
                  i'm a 'seamstress?'  seamstress.
                  great.  how come i come out of
                  cryoprison and i'm betsy fucking
                  ross and phoenix comes out and he
                  can access computers, operate all
                  vehicles, find the locations of
                  every damn thing in the city?
                         (he has a thought)
                  can you get me phoenix's rehab
                  program?

        huxley punches madly away.  an access denied sign flashes
        on the screen, cutting her off.  lenina gets into a
        little more furious computer playing until she gets a
        violent beep.

        a sweet female computer voice chirps along with
        corresponding printed information.

                                sweet female computer (v.o.)
                  phoenix, simon.  rehabilitation
                  skills; urban combatkill, torture
                  methodology, computer override
                  authorization, violent...

                                spartan
                  who develops the rehab programs?
                  attila the hun?

                                huxley
                         (disquieted)
                  cocteau industries of course.
                  but why would cocteau want to
                  provoke madness?  he's always
                  been obsessed with one thing...

                                spartan
                  yeah... control.  the success of
                  his favorite restaurants.  the
                  end of kissing... i've gotta talk
                  to this asshole.

                                huxley
                  but, john spartan, you must be
                  mistaken.  you can't accuse the
                  savior of the city of being
                  connected to a multi-murder-
                  deathkiller like simon phoenix.
                  it's... rude.

                                spartan
                  i'll be subtle.  i'm good at
                  subtle.

        lenina looks anything but reassured.
