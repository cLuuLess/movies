        ext. court of stores - night

        the scrap on the motorcycle has no time to dodge as
        spartan stands his ground, jousts him clear out of
        his seat.  the motorcycle skids by, barely missing him,
        hits the curb, somersaults and explodes through the
        holograms.  spartan doesn't even flinch.

        still clutching the pole, spartan makes a swift kempo-
        swing into the three other attackers.  and then, all hell
        breaks loose.

        explosive devices explode the concrete inside nearby
        stores.  scraps come pouring out.  sewer covers are
        blown asunder followed by chain- and nunchuck-wielding
        scraps.

        an alarm screams strangely and melodically.  the food
        truck is swarmed.  inside the foodstore ten, twenty,
        thirty scraps attack and loot.  spartan sees there's a
        lot of them here.  a whole lot.

                                spartan
                  great, they brought the whole
                  team.

        three more scraps come charging out of the store.
        clutching packages.  they hurl explosive devices towards
        spartan to make their escape.
