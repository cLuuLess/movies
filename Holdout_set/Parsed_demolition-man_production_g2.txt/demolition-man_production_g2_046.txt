        the nearest cops approach with their stun batons.  simon
        kills them both.  it doesn't take long.  he breaks a
        neck, he spearhands a sternum, drives a jawbone into a
        skull.  it's all very graceful.  death ballet.

                  sarcasm?
                         (turns to two
                          terrified cops)

        they turn and run away.  simon leaps over the squad car.
        now he's in front of them.  they freeze.

                                phoenix

        catches up with the two of them.  kills them both.
        effortlessly.  just for variety uses a different style
        of martial arts this time.  two more are left.  they're
        frozen.  deer in the headlights.
