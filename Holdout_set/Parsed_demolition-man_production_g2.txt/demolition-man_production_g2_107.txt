        int. cocteau complex - conference room - day

        cocteau appears on a dozen swiveling videoheads.

                                cocteau
                         (condescending)
                  mellow apologies for my lack of
                  physical disposition, detective,
                  but i do have an entire city/gov
                  to run.

        spartan wastes no time with pleasantries.

                                spartan
                  run this.  you programmed
                  phoenix's rehab to turn him into
                  a terrorist.  now that you wussed
                  out this entire society in a
                  tribute to yourself you needed
                  phoenix to handle the cast-offs
                  who wouldn't listen to your
                  bullshit.

        huxley cringes.  the morality box beeps.  cocteau stares
        at him with that weird hypnotic serenity.

                                cocteau
                  phoenix's rehab.  now.

        half the screens scroll into phoenix's rehab file.  this
        time completely innocuous:

                                sweet female computer (v.o.)
                  phoenix, simon.  rehabilitation
                  skills; decorative gardening,
                  retail floral arrangements...

                                cocteau
                  what are you speaking of, detective?
                  my only interest in simon phoenix
                  was in that of the creation of an
                  expert florist.

                                spartan
                  florist?  phoenix wouldn't know a
                  prickly pear from a pair of pricks.

        spartan yanks out the beretta.  associate bob backs
        away while glancing furtively at a closed door.  blam.
        blam.  blam.  shoots out three of the screens.

                                spartan
                  try again.

        even on video, cocteau flinches visibly.

                                spartan
                  outside the museum, why didn't he
                  blow your brains out?  i saw the
                  security disc.  phoenix had a
                  full ten seconds to think about
                  where to put the hole in your
                  head.

                                cocteau
                         (a little shook)
                  john spartan, this display of
                  barbaric behavior was not
                  acceptable even in your time.

                                spartan
                  yeah.  but it worked.

        blam.  blam.  blam.  shoots out three more.  associate
        bob faints dead away.

                                spartan
                  when a man like phoenix has a
                  gun to your head, ten seconds
                  is nine and a half seconds longer
                  than you live.

                                cocteau
                         (on the vid screen)
                  not everyone is as eager as you
                  to resort to violence to solve
                  all the difficulties in life.
                  even now i am beginning to wonder
                  if the fracas in the museum was
                  the result of mr. phoenix's
                  presence or your own.

        the beretta appears next to cocteau's head onscreen.

                                                   cut to:
