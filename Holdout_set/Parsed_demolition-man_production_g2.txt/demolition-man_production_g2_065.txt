        int. police station - main area - day

        emotions are still a little frayed at the station, but a
        certain peace has returned.  lenina approaches the tough-
        looking cop.  they again exchange nontouching circular
        hand spins.

                                huxley
                  new inforama on simon phoenix?

                                tough cop
                  none... so where is john spartan?

                                garcia
                  he went to the bathroom... i guess
                  he got all thawed out.

        spartan trudges through a spooked gantlet of 2042
        officers.  the tough cop greets him, raising his hand.

                                tough cop
                  sir, i formally convey my presence.

                                spartan
                  hi.

        spartan reaches out and shakes the tough cop's hand.
        it's like he spit on him.  the tough cop tries not to
        react, but he's clearly disgusted.

                                huxley
                  we're not used to physical contact
                  greetings.

                                spartan
                  oh... hey, you guys are out of
                  toilet paper...

                                garcia
                  toilet paper?

                                huxley
                         (suppressed giggle)
                  they used handfuls of wadded
                  paper, back in the 20th.

        the entire station roars with laughter.  spartan stands
        unamused.

                                spartan
                  i'm happy you're happy but in the
                  place where you're supposed to
                  have toilet paper, you have a
                  little shelf with three seashells
                  on it.

                                perky dispatcher
                         (hysterical)
                  he doesn't know how to use the
                  three seashells!

        the station roars again.  spartan shakes his head and
        scratches his hand.  suddenly, the elderly lamb comes
        into view.  spartan's mouth falls open.

                                spartan
                  zach lamb, what happened to you?!

                                lamb
                  i got old.  it happens.

                                spartan
                         (stopping, smiling)
                  motherfuck.  you were a snotnosed
                  punkass rook!  look at you.
                  you're fucking old!

        the nearest morality box dutifully buzzes.

                                morality box (v.o.)
                  john spartan, you are fined three
                  credits for a violation...

        three sheets of paper come off.  spartan looks at it.
        grins.  walks over to the machine --

                                spartan
                  shit, fuck, piss, crap, damn,
                  bitch, bitch, damn.  fuck.

        a whole sheaf of paper peels off.  spartan gathers it up.
        it wads nicely.

                                spartan
                  so much for the three seashells.
                  i'll be right back.
