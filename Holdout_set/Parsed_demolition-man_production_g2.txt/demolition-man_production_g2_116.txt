        int. wasteland - cross pipe - night

        the pipe "t"s at the top.  spartan mantles up as phoenix
        clatters off.  down below in the pipe, the sound of
        someone else following as well.  a gasketed porthole
        glints beside spartan, he slams it open.  looking down,
        he is a hundred yards above the cavern floor.  beside
        him the chain arcing up from the machine shop below
        ratchets around a joint and heads off into the darkness
        in the direction phoenix has fled.

        half a beat.  spartan reaches out, way out, and just
        manages to snag the chain.  hauls madly.  chain clatters
        and clatters.  half a beat.  a long, low rumble.
        phoenix stops a moment, wondering what the hell it is.  a
        giant blast of water tidals through the pipe.  the acmag
        is swept away.

        spartan looks up to see phoenix and a wall of water
        headed his way.

                                spartan
                  oh shit.

        simon smashes into him.  the two are swept along.  the
        force blows them off the side.

                                phoenix
                  just go with the flow, spartan.
