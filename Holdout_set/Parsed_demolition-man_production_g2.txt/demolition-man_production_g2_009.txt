        int. fortress - main building - third floor - night

        stacked with armaments and stolen goods.  m70's straight
        outta the national guard armory.  crates of ammo.  stacks
        of looted sony holosets still in the boxes.

        spartan makes his way carefully along.  ready.  spins at
        a sound.  nothing there.  spartan crouches low.  slips
        around the crates.  at the far end, a very large guard
        is doing just the same thing to peer at where spartan
        just was.

        spartan launches himself at the guard.  hammers his head
        against the floor.  this guy is not getting up again for
        a long time.  spartan spins at a sound.  another equally
        large guard dives on spartan from behind.  he never makes
        contact.  spartan uses his momentum to fling him past and
        into the wall.  this guy isn't getting up again in the
        near future either.  now the room is clear.  moves
        towards the stairs.
