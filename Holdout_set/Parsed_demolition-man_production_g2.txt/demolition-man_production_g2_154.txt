        ext. cryo prison - night

        outside the building, but still inside the gate.  spartan
        pauses, still holding the flaming mtl, thinks about it a
        sec, torches the rest of the whole evil fucking place.


        gate

        as spartan steps through, the mtl sputters to a halt.
        he tosses it aside.  the cryo prison burns, explodes,
        freezes, contracts, expands behind him.

        a far greater crowd has gathered.  police, citizens,
        scraps.  they watch in silent awe and shock as spartan
        re-emerges.  katherine walks up.  deadpan as her
        father --

                                katherine
                  good to see you again, dad.
                         (kisses him on
                          the cheek)
                  come by sometime for dinner.
                         (re:  the
                          destruction)
                  i'll cook.

        he kisses her back on the cheek.  she smiles, they
        hug.  lenina watches from nearby.

                                huxley
                  that was it?  that's the whole
                  kissing thing?  what was cocteau
                  so worried about?

        spartan grabs her.  lays a real kiss on her.  long and
        hard.  she comes up for air, gasping, eyes shiny.

                                huxley
                  oh.  my.
                         (then)
                  is the rest of fluid transfer
                  activities like this?

                                spartan
                         (beat; dry)
                  better.

                                huxley
                         (beat)
                  better??!  oh.  my.

        she kisses him.  long and hard.  breaks.

                                huxley
                  welcome to the future, john
                  spartan.  now that you've
                  destroyed everything.

        he throws an arm over her shoulder.  they turn and walk
        away.  they head off into the sunrise...

                                spartan
                  yeah, i think i'm gonna like it
                  here.
                         (a beat; then)
                  there's one thing i want to
                  know though.  how does that
                  damn three seashells thing
                  work?

        and as the music comes up and obscures her explanation
        we --

                                                   fade out.
