        ext. some other san angeles street - night

        the gto crushes a computer kiosk as it roars onto the
        street, aggressively plowing through the gentle user-
        friendly cars on the road in its terrifying pursuit of
        phoenix and lamb's stolen police car.

        spartan fires out the window at the wildly fishtailing
        phoenix, but the angle's just wrong.  can't see and
        drive and aim.

                                spartan
                  fuck it.

        pulls the gun back in.  one hand on the wheel, spartan
        straight-arms the beretta and aims through his own wind-
        shield.  it's like a video game.  phoenix's fishtailing
        brings him into the sights.  spartan fires.  his own
        windshield shatters.  blows into glass pebbles all
        around them.
