        ext. court of stores - night

        the hurled scrap stumbles out of the window wreckage,
        falling to his knees.  as spartan considers what the hell
        is really going on, and should he deck this guy, a bunch
        of cans of quirky food cascade out of the scrap's jacket.

                                hurled scrap
                         (genuine pleading)
                  please... don't...

        spartan stops.  backs away.  watches oddly as the scrap
        escapes.  he lets them go.  steps back away as the others
        escape.  they don't know why he changed his mind, but
        they're not staying around to find out.

        huxley and the restaurant patrons rush up to give him a
        blast of adulation.  spartan's attention stays on the
        fleeing scraps.

                                huxley
                  such a reckless abandonment!
                  looks like there's a new shepherd
                  in town!

                                spartan
                  'sheriff'... who were those guys?

                                cocteau
                  we call them scraps.  voluntary
                  outcasts, they cower beneath us
                  in sewers, abandoned tunnels...

                                associate bob
                  they're nothing but thugs and
                  hooligans.

        cocteau nods appreciatively; bob is echoing some previous
        statement of his.  in the b.g., a team of uniformed
        engineers are patching up a hole in the ground using a
        set of steel planks, laser welders, giant cement spurting
        pastry bags...

                                huxley
                         (to spartan)
                  you are even better live than on
                  laserdisc.  oh, and the joyjoy
                  way you paused to make a glib
                  witticism before doing battle with
                  that strangely-weaponed scrap it
                  was so, so...

                                spartan
                         (losing it)
                  hey, this isn't the wild west.
                  the wild west wasn't even the wild
                  west.  hurting people is not a
                  good time.  well, sometimes it
                  is... but not when it's just a
                  bunch of guys who want something
                  to eat.  you know, i think i
                  liked it better when we were all
                  supposed to fry in a nuclear
                  holocaust.

        cocteau doesn't look pleased about any of this.  spartan
        storms off.  lenina, letting out a shocked breath, gulps
        and follows after him.
