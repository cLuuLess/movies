        int. taco bell - cocteau's table - night

        the mariachi band launches into the mexican hat dance
        song as spartan and lenina, carrying their trays, are
        escorted by a maitre d' to a table set in a secluded
        section of the restaurant.  cocteau and associate bob
        wait for them.  cocteau stands --

                                cocteau
                  john spartan, the hero of the
                  hour.  i congratulate you.

                                associate bob
                  greetings and salutations, i am
                  associate bob.  we met before,
                  ever so briefly but i was
                  groveling in fear in the humus at
                  the time.  you have had quite the
                  exciting first day in san angeles.
                  imagine, chasing a real criminal.

                                spartan
                         (sitting)
                  imagine.  could someone pass the
                  salt?

                                huxley
                         (whispering)
                  salt is not good for you.  hence
                  it is...

        spartan glares her quiet, pokes at his "burrito supreme."
        a beat.  cocteau muses --

                                cocteau
                  so, john spartan, tell me, what
                  do you think of san angeles, 2042?

                                spartan
                  i guess, considering the way
                  things were going when i went
                  in -- i thought the future would
                  be a sick, decaying pit of
                  suffering and hate with a thick,
                  foul stench.

        cocteau gloats.

                                cocteau
                  you should consider visiting new
                  york/jersey after this.

                                spartan
                         (brightening)
                  you mean nothing's changed?

        associate bob roars in appreciative empty laughter.
        think ed mcmahon.  spartan looks at him.  it wasn't
        funny.  pokes at his burrito.  ugh...

                                cocteau
                  look at you, john spartan, pouting
                  for the old cheeseburger -- the
                  flesh of dying animals covered
                  with cholesterol laden butterfat.
                  you miss the bad old days.

                                spartan
                  yeah, maybe.
                         (then)
                  look, i like vegetables.  i even
                  ate tofu a couple times.  but i
                  got to choose when i wanted it.

                                cocteau
                  you think we've gone too far?  you
                  weren't here for the fourth and
                  fifth riots.
                         (harsh)
                  civilization tried to destroy
                  itself.  people just wanted the
                  madness over.  and when i saw
                  the chance to make things right,
                  i grabbed it.  san angeles would
                  not be here.  it would be your
                  pit of stench.

                                spartan
                  yeah?  maybe you can book me a
                  flight to new york when this is
                  done.

        lenina's shocked.  cocteau's not thrilled with his
        attitude either.

                                cocteau
                  for your crimes, john spartan,
                  you would have surely rotted and
                  died in jail by now.  even you
                  have to appreciate the
                  persuasively tranquil humanity of
                  the cryo-prison system...

                                spartan
                  i don't want to piss on your
                  parade, pal, but my 'cryo-
                  sentence' wasn't a sweet lullaby.
                  i had feelings -- i had
                  thoughts -- a 44 year-old bad
                  dream about thirty people in a
                  burning building -- about my wife,
                  beating her fists against an ice
                  bucket.  it woulda been more
                  humane to stake me down and leave
                  me to the crows.

                                huxley
                  you were awake?  a person would go
                  insane.

        spartan stares out the window.  across the street he sees
        a scragly scrap on a sputtery patched together motor bike
        in front of a large food store across the street.

                                cocteau
                  i am saddened and stunned.  if
                  there's anything i can do...

        spartan goes back to staring out the window.  two, three,
        then four scraps loitering, looking around, they've done
        nothing yet, but to spartan's eye it's clear they're up
        to no good.

        the food truck approaches.

                                spartan
                         (standing)
                  just call for back-up.  i'll be
                  across the street.

                                huxley
                  but, john spartan, why... how,
                  wha...

                                spartan
                         (calling out; as he
                          leaves)
                  one of those hunch things again.
                  bad guys about to do bad things...

        and spartan is gone...
