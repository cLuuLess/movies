        int. wasteland - ominous tunnel - dusk

        spartan, lenina, and garcia all carry lightwands and stun
        batons, treading forward through a wide sewer tunnel.
        wind whistles by.  a beat, then garcia nervously sings...

                                garcia
                  'my dog's better than your dog.
                  my dog's better than yours...
                  my dog's better cause he...'
                         (to spartan)
                  sorry, when i'm nervous, i...
                  sorry.
