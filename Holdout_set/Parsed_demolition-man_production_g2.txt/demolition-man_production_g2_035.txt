        int. police station - main area - day

        a pair of frosted doors reading s.a. and p.d. slide open
        to the presence of lenina huxley.  she enters into a
        police station not of typically bustling pandemonium, but
        shocking, softly lit tranquility.  multi-ethnic officers
        of all shapes and sizes murmur about, monitoring screens
        with the casualness of the staff at a new age bookstore.
        no rush, no worries... lenina strides past an impossible
        perky dispatcher chirping into a high tech headset.

                                perky dispatcher
                  greetings and salutations,
                  welcome to the emergency line of
                  the san angeles police
                  department.  how are you?

        a tough looking cop, sipping a vibrant green juice,
        sidles up to lenina.  they exchange a non-touching
        "handshake" that has them each making a circle with
        their open palms.

                                huxley
                  let me guess, all is serene.

                                tough cop
                         (with true shock)
                  there was a defacement of public
                  buildings.  walls smudged.

                                huxley
                         (shocked as well)
                  really?  brutal.  why wasn't an
                  all cars notified?

        she's cut off by her by-the-book superior, chief george
        earle.

                                chief earle
                  because there was no need to
                  create widespread panic.
                         (then)
                  lieutenant huxley, i monitored
                  your disheartening and distressing
                  comments to the warden this
                  morning.  do you actually long
                  for chaos and disharmony?  your
                  fascination with the vulgar
                  twentieth century seems to be
                  affecting your better judgement.
                  you realize you're setting a bad
                  example for other officers and
                  sworn personnel...

                                huxley
                  thank you for the attitude
                  readjustment, chief earle.  info
                  assimilated.

        lenina turns and walks through her open office door,
        making a face out of sight and ---
