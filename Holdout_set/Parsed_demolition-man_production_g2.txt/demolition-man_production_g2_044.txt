        ext. hollywood and vine - day

        another squad car pulls up behind.  two more cops emerge.
        phoenix looks casually at the six of them.  the police
        move forward, blue sparks now spitting from their
        electrified batons.  the squad leader glances down to a
        hand-held strategic apprehension computer.

                                squad leader
                  maniac is imminent.  request
                  advice.

                                strategic apprehension computer (v.o.)
                  with a firm tone of voice, demand
                  maniac lie down with hands behind
                  back.

                                squad leader
                  simon phoenix, lie down and put
                  your hands behind your back.

        phoenix lets off a laugh.

                                phoenix
                  geez gosh.  six of you.  in such
                  tidy uniforms.  i'm so scared.

        the cops look puzzled.

                                phoenix
                  don't they have irony anymore?

        phoenix turns back to the terminal.  his fingers fly.

                                squad leader
                         (hurt)
                  maniac scoffs at us.

                                s.a.c. (v.o.)
                  approach, and in an even firmer
                  tone of voice...

        phoenix finishes a final keystroke.  the graffiti remov-
        ing shock poles burst from the building beside them.
        fires.  electrocutes and cooks one of the cops.
