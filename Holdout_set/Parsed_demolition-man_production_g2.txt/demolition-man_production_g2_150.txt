        int. cryo prison - outer thawing room - night

        med techs scramble furiously.  phoenix grabs the glowing
        compuclipboard from bob.

                                phoenix
                  so, who's left that's good?
                  ooooh, ramon gutieriz?  we
                  gotta get him.

        he's like a kid at fao schwartz.

                                phoenix
                  come on...

        simon jumps onto one of the cranes with a six clawed
        arm.  stands at the controls.

                                phoenix
                  go...

        it does.  moves too.  bob has to trot to keep up.
