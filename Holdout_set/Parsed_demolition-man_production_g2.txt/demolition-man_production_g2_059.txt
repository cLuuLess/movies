        int. police station - lenina's office - day

        garcia, earle, and lamb are huddled before lenina's
        console.


        on screen

        shot after shot of spartan emerging from the wreckage of
        destroyed buildings dragging his prisoners behind him.
        everytime:  wreckage, spartan, prisoner.  wreckage,
        spartan, prisoner.

                                garcia
                  are you sure this is real life?

                                huxley
                  barely.  spartan's a legend.  i
                  did an historical study on him
                  last year, which i guess none of
                  you swallowed.  one thousand arrests
                  in three years.  all real criminals.

                                lamb
                  there was a lot more business
                  back then.


        more wreckage

        this time spartan is marching away from a flaming, over-
        turned police car, carrying a young girl.  a tv camera
        crew scrambles up.

                  how do you reconcile the fact you
                  destroyed a three million dollar
                  mini-mall to rescue a girl whose
                  ransom was only 10,000...

                  fuck you, lady!

                                spartan (image)
                  good answer.

        smiles at the screen --

                                earle
                  this is a recommendation?  your
                  'demolition man's' an animal, a
                  muscle-bound grotesque who...

                                huxley
                  he is clearly the man for such a
                  job as this.  you could reinstate
                  him.  he hasn't worn a shield in
                  over forty years.  or much else,
                  for that matter.

                                garcia
                  he must be seventy years old by
                  now.

        a smile slowly unfolds on her face.  lamb knows where
        she's going as we...
