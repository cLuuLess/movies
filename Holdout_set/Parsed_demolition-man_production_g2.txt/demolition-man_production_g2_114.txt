        int. wasteland - large cavern - night

        spartan, huxley and garcia step in.  a meeting place
        of sorts.  a machine shop.  off to one side, a giant
        belt driven machine shop out of 1900, taking its power
        from a water wheel, attached to an enormous transmission
        spinning furiously.  mechanics fix and combine various
        vehicles into working fashion.  blow torches, bellows.
        another flume feeds a wildly churning wheel running the
        fans.

        we can see stalls and houses around the rim.  out of date
        cars are being used as homes.  spartan takes it all in.
        his eye catches a bright red 1969 pontiac gto beside the
        machine shop.  he's drawn to it in admiration, huxley and
        garcia in his wake.

                                spartan
                  nice... a 1969 pontiac lemans gto
                  convertible with rear spoiler and
                  hot wheel mags... seriously beyond
                  the standard package.

        a very large caliber revolver appears alongside spartan's
        head.

                                voice (o.s.)
                  so are these.  why don't you put
                  down the glow rods.

        spartan does.  the man with the gun is payne.  six other
        scrap toughs have the drop on lenina and garcia with
        giant crude shotguns.  one of them wears a familiar
        periscope around his neck.

                                payne
                  your friends too.
                         (they do)
                  you got ball balls, cop, coming down
                  here after the show you put on...

                                huxley
                         (tough as she can)
                  we're looking for a murderdeath
                  killer... can you help?  or just
                  bully us with these primitive
                  weapons?

        spartan shakes his head in disbelief.  payne shifts his
        aim.  fires.  blows a hole in the side of an abandoned
        car the size of a grapefruit.

                                spartan
                  well, maybe they're not so
                  primitive.

                                payne
                  not funny, not smart.  what do
                  you want, cop?

                                spartan
                  i got a few questions.

        payne cocks his pistol, aims at spartan.

                                spartan
                  but if it's a bad time we could
                  come back later.

                                payne
                  it's always a bad time down here
                  for questions.

                                tough scrap
                  you've got no business down here.

                                spartan
                  who are all you people?  and why
                  are you down here?

                                payne
                  what's it to you?  what the hell
                  do you care?

                                spartan
                  look, i'm not from here.  well, i
                  am from here, but i'm not from
                  now.  and for all i can see, this
                  whole place is as fucked up as
                  where i'm from... i'd just kinda
                  like to know what's going on.

        spartan still waits.  a crowd begins to grow.  payne,
        despite the fact that he's the guy with the gun, decides
        to answer.

                                payne
                  some of us didn't tow the line.
                  some of us didn't make the grade.

        spartan stares past payne to wild pieces of graffiti on
        a wall behind him that includes "i hate san angeles and
        suck my cocteau!"

                                payne
                  and some of us just got tired of
                  being told what to do...

                                spartan
                  guess you people weren't part of
                  the cocteau plan.

                                payne
                  man, this is the cocteau plan.

                                spartan
                  next time you go shopping, i'm
                  not going to be in your way...
                         (then)
                  listen, when the laws are wrong,
                  men have to take it upon
                  themselves to change them.

        payne stares at him.  spartan's sincere.  payne lets his
        gun drop.  the others follow.

                                huxley
                         (shocked)
                  john spartan, you must uphold the
                  law.

        a good-looking woman of about fifty looks up from the
        edge of the crowd with sudden interest at the mention of
        spartan's name.

                                spartan
                  it's the old story, give up a
                  little freedom for a little
                  safety and soon you have no
                  freedom and no safety.

                                payne
                  you're a pretty wise man.

                                spartan
                  nah, i'm just fifty years out of
                  date.  but i do have another
                  question.
                         (off payne's tacit
                          approval)
                  we're looking for a guy.  black
                  skin, white hair, one blue eye,
                  bad attitude.  he's from my time,
                  and if i don't find him, we're
                  all in trouble.

        payne hasn't.  looks to the others.

                                tough scrap
                         (nods to payne)
                  scoped him yesterday.

                                garcia
                         (amazed)
                  you were right...


        view from distance

        suddenly, the viewer is pulled out for a long view of
        spartan talking to payne.  then one, two, three, four,
        five, six bodies step into the f.g.  simon and his goons
        walking down the street.


        simon

        can't believe his good luck.  he chuckles.

                                phoenix
                  you know, i musta done something
                  right in a previous life.
                         (thinks; this seems
                          really unlikely)
                  don't know what that coulda been...

        he turns and quietly starts dispensing instructions to
        the cryocons.


        back to scene

        the woman who looked up with such interest, steps over
        closer.  she's got to know.

                                katherine
                  john spartan?  the demolition man?

                                spartan
                  yeah...
                         (surprised; looks at
                          this older woman)
                  do i know you?

        she's shaken, a tear rolls down her cheek.  she brushes
        it away.  doesn't know how to react... neither does he
        as --

                                katherine
                  you did.  i'm your daughter.

        he wraps his arms around her, she him as well.

                                spartan
                  katie, my little katie...

                                katherine
                  little kate, i'm older than you...

                                spartan
                  you'll always be my little girl,
                  i don't care how old you are.
                         (steps back)
                  god, katie.  you're all grown up.
                  i missed your whole life.  i
                  missed everything.

                                katherine
                  mom and i always talked about
                  you.  i always hoped i would see
                  you one day.  i knew i would.

        he holds her at arm's length admiring her.  then ---

                                spartan
                  tell me everything.  i want to
                  know everything about you...

                                katherine
                         (laughing; it's fifty
                          years)
                  everything?  all at once?

        spartan's grin, though it seems impossible, gets wider.
        he kisses her on the forehead.  holds her back out at
        arm's length, just looking at her with this great big
        smile...

                                spartan
                  yes.  absolutely everything.
                  start where i left off.  you were
                  six...

                                garcia
                  spartan.

        spartan's busy.

                                garcia
                  spartan...
                         (as spartan ignores
                          him; still busy)
                  spar...

                                spartan
                  what!

        garcia can only point:  simon phoenix, forty feet away,
        giant grin, acmag in hand, taking aim.

        spartan hurls katherine to the ground, with himself as a
        shield as ---

                                spartan
                  get down!!!

        huxley, garcia, and the scraps who have a clue dive as
        the acmag fires with the resulting tremendous explosion.

                                phoenix
                  spartan, buddy, i brought some
                  old friends.

        the cryocons open up with all manner of weaponry on the
        crowd.  mayhem and slaughter.  huxley and garcia have
        taken cover as well.  their stun batons look exceedingly
        useless.  spartan is momentarily trapped under a
        collapsed beam.  doesn't last long.  growls.  hurls it
        aside.  comes up firing with the beretta.

                                spartan
                  stay down!

        phoenix fires again.  the acmag round barely misses them.
        spartan's blasted brutally by the explosion.  stays on his
        feet.  keeps firing.  albert goes down.  he's not going
        to get back up again.  payne rises to his feet firing a
        giant revolver.  the other armed scraps follow his lead.
        another acmag round goes off.  the lights dim.  spartan
        sprints for where he last saw phoenix.

        spartan can hear phoenix clattering off up a culvert
        behind him.  he bolts up after him.
