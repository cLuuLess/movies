        int. 2042 gm dealership - night

        shoppers wander about admiring the cars.  half a beat.
        the elevator can be heard screeching upward.  and then a
        crunching stop.  the floor begins to buckle.  customers
        flee in terror.  the vroom of an engine can be heard.
        the floor cracks asunder.  the freight elevator emerges.
        a 2042 model is tossed aside as the elevator rises from
        the floor.

        the wasteland pontiac gto convertible is jamparked in
        burrito joint crunching the place's chairs in a heap.
        driver spartan revs the engine as passenger lenina
        shudders about what is to happen next.

                                huxley
                  now what?

                                spartan
                  vaya con dios.

        spartan drops the gto into gear.  roars the car straight
        out the front window of the dealership.
