        int. cocteau's office - night

        dark.  cocteau steps in.  trailed by associate bob.
        nothing happens.  he looks around wondering why.

                                cocteau
                         (a little annoyed)
                  lights.

                                phoenix (o.s.)
                  nah, i changed that.  illuminate.

        the lights go on.  simon is behind cocteau's desk, his feet
        up.

                                phoenix
                  illuminate.
                         (they go off)
                  isn't that nicer?  go 'head, you
                  try it.

                                cocteau
                         (exasperated)
                  illuminate.

        the lights come back on.

                                phoenix
                  raymond, bud, we need to talk.

                                cocteau
                  how'd you get in?

                                phoenix
                  i wish i knew.  access codes,
                  routes to secret underground
                  kingdoms, the words to songs i
                  thought i forgot... i've been
                  meaning to ask you about this.  i
                  can do almost anything.  i like
                  this.  a lot.

                                cocteau
                         (starting to lose his
                          calm demeanor)
                  your skills were given to you for
                  a reason.  not for your personal
                  amusement.  your job is to kill
                  this nuisance, thomas payne no
                  one else in san angeles can
                  perform this simple task
                  anymore -- and not to allow him to
                  wreak any more surface harassing
                  havoc.  and your ineptitude
                  allowed it to grow worse tonight.

                                phoenix
                         (beat)
                  'ineptitude.'  now i'd say that's
                  a bit of a provocative word,
                  raymond.  have you ever been down
                  to the wasteland?  has anyone you
                  know been down there??  no?
                         (good; then i lie madly)
                  oooh.  it's bad down there.  really
                  bad.  it's a wonder i got out of
                  there alive.  it's gonna be a big
                  problem.
                         (sorry, but...)
                  i'm gonna need five or six more
                  guys.  easy.
                         (then)
                  you gotta list?  'cause i don't
                  wanna defrost no serial killers
                  or mad dog types.

                                cocteau
                  so you're gonna be the only mad
                  dog type?

        for a minute we might think phoenix is insulted.  uh uh.

                                phoenix
                  exactemundo.

        cocteau turns to bob.

                                cocteau
                  fine.  take care of it.
                         (then to phoenix)
                  just get it over with... you're
                  beginning to be more trouble
                  than you're worth.

                                phoenix
                  aww, don't say that...

        phoenix chuckles.  then, a little irked --

                                phoenix
                  what the hell is spartan doing
                  here, raymond?  who invited him to
                  our party?

        cocteau's gotta lie about this one.  wasn't part of his
        plan either.

                                cocteau
                  finish your business and i'll
                  stuff him back in the freezer.
                  think of him as a guarantee.

                                phoenix
                  i took care of spartan before,
                  don't worry your pointy little
                  head about it.  now to avoid this
                  ineptitude, we need these guys
                  thawed...

        cocteau nods.  yeah, whatever...

                                phoenix
                  illuminate.

        the lights go out again.  simon chuckles madly.

                                cocteau
                         (getting aggravated)
                  illuminate.

        nothing happens.

                                phoenix
                         (laughing as he
                          disappears)
                  nah, i changed it again.  see ya...

                                associate bob
                  what a distasteful fellow.

        cocteau just looks at him.  enough already...

                                cocteau
                  oh shut up, bob.
