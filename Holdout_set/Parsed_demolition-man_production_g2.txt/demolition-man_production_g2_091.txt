        ext. court of stores - night

        spartan dodges the fusillade, looks around, takes stock
        of the whole situation.  an oncoming trolley comes around
        the corner into the complex.

                                spartan
                  now if we can just get them to
                  stay and play...

        spartan dashes to the trolley car.  he bounds up to
        the driver.

                                trolley driver
                  be well...?

                                spartan
                  be gone.

        spartan tugs the driver along with him out of the moving
        trolley.  he javelins a mighty thrust with the street
        sign into the back wheels of the trolley.
