        int. museum - armory room - day

        phoenix stands behind the civil war cannon.

                                phoenix
                         (amusing himself once
                          again)
                  what can i say, i'm a blast from
                  the past.

        he looks like a mad bandito.  draped in guns and ammo.

                                spartan (o.s.)
                  simon phoenix.  l.a.p.d., i mean
                  san angeles p.d.  you're under
                  arrest.

        where's the voice come from?  why does it sound so
        familiar?

                                phoenix
                  nah.  i don't think so.

        simon unleashes a barrage from a tommy gun draped around
        his neck.  keeps firing and firing and firing.  empties
        it.  not a very strategic move as he demolishes most of
        the cases in the room, including the one directly over
        spartan.

        a beretta falls at his feet.  an old police belt as well.
        spartan yanks out the magazine.  loads it.  collapses the
        bullshit stun baton and tucks it away.

                                spartan
                  hands up or i'll shoot, simon.
                         (beat; to himself)
                  fuck it.

        spartan comes up firing.  gets off about three shots
        before phoenix strafes the area with a hk91.  dives for
        cover.

                                phoenix
                  you were saying...
                         (recognition jolt)
                  spartan!  john spartan!  what's a
                  guy like you doing in a century
                  like this?

                                spartan
                  my job.

                                phoenix
                  who cares?  simon says bleed.

        phoenix unsheathes a pair of machine pistols.  blazes
        away.  tries the acmag.  still nothing.

                                phoenix
                         (re: the acmag)
                  come on, motherfucker.
                         (then)
                  well, we'll do it the old-
                  fashioned way...

        dumps another load of black powder into the cannon.
        strafes spartan.  tamps the powder down.  strafes spartan.
        spartan sees a 12-gauge auto loader and a box of shells
        across the aisle.

                                phoenix
                  so lemme get this straight -- they
                  defrosted you just to lassoo my
                  piddly ass?

        the magazine empties.  calculating the odds, spartan dives
        and rolls across the aisle.

                                spartan
                  i was in the neighborhood.

        he's concerned when there're no shots fired.  he oughta
        be.  phoenix drops in a cannon ball.  lights the fuse.
        aims.

        spartan comes up blazing.  lotta firepower in a 12-gauge
        at close range.  phoenix has a pair of six-shooters.  bad
        day at black rock.  cases shatter.  the cannon's pointed
        straight at spartan.  displays collapse.  phoenix
        flattens.  a mannequin falls across the cannon, pointing
        the muzzle down.

        phoenix pulls out the now-fully-charged acmag as the
        cannon fires.  right into the floor.  blows out one of
        the transparent panels.  the two of them collapse into
        the floor below.
