        int. cocteau's complex - cocteau's office - day

        cocteau is in a corner of the room in front of a private
        vidhead.  spartan stands with beretta pointed directly
        at him.  nonetheless, cocteau remains his arrogant self.

                                spartan
                  wonder about this, shithead.  you
                  think you can control this guy?
                  trust me... you can't.

                                cocteau
                         (a beat; unfazed)
                  is there something specific you plan
                  to do with that archaic device?

        spartan's not going to shoot him; lowers the gun.

                                cocteau
                  now, john spartan, do you not query
                  yourself that this misplaced
                  hostility is the result of your
                  transference of self hatred and
                  personal loathing?

                                spartan
                  what??

                                cocteau
                  perhaps you blame me for my role
                  in the progenation of the cryo
                  process.  that does not relieve
                  you of your burden of
                  responsibility for the commitment
                  of your initial crimes.

        spartan looks at him a long time.

                                spartan
                  fuck you.

        huxley visibly recoils.  the morality box braaaps.  it
        never gets any further.  spartan shoots it without a
        look, dead center.  his eyes never leave cocteau.
