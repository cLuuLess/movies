        ext. san angeles alley - night

        simon is behind a shiny silver building.  prying up a
        grate.

                                phoenix
                  no front door, no welcome mat,
                  what's with these people?  how
                  you supposed to show up and kill
                  somebody?

        he loves his own jokes.  climbs down in.  starts down a
        long ladder welded onto the side.  shuts the grate behind
        him.
