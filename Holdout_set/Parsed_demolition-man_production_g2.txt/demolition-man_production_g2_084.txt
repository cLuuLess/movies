        ext. taco bell - night

        it is unlike any taco bell we will ever see.  holographic
        images hover in the air in front of the marble entrance.
        a row of jacketed valets stands ready.  one rushes up.

        as they enter, a periscope pipe pops up, looks around,
        disappears.  no one notices it.
