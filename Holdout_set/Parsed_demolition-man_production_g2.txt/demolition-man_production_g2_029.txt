        int. cryo-prison - conference area - day

        the wall slides open and smithers enters into a ceiling-
        less space beneath the awesome tiers of cryo-cells.

                                female computer (v.o.)
                  thank you and be well, warden
                  william smithers.

        smithers grumbles past a barely conscious cryo-prisoner,
        who is strapped atop a sleek, thin, and uncomfortable
        "wheelchair."  two guards flank the hunched over and
        dripping convict as smithers plops behind an industrial
        chic table and flicks on his compuclipboard.

                                smithers
                  twenty-nine years ago, the parole
                  system, as you know it, was
                  rendered obsolete.  federal
                  statute 537-29 requires we go
                  through the formality of a
                  hearing for all prisoners
                  incarnated before the repeal
                  of the parole laws.
                  cocteau behavioral engineering,
                  b.e. will continue rehabilitation
                  by altering your behavior through
                  synaptic suggestion during
                  cryogenic sleep.  nightie night.
                  your hearing is now over.  you
                  are to be returned to your cryo-
                  cell immediately... 'mr. horace
                  bateman.'  do you understand what
                  i've said...

        eyes half open, the cryo-prisoner unsuccessfully gropes
        for a syllable.

                                smithers
                  guards, nod his head for him...
                         (yawning)
                  ne-xt.

        as the pathetic cryo-prisoner is wheeled off, the
        warden's voice echoes electronically from ---
