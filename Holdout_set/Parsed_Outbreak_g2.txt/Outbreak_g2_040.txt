int. rudy's pet shop (bonneville, oregon) close on
rudy - day
he doesn't look good, his face is flushed and sweaty,
his eyes glassy. he turns the "closed" sign around to
"open" and unlocks the door for an elderly lady,
mrs. foote, standing impatiently outside with her fat
persian cat in her arms. the bell tinkles as the door
opens and she enters.
                        mrs. foote
          rorshie didn't like the shredded
          veal wafers. i asked her and she
          said, 'can we change it for the
          beef chips?'
he's not up for this today.

                        mrs. foote
          are you okay, rudy?
                        rudy
          i'm fine, mrs. foote... it's hot.
          that's all. lemme open a win--
suddenly his face twitches, his body stiffens, his
eyes roll back and he falls to the floor, convulsing
violently.
mrs. foote screams.
                                              cut to:
