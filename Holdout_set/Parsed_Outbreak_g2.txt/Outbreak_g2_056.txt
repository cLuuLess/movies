          the genie's out of the bottle in
          bonneville, oregon, donny, and
          we've got to get him back in.
general mcclintock looks dumb.
                        ford
          cancel all leaves. mobilize all
          personnel. i'm going to want wind
          conditions and transmission rates
          -- for all insects, animals,
          marine, and human vectors. if
          this virus is spreading, i want to
          know how fast and where.
he looks at his computer monitor, which projects a map of
western oregon: the town of bonneville is close to the
columbia river.

                        ford
          bonneville's only five miles from
          the columbia river and if this
          mother gets there, we're in big
          shit trouble.

                        radioman
          we've got the secretary of defense
          on the radio. they had to wake
          him up.
gillespie unstraps himself and takes hold of the
microphone.
                        gillespie
                 (into mike)
          tell him it is colonel mike
          gillespie, commander of the u.s.

small oak-lined study (virginia)
where phillip goodell, the secretary of defense, is
dressed in his pajamas.
                        goodell
          give that to me one more time,
          colonel.
                        gillespie
          we've got to quarantine the    entire
          town of bonneville and do it
          quick. morning will be too     late --
          people will panic and try to    leave.
          if even one infected person    gets
          out, the entire effort could    be
          for nothing.
                        goodell
          why can't the state police do it?
                        gillespie
          they can shut down the major
          roads, but we need a much larger
          force to encircle the town.
                        goodell
          where would i get troops at this
          hour and have 'em in bonneville,
          oregon before sunrise?
                        gillespie
          fort lewis, washington, or ford
          ord, california. closer is
          better. sir, this is a doomsday
          disease.

          as deadly as a.i.d.s., but it kills
          within days. it could spread over
          the entire country.
goodell's wide awake now.
                        goodell
          does your commanding officer know
          about this?
                        gillespie
          yes, sir, of course. he asked me
          to call you.

                        goodell
          colonel, all i can do is refer the
          matter to the national security
          council. an  action of this scope
          would require the president's
          approval.
                        gillespie
          then get it, sir. right away,
          please.
they break radio contact.   salt looks at gillespie with
awe.
                        izzy
          if the c.d.c. asked us to help, why
          did you have to call the defense
          secretary? why didn't general
          ford make the call?
gillespie shifts uncomfortably.   salt realizes he's in
trouble.
                        izzy
          you bet your ass, captain.
          colonel gillespie has taken it
          upon himself to circumvent the
          entire chain of command.
the plane bounces in the turbulence.    salt turns to
gillespie.
                        salt
          you're shitting me?... sir?
                        gillespie
          i'll take full responsibility for
          whatever happens.

                        izzy
          that only means they'll hang you
          first.
                        gillespie
          don't worry, the c.d.c. -- and the
          president -- will invite us to
          bonneville.
                 (beat)
          they'll invite mary and jesus too.

          i just got a disturbing call from
          one of your officers, general.
intercut with:

ford in his office
sitting at his desk. as we hear goodell go on, a look of
anger builds on ford's face.
                        goodell
          i can tell the president we're
          looking at a situation you can
          contain with minimal loss of life,
          can't i?

freezes.
facing him are general ford and four men dressed in bl-4

one soldier closes the caskets and starts moving them out.
the others start unpacking the freezers.

the lead soldier raises his rifle at owi.
