ext. hospital helicopter landing area
salt carries a decontamination unit on his back,
gillespie a cellular phone and a black duffel bag as they
reach --

black hawk
where soldiers finish loading under the watchful eye of
sergeant meyer.
                          sergeant meyer
          atten-shun!
the soldiers salute gillespie and salt.
                        gillespie
          sergeant, general ford has ordered
          us to decon all aircraft before
          takeoff.
                                              (continued)

                                                       104.
continued:
                        sergeant meyer
          but we've been doing it at the
          base, sir.
                        gillespie
          vector transmission is increasing
          and airborne contamination must be
          minimized. pretty soon, sergeant,
          even that suit won't protect you.
                        sergeant meyer
                 (scared)
          yes, sir.
salt takes hold of sergeant meyer's walkie-talkie. the
sergeant is puzzled by this but says nothing as salt
sprays it thoroughly with disinfectant before handing it
back. he sprays the outside of the chopper, then moves
inside.
                        sergeant meyer
          the pilot is inside, sir!
                        gillespie
          i'll get him out.
                                            cut to:

outside chopper - seconds later
sergeant meyer reacts as the big rotor blades start to
turn. the chopper begins to rise:
                           sergeant meyer
          what the hell?

sergeant meyer reaches for his walkie-talkie, but it
won't work. he slams it down.
