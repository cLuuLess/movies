int. gillespie's bl-4 lab
the aluminum coffins containing jimbo scott and alice
still lie open. gillespie, berman, and owi anxiously
watch salt slip a slide under the scope and peer though
the eyepieces. a long beat. he moves carefully from one
field to the next.
                        izzy
          c'mon, for chrissakes.
salt shifts to another field, looks at it long and hard.
pulls his head back: hopelessness in his eyes.
                                            cut to:

                                                      62.
