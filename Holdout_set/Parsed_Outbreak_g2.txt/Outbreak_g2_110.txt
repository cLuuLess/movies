ext. columbia river - night (03:10)
eerie silence. a plane cruises over the forest on the
bonneville side. a waxy grey cloud fills the air. one
second. two seconds. the forest erupts in a wall of
fire.
                                              cut back to:

convoy of trucks and buses
heading out of town.    the fire burns in the b.g.
as the end of the convoy leaves the town, planes roar by.
as they drop a waxy grey cloud over the town of
bonneville --
                                              dissolve to:

                                                        138.
