ext. dugway (utah) - dusk
a gila monster hunts for prey, its eye darting back and
forth, its tongue twitching hungrily. it moves past:
the barbed-wire fence emblazoned with the sign warning:
"u.s. military property: trespassing strictly
prohibited."
behind the fence the duplexes are dark and abandoned.
the gila monster catches a fly and disappears into the
night.
                                           fade out.
