corinne stands at henry's bedside. she's getting sick
too: pale, sweating, starting to cough, but she's more
worried about henry, who's barely conscious.
                        dr. mascelli
          henry, we got it early, and you're
          gonna make it. but i need you to fight.
henry stares at him with blank eyes.
                           corrine
          fight, henry.     fight hard.
the overhead paging system goes off.

dr. mascelli rushes out.
                                             cut to:

emergency room
two paramedics wheel in tracy, the movie counter sales-
girl with the spiked haircut. her father runs alongside.
                        tracy's father
          doc, she got sick so fast. i
          thought it was the flu, then she
          fainted in the bathroom. she's
          hot, doc, so hot.
hold on dr. mascelli's fear, then --
                                             cut to:

                                                      61.
e.r. hallway - mascelli - minutes later
he's searching through a thick book on infectious
diseases. nurse emma approaches, near tears:
                        emma
          what's wrong with these people?
                          dr. mascelli
          i don't know.
intercut emergency room - b.g.
we see a roomful of people waiting to check in, including
mrs. logan (the black woman with purple hair) and her
toddler. suddenly the toddler starts coughing and
coughing. his lips turn blue.

                        mrs. logan
                 (screams)
          my baby. my baby!
dr. mascelli throws down the book and rushes out, past --
the fax machine, spitting out a sheet of paper. the words
at the top declare: "center for disease control, atlanta,
emergency bulletin."
fade up the roar of a chopper and --
                                            cut to:

ft. detrick - heliport (23:50)
as the bell chopper emblazoned with the boston police
logo hits ground, gillespie, berman, salt and owi yank
open the doors and pull out the two shiny aluminum
coffins.
