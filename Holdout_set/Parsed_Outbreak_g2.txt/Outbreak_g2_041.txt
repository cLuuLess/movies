int. bonneville general hospital - emergency room
computer keys pounding: "emergency room, bonneville
general hospital - september 1, 08:50."

dr. mascelli, 43, a local g.p. auscultates rudy's
chest with his stethoscope. a nurse, emma, starts
an iv. a second nurse, jim, puts an oxygen mask over
rudy's face. the lab tech, henry, 23, very serious,
wraps a tourniquet around rudy's arm and draws some
blood into three colored tubes.
                        dr. mascelli
          c'mon, rudy, talk to me!
no response. dr. mascelli rubs his knuckles into
rudy's chest. rudy groans.
                        emma
          they said he was fine yesterday.
                                              (continued)

                                                        52.
continued:
                        dr. mascelli
                 (rattled)
          and now he's in shock with
          pneumonia.
                 (to henry)
          get me some blood cultures.
henry nods as he fills a lavendar-topped tube with
rudy's blood.
                        dr. mascelli
          i've been reading about real bad
          strep cases. i bet this is one of
          'em. emma, don't leave him alone.
          his heart could stop any minute.

                                            cut to:

lab - close on lavender-topped tube - minutes later
spinning in a centrifuge. henry turns it off. in the
b.g., the radio blares with the mariners -- angels
game:
                        baseball radio
                        announcer (v.o.)
          johnson's ready... checks the
          runners... salmon is waiting.
          johnson delivers.
                 (a loud crack)
          that ball is hit. deep... deep...
          it's gone. the angels win!
                        henry
          damn!

without thinking he reaches into the centrifuge, but
it's still spinning. the lavendar tube shatters,
spraying rudy's blood everywhere.
henry squints. he's got blood in his eye.   he rushes
to the sink and washes it out.
                                            cut to:

emergency room office - minutes later
dr. mascelli trying to calm henry.
                                            (continued)

                                                       53.
continued:
                        dr. mascelli
          you washed it out. don't worry.
          but just in case, i'll put you
          on some penicillin
          prophylactically.
                        henry
          i wouldn't want to give it to my
          girl friend.
                        dr. mascelli
                 (nudging henry)
          cheer up, the penicillin'll kill
          that, too.

henry manages a smile.
