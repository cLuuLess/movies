ext. quarantine perimeter - night
massive chinook helicopters rumble over the staging area,
loaded down by the weight of the nerve gas they carry in
their bellies and the spray rigs which protrude on both
sides of the fuselage.
                                              cut to:

robby's room
the wall clock declares 11:30.     robby's still comatose.

          i was wrong.     the antiserum doesn't
          work.

salt shares his despair.
a long beat.     gillespie hands salt a paper.
                           gillespie
             take this. a signed declaration
             by me that at all times you were
             following my orders -- now get
             out of here.
                              salt
             -- no, sir.
gillespie's moved:

                           gillespie
             you'll be the only person left
             alive who knows the truth --
                              salt
             -- but, sir --
                           gillespie
             -- you will leave! you will not
             disobey an order.
                           salt
                    (very emotionally)
             yes, sir.

a)     in the pouring rain, ford surveys the vast
       machine he's assembled:

b)     soldiers in chemwar gear pile boxes of body bags
       into trucks.
c)     tractor drivers rev their engines and thunder
       forward to the front line of chinooks carrying
       the poison gas.
d)     corpsmen check their watches and flash their
       signal lights.
e)     the chinooks thunder into the air.

ford
all the parts move with such precision he should be proud.
but he's deeply troubled. he moves:

                                                         131.
