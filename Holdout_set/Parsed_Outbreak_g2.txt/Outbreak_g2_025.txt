int. ford's office - short time later
gillespie bursts in.   ford looks up from his desk.
                        gillespie
          the rebels hit iwabi's camp.
                         ford
          i know.
he swivels around in his chair to the world map on the wall.
                         ford
          they hit  kisangani, bukavu, and
          mbandaka  as well. three hundred
          thousand  acres of forest burned,
          at least  thirty-seven dead. i'm
          trying to  find out about iwabi.
                        gillespie
          he's all right, thank god. he was
          in kinshasha at his clinic but
          his entire field staff was killed.
          his whole lab destroyed.
                         ford
          terrible.
                        gillespie
          i want to continue working on
          motaba, sir.
                        ford
          look, as a scientist, i appreciate
          the fact that this one fascinates
          you --
                        gillespie
          -- it scares the shit out of me,
          sir.
                        ford
          colonel, the pentagon's biting my
          ass cause we're months behind on
          the anthrax studies. get 'em
          finished. take the heat off me.
                        (more)
                                              (continued)

                                                      37.
continued:
                        ford (cont'd)
          then you can fiddle with motaba
          as much as you like.
                        gillespie
          sir, if this virus came to
          america --
                        ford
          -- then it'd be outside our
          mandate. the cdc takes care of
          civilian problems. christ, now
          you've even got me buying into
          your paranoia. we can't protect
          everybody against everything.
          we've got to make decisions based
          on the odds, and the odds of
          motaba causing us any more trouble
          are a billion to one.
