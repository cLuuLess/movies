ext. pre-school
four and five-year-olds play happily in a sandbox outside
their pre-school which borders the columbia national
forest. their teacher, mrs. jeffries, carefully watches
over them.
betsy hides behind a nearby tree. she's hungry and can't
take her eyes off the half-eaten sandwiches lying in the
kids' snack boxes.
sean is distracted by a glimpse of betsy and spills his
juice all over geneva.

          you dodohead.
                 (breaking
                  into tears)
          mrs. jeffries, look what sean
          did.
                        sean
          i didn't... mean to!
                        mrs. jeffries
                 (taking her by
                  the hand)
          we'll clean you up right away.
                 (heads inside)
          the rest of you come in, too.
all the children follow her except sean, pouting. betsy
runs up and starts gobbling a sandwich. sean stares at
the monkey, then moves toward her:
                        sean
          hey, that's mine!
betsy hisses.   sean, scared, runs.

inside
                        sean
          a monkey stole my sandwich.
he points to the sandbox but there's no trace of betsy.
mrs. jeffries kneels.
                        mrs. jeffries
          there are no monkeys in this
          forest, sean. it's okay.
