ext. colonial home
gillespie knocks.    the dogs bark excitedly.
                          woman (o.s.)
          who is it?
the dogs recognize the voice and jump against the door.
                          gillespie
          mike.
roberta "robby" keough, an attractive, intelligent woman
in her mid 30's, opens the door a few inches, until the
latch lock chain snaps tight. the dogs try to push
inside.
                        robby
                 (smiles; delighted)
          hey, guys!

but when she looks at gillespie, she's guarded.
                        gillespie
          robby, i know i'm the last guy
          you'd do a favor for, but i've got
          no one else to ask.
                        robby
          my lawyer said not to talk to you
          anymore.
                        gillespie
          then just listen. i gotta go to
          zaire.
robby shakes her head, "no, no way."
                                                (continued)

                                                        11.

                         robby
           put 'em in a kennel.
                         gillespie
           so they can die of some weird
           disease like stripes did?
she mouths the word "no."
                         gillespie
           -- look, robby, if i had any other
           choice, i wouldn't be here.
                         robby
           you should've let me have them.
           you can't take care of them.
beat.   robby's torn.   the dogs nuzzle against her leg.
                         gillespie
           i won't be gone long.
                         robby
           you know i'm moving to atlanta --
           they want me to start in four days.
                         gillespie
           i'll be back before that.
                         robby
                  (sharply)
           four days is four weeks -- to you.
silence.
                         gillespie
           it wasn't all my fault, robby.
                          robby
                   (quietly)
           i know.
a long beat.
                         robby
           i'll look after them on one
           condition: if you're not back in
           four days, they're mine.
gillespie doesn't like it.
                          gillespie
           okay.
                                              (continued)

                                                       12.

                            robby
           in writing.
she unlatches the door and moves inside.   the dogs race
after her. gillespie enters...

front hall
overflowing with moving boxes, some sealed, others waiting
to be packed. gillespie feels awkward, a stranger in his
own home.
she hands him a prescription pad. he crosses off her
nameplate, "roberta keough, md," and starts writing
while robby enters...

kitchen
                         robby
           hey, guys, c'mon!
they follow her in.
                         robby
           guess what i got?
the dogs bark excitedly.
                            robby
           damn straight!
she opens the freezer, grabs a couple of frozen bagels and
flips them to the dogs. they catch the bagels and start
chomping.

                         robby
           i missed you guys so much.
gillespie hands her the note.
                         robby
                  (reading it)
           'i, michael gillespie, agree that
           if i'm not back in exactly four
           days from now, the ownership of my
           dogs, osler and harvey, will go
           to roberta keough.'
                  (handing it back)
           time and date it.
he does.   she points to a huge box on the kitchen
table:
                                            (continued)

                                                         13.
continued:
                        robby
          that's stuff from med school...
          some of it's yours. i don't know
          if you want any of it.
he fishes through it, shoving aside old medical books
and equipment. he finds an old wood stethoscope with
thick rubber tubing. he shoves in into his pocket.
                        gillespie
          got a place yet?
                          robby
          an apartment.

                        gillespie
          the first thing you'll do is spend
          the whole night unpacking...
          you'll stay up 'til dawn but
          you'll get everything in its
          place.
                        robby
                 (smiles)
          probably.
                        gillespie
          nothin' in my life has been
          organized since you left, robby.
beat. she's surprised at his admission. and un-
comfortable. so's he. he continues searching through
the box and pulls out...
a photo taken during their honeymoon cruise: they're
both smiling radiantly as they hold between them a
trophy of a dancing couple.
                        gillespie
          y'know, this is the only evidence
          on earth that i was ever graceful.
he checks her reaction.    there is a hint of a smile.
                          robby
          take it.
                        gillespie
          nah, people might see it... get
          the wrong impression.
he drops the photo back in the box and moves toward
the door.
                                             (continued)

                                                        14.

          four days.
                        gillespie
          or less.
as we hear the front door open and shut, hold on
robby: a hint of regret.
                                            cut to:

andrews air base, maryland
computer keys pounding: "andrews air base, maryland."

flood lights illuminate a huge c5a transport plane
waiting on the runway, its nose cocked open exposing
its innards to the pouring rain. several enlisted
men rapidly wheel equipment into the open hatch. a
private pushes a dolly loaded with boxes with the red
cross emblem up the ramp.
dr. isaac "izzy" berman, a short, bald army major in
his late 30's directs traffic.
                        izzy
          blood in the freezer over the
          right wing. c'mon! gut it!
          we're late.
the private grunts and pushes the dolly slowly up the
ramp. izzy lends a hand, and the two of them run it up
the ramp.
mike gillespie, dressed in a uniform, climbs down from
the cockpit. now we see his rank: colonel.
                        gillespie
          where the hell's yaffe?
                        izzy
          his wife... she's due tomorrow.
          i put him on leave.
                        gillespie
          we need him now! who's going to
          read the electron micrographs?
                        izzy
          i will.
                                            (continued)

                                                      15.
continued:
                        gillespie
          you can't even read a playboy
          pinup.
                        izzy
          he said he'd get a guy to fill in.
                           gillespie
          we can't wait.
a jeep drives across the tarmac, toward them and comes
to a park a short distance away. the driver scurries
out to open the passenger door to let --
general ford get out.

                        izzy
          what does he want?
the driver pulls two suitcases out of the jeep and
follows ford into the plane.
                        ford
          i'm comin' along, mike.
                        gillespie
          sir, we're going into very
          dangerous territory.
                        ford
          i'm well aware of the dangers.
                        gillespie
          beggin' your pardon, general, i
          don't think you are. you've had
          only the most cursory training
          on how to avoid contamination.
          concerns for your safety would
          distract us.
                        ford
          nothing distracts you, colonel.
          you won't even know i'm there.
                        gillespie
          sir, i'm not comfortable --
                         ford
          mike, have a little compassion for
          an old man who's been rotting
          behind a desk.
                         (more)

                                                    16.
continued:
                        ford (cont'd)
          for once i'd like to be there
          when one of these buggers hits.
          you're not going to tell me i
          can't go, colonel, are you?
                            gillespie
          no, sir.
                        ford
          good.  i feel wanted, now.
                 (beat)
          i get airsick in the back.    i'll
          be up with the pilot.

as they watch him move forward and out of sight:
                        izzy
          the guy wouldn't know a virus from
          a barbie doll. i'm not lookin'
          after him. he's yours.
                            gillespie
          bullshit.
                        izzy
          all of a sudden, playing golf and
          pushin' papers isn't good enough.
          damn, when i'm his age, that's all
          i'm gonna want to do.
gillespie flips a coin, covers it over his wrist.
                            izzy
          heads.     no!   tails.

gillespie lifts his hand and smiles.
                            izzy
          fuck!
gillespie grabs the phone to the cockpit.
                        gillespie
                 (into phone)
          rafferty, rock and roll with this bird.
