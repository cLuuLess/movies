int. ft. detrick military infectuous disease unit
(m.i.d.u.) - bl-4 lab - air lock
gillespie and berman, dressed in their bl-3 suits, stand
in the air lock.
                                              (continued)

                                                        30.
continued:
there's no sound other than the filtered air rushing from
a wall jet into the long red tubing attached to the back
of their helmets. these red tubes are called umbilical
cords. gillespie disconnects his, punches the wall plate
and enters...

main room of lab
quickly he connects to another umbilical cord; they hang
from the ceiling at ten foot intervals.
pavarotti and sutherland singing the duet from "lucia de
lamamoore" blasts from the speakers. whenever
gillespie's in the lab, he's listening to opera. he
approaches...
the space-suited figure working under the hood. the
figure turns and smiles; it's salt. gillespie's
surprised. salt salutes.
                        salt
          good afternoon, colonel, sir.
                        gillespie
          i thought you were doing your
          thesis at walter reede.
                        salt
          a lot's been published on herpes b
          but nothing on this new virus.
                        gillespie
          so you were hoping to change
          subjects and get your name on my
          research papers?

                        izzy
          our research papers.
                        salt
          i would do my share of the work,
          sir. more.
                        izzy
          and you wouldn't have to worry
          about anybody publishing the same
          thing cause there ain't nobody
          else crazy enough to work with
          this dangerous a virus.
salt hesitates, then beams.
                                              (continued)

                                                       31.
continued:
                        salt
          yes, sir! have you given the
          virus a name, sir?
                        gillespie
          motaba... after the valley where
          we found it.
                        salt
          i like it, sir.
                        izzy
          like it? listen to the way it
          rolls off your tongue. mo-ta-ba.
          like a perfume.

he lifts up a vial labeled motaba and puts it close to
his body as if he's putting on perfume.
salt watches with horror. in spite of their bl-4 suits,
you just don't play with these things. salt checks
gillespie, expecting the same reaction, but...
gillespie's enjoying the moment.   he expects these things
from berman.
izzy rubs the vial against his chest, savoring the
experience.
                        izzy
          one drop and you feel... so
          different... your lover will never
          recognize you again.
                 (shoving the vial
                  at salt)
          have some, captain.

izzy tosses the vial of motaba to wally, who, terrified,
doesn't know whether to catch it or not. but he does.
                        izzy
          good hands... that's important for
          working with level 4 viruses.
salt, trembling, notes that the vial is made of plastic.
                        salt
          this plastic is unbreakable,
          right?
                        izzy
          so far.
                                             (continued)

                                                        32.
continued:
a short, husky space-suited figure pushing a cart of test-
tubes round the corner. the name owigatsuyama is embla-
zoned above his breast, sergeant major stripes on his arm.
through his visor we see the face of a japanese-american
man in his early 60's with a warm friendly grin. we'll
know him as owi.
                        owi (space-suited figure)
                 (saluting gillespie)
          sir.
                 (gesturing to salt)
          he's here early. no coffee breaks.
                        gillespie
          should we let this guy horn in on
          our new virus, owi?
owi hesitates.
                        owi
          i don't think so.
                        gillespie
          well, that's that.
salt nervously eyes izzy:   "is this a joke?"
                        izzy
          captain, sergeant owigatsuyama
          here not only looks after
          everything in this lab, but since
          he knows the birthday of every
          great tenor and soprano who ever
          lived, dr. gillespie looks to him
          for supreme guidance on all
          matters.

                        salt
          just a minute! i could've changed
          the radio to jazz. i love jazz.
          but i didn't. whaddya haveta do
          to get on here?
                        gillespie
          get me a blood test for the motaba
          virus.
                        salt
          with a pcr catalyst i should be
          able to have a crude -- and i
          underscore crude -- screening test
          in a few weeks.
                                              (continued)

                                                      33.
continued:
                        izzy
          excellent. but nobody's asking
          you to work a hundred and fifty
          hours a week...
                        gillespie
          a hundred and twenty will be
          plenty.
                        izzy
          welcome aboard, captain.
                                            cut to:
