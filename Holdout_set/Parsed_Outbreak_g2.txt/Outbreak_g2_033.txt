          this bug definitely ate its
          wheaties.


angle on fourteen cages
each contains three or four different small mammals --
rats, guinea pigs, small lab mice, hamster, and rabbits.
all stone dead.

          it survives in air for twelve
          hours, and it survives in water
          for two hours.

          bullshit.

          hey, this little bugger's so  hardy
          it can read the whole sunday  ny
          times and not die, it can run  the
          hundred in nine flat, and it  can
          kill fish faster than my cat.
          voila!
a fish tank with a dozen dead fish floating on top.

          no test species has survived, even
          when i've treated them with all
          antivirals, including every damn
          antiserum. what's even worse is
          there's a latency phase. iwabi
          didn't see this in zaire, i don't
          know why, but some of the animals
          i've tested had the infection a
          long time before they showed any
          symptoms. they even tested
          negative but had the disease. if
          this is true of humans... why we
          could have it ourselves and not
          know it.
                        salt
          yet be spreading it.
                         izzy
          exactly.
                         salt
          holy shit.
