the other officers in the room grow silent as they see

          gentlemen, i have in my hand the
          final authorization to proceed,
          signed by the president. i know
          that each of us has doubts about
          what we are about to do. it is
          only human to have doubts when you
          are commanded to take the lives of
          other human beings. remember your
          wives, remember your children...
          they will all get the disease and
          die if we let fear govern our
          hearts. we are doing what is
          right, and what the nation
          requires of us.
pan across the grim faces.
                        ford
          i expect each man to do his duty.
          i know you won't fail.

black hawk (19:20)
gillespie standing beside the open door aiming an
infrared heat-sensing device down at the forest which is
so thick with trees you can only rarely catch glimpses of
the forest floor.


on computer monitor
swirls of colors -- like gases moving on the surface of
the sun -- diffuse across the screen. gradually, we see
that one bright red band is moving faster than the
others.
                        salt (o.s.)
          the monkey!
                        gillespie (o.s.)
          no, it's moving too fast.

forest below
a deer scurries across a clearing.

another angle
discover betsy: only a few hundred feet away from the
deer. afraid of man and his loud machines, she runs
deeper into the forest, hiding herself under the branches
of trees.

gillespie
picks up another swirl of red on the infra-red sensing
device. he points to it.
                         gillespie
            circle in.


another angle
open wide to show the chopper moving in a tight circle.

betsy
hearing the roar of the chopper louder and louder,
scurries up a tree and tries to hide.

gillespie
stares at the monitor. a faint red band appears in the
corner of the screen, then disappears.
                         gillespie
            starboard!
the chopper veers to the right and the red band glows
brighter and brighter.

                         gillespie
            lock!
the chopper hovers, then starts to descend straight down.
gillespie looks through binoculars at:

gillespie's pov
nothing but trees... trees... more trees... stop!    a patch
of black and white. a pair of frightened eyes.
betsy hisses at the terrifying monster.

                                                             124.
back to scene
                          salt
            drive her down! she falls from
            that height, she'll bleed out.
gillespie    jams cartridges containing turquoise liquid
into the    m-16. he fires. the bullets land above betsy.
she jumps    onto a lower branch. the bullets keep coming.
she jumps    onto:

on ground
gillespie fires. misses.     the blue liquid splatters
against a tree trunk.


betsy
caught in the open, darts toward a thick patch of trees --
safety. she's only a step away.

gillespie
fires again.

angle on betsy - slow motion shot
betsy's hit. she     spins, grabbing her arm in pain, then
gets up. tries to     make it to the next tree. goes down
on one knee. then     the other. she reaches out. cries
for freedom. then     collapses.
as gillespie lowers himself out the door --
