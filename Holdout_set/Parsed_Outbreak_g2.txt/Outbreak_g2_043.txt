int. theatre lobby - concession counter
henry hits the concession stand line just as it's
filling up before another movie in this multiplex.
he's still coughing. he covers his mouth as he coughs
again and again.
                                             (continued)

                                                         54.
continued:
movie patrons, children and adults, on all sides of
him are exposed to his "cold." hold on each of their
faces for a second as henry pushes his way to the
front of the line and grabs a handful of napkins.
                        henry
          could i please get something to
          drink?
tracy, the salesgirl with a spiked haircut regards him
with a hostile glance.
                        tracy
          you'll have to wait your turn,
          sir.

                        henry
          please -- i'm not feeling too good.
          a large coke. or pepsi. i don't
          care.
at the front of the line, a black woman (mrs. logan)
with a streak of purple in her hair holds her toddler
in her arms. she sees that henry is ill.
                        mrs. logan
          that's okay, let him go first.
henry, coughing violently, slaps down three dollars.
tracy serves him.
