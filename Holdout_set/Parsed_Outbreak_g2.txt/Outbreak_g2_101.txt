int. command center
buzzing with activity. dr. frankle and mcclintock stand
beside the computerized map of the quarantine area which
shows the red perimeter is within a half mile of the
columbia river. the clock reads 23:47. the radio
crackles with a louisiana drawl from the squadron
commander of the nerve gas team; we'll know him as
sandman one.
                        sandman one (v.o.)
          general, we got a problem. it's
          rainin' pitchforks up heah. the
          damn rain will dilute it down,
          barely be strong enough to kill a
          cat.

frankle's troubled too:
                          dr. frankle
          he's right.
ford agonizes.
                         ford
          to implement the plan and to kill
          only a portion of the population...
          that would cause great harm and
          solve nothing.
                         mcclintock
          sir!! the nerve gas rapidly loses
          its potency after it's mixed. the
          choppers have got enough to make
          two runs. the virus is a quarter
          mile from the river. you've got
          to go forward.

ford wavers.   he grabs the radio mike:
                        ford
          stand down!! return your squadron
          to base and stand down until you
          receive further orders.
                          sandman one (v.o.)
          acknowledge.    return to base.
ford moves into:

his private office
a highly secure area, sound-proofed for top-secret commu-
nications. mcclintock follows him in and slams the door
shut. they're completely alone.
                                               (continued)

                                                        132.
continued:
                        mcclintock
          how are you going to stop the
          virus from reaching the river?
                        ford
          napalm everything from the town
          outward.
                        mcclintock
          in the rain, the napalm will burn
          unevenly.
                        ford
          i'll take that chance.

                        mcclintock
          the virus will escape and we'll
          have to use nuclear weapons to
          sterlize the area.
                        ford
          i gave you my orders.
beat.   then quietly:
                        mcclintock
          let's say the antiserum did work,
          general. you'd bus out the people,
          move 'em somewhere, and treat 'em.
          and with luck some of them would
          live. but it's not going to work
          and in the meantime you don't
          understand what you've done.
                        ford
          i understand perfectly.

                        mcclintock
          no, you don't. we can't fool the
          media forever. they'll ask
          questions... there'll be
          inquiries... what we did was
          important. what we did was right,
          sir.
a long beat.   ford knows he's ruined either way he turns.
mcclintock's despair is deep and profound.
ford feels sorry for him, but:
                                              (continued)

                                                      133.
continued:
                        ford
          i'm sorry, but my decision stands.
          if there is any hope of avoiding
          this horrible contingency, i've
          got to...
mcclintock has slowly drawn his belt out of his trousers.
he quickly throws it around ford's neck, crosses it, and
pulls violently on the two ends. ford kicks and
struggles, but he's no match for mcclintock's strength.
                        mcclintock
          i am relieving you of command on
          the basis of cowardice in the face
          of a national emergency.

ford's dead. mcclintock lays him out on the floor.    opens
the door and screams into the main room.
                        mcclintock
          help!
he starts doing cpr as aides rush in.
                        mcclintock
          call the medics quickly. the
          general's had a heart attack.
one aide grabs the phone and calls the medics. two more
take over cpr. mcclintock straightens his shirt and moves
back into:
