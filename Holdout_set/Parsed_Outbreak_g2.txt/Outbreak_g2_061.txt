ext. bonneville general hospital (06:40)
a giant helicopter maneuvers a mobile bl-4 lab into the
parking lot behind the hospital. another chopper flies
behind it, carrying a portable pre-fab hospital. another
sets down and begins disgorging combat troops wearing
chem-warfare suits.

soldiers
dressed in chemical warfare gear and carrying m-16s ride
in a jeep through the center of the town.
the soldier with a megaphone bellows at a group of
townspeople gathered in front of a donut shop:
                         soldier
           go home and stay there or you will
           be placed under arrest.
the townspeople stare at these terrifying figures, then
quickly disperse.
reveal the next street over, and the next.     soldiers blast
out warnings.

                                               cut to:

tommy hull, his wife, darla, and two kids (06:40)
barreling along a gravel road in their pickup.
in the hazy light, tommy sees...
two infantry men in chem-war gear move into position on
the road and raise their guns toward the pickup.
tommy does not slow down.     his wife screams:
                         darla
           they'll shoot us!!
                           tommy
           they won't.

but he can't be certain.
the soldiers take aim.
tommy brings the pickup to a screeching stop, throwing up
gravel on all sides. he whips the vehicle around and
heads back toward town.
a chinook helicopter thunders overhead.
tommy scans the horizon for an escape.
                         tommy
           i know one place they won't think
           to go.

red pickup
bouncing along an overgrown creek bed, splashing water
everywhere, careening into the big rocks which litter the
creek bed. suddenly --
a helicopter gunship emerges over the tree-tops.
                        darla
          stop!
but tommy doesn't stop. the pickup keeps going -- smash-
ing and bashing its way up the creek. the gunship opens
fire, shredding the tires. the pickup thumps to a halt.
inside, darla and the children cry, tommy is shaken. the
helicopter hovers above them as the hulls climb out and
head back toward town.

                                             cut to:

state police car
coming to a fast stop at the highway checkpoint outside
bonneville as...
gunfire rings out from the distance.
inside, mike and robby react with alarm and climb out.
choppers roar by overhead, create a deafening blast.
the line of cars trying to get out of town is a quarter
mile long. they're held back by a...
long line of infantrymen in chem-war gear who look like
futuristic insects. this area will become the front lines
of a war. robby and mike race by the soldiers...
to the command where lieutenant colonel ronald briggs is
on the radio, coordinating his units.
                        robby
          you're using rubber bullets,
          aren't you?
briggs salutes gillespie.   he speaks with a georgia
accent.
                        lt. colonel briggs
          no, ma'am. my orders are that no
          one is to get out of this town.
                        robby
          you're operating under civilian
          control in a civilian disater.

continued:
a monster chinook comes down, sending up a torrent of
dust.
                        lt. colonel briggs
          no, ma'am, we're not.
he turns to...
the figure emerging from under the whirling blades:
general billy ford.
gillespie braces himself.   robby's surprised.    billy hands
robby a sealed document.
                        ford
          the secretary of defense and the
          president have made this a joint
          operation between the c.d.c. and
          the united states army. i've been
          placed in command.
ford goes straight over to gillespie. briggs intercepts
him halfway there, salutes, and reports:
                          lt. colonel briggs
          sir, since   we established our
          perimeter   at 06:20, nobody has
          penetrated   our line. before that,
          i can give   no guarantees.
                         ford
          there are one  thousand two hundred
          and eighteen  people living in this
          town. i want   every one of them
          accounted for  by 09:00.

                          lt. colonel briggs
          yes, sir.
he moves off.    ford and gillespie square off.
                        ford
          you're under arrest. with major
          berman and captain salt --
                        robby
          -- he was right. we were wrong --
                        ford
          -- stay out of it, robby.
          gillespie, you violated a direct
          order --
                                               (continued)

                                                        80.
continued:
                        gillespie
          -- the virus is airborne.
                         ford
          motaba is only spread by direct
          fluid contact.
                        gillespie
          since it left africa, it mutated.
                          ford
          that's crazy.
                        gillespie
          go to the hospital and see for
          yourself. leave your face bare.
ford starts away from gillespie.
                        robby
          you can't put him in jail. i need
          him. i need his whole team.
ford thinks for a moment.
                        ford
          very well. colonel, you, major
          berman, captain salt... can help
          dr. keough for the duration of
          this crisis, but you cannot leave
          this town and as soon as we get
          this under control, you'll be
          taken into custody.
                        gillespie
          major berman and captain salt
          were following my orders -- i am
          the only one at fault.
                        ford
          we'll let the court martial decide
          that.
suddenly robby's walkie-talkie squawks:
                        lisa aronson (v.o.)
          we got the host!
fade up the cacophony of shrieking animals and --
                                              cut to:

                                                        81.
