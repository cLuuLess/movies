int. dr. drew reynolds' office - day
computer keys pound: "office of the director, center
for disease control (cdc), atlanta, september 1."
dr. drew reynolds, 55, dressed in a doctor's coat,
paces in front of a bookcase filled with medical tomes
and topped by tennis trophies. reynolds has a rest-
less energy; he squeezes a tennis ball as he listens
to robby, sitting in a chair across from his desk,
with a folder of fax papers in her papers. she's
clearly intimidated by him, which is his intended
effect on everyone.
                        robby
          dr. gillespie wants us to send
          out a special bulletin warning all
          physicians to watch out for any
          symptoms of a virus from zaire
          named 'motaba.' he thinks it's
          serious enough to warrant
          emergency reporting nationwide,
          that it can't wait for our regular
          monthly report.
                        drew reynolds
          which will be released next week,
          correct?
                         robby
          wednesday.

                        drew reynolds
          to get out a special bulletin for
          four hundred thousand health
          professionals is about a hundred
          and fifty thousand dollars.
                        robby
          dr. gillespie says it's the worst
          virus he's ever studied --
                        drew reynolds
          -- forgive me, robby, but this is
          the guy who found three cases of
          congo fever in nairobi in '87,
          and suddenly it's in every
          american kid's lunch box --
                        robby
          -- you're not being fair --
                        drew reynolds
          in '91 he said tsutsugamushi
          fever was coming. in '92 it was
          ebola. his panics cost us plenty.
          around here he's known as doctor
          doom.
                         robby
          he could've been right about any
          of them. rule out the worst
          first... that's what my father
          always taught.
                        drew reynolds
          your father was one of the
          greatest surgeon generals this
          country ever had. he took me
          under his wing and let me fly.
          i've always been grateful. and
          i've always had a special feeling
          for you, robby. the... pain it
          gave him to see you working under
          gillespie... all your promise...
          the man never gave you a chance
          to show it.
a long silence.   drew has hit home.
                        drew reynolds
          look, is there a shred of evidence
          that motaba is more transmissible
          than the other filoviruses we've
          seen in the past?

                        robby
          no.
                        drew reynolds
          then as long as the bulletin goes
          out next week, we're covered.
