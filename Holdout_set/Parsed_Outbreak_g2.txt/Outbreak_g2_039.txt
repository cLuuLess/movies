int. elevator (descending) - robby
alone, very depressed, leans against the wall. we
sense, if somebody walked in and said hello, she'd cry.
the doors open into her floor and she gets out, not
making eye contact with anyone. she  enters...

her expansive office
her young assistants, dr. julio sanchez and dr. lisa
aronson, faxes in hand, join her from their neighboring
offices.
                        lisa aronson
          an e-coli outbreak in michigan at
          a couple of ronny's steakhouse
          franchises.
                        julio sanchez
          and -- a couple of fevers of
          unknown origin at boston municipal
          that the infectious disease docs
          can't figure out. that's all
          we've got on the log.

                        robby
                 (jesting)
          the boston case is not some guy
          out of zaire... with motaba, is it?
                        lisa aronson
                 (laughs)
          yeah, right! nah, it's a couple
          of americans. no unusual travel.
                        julio sanchez
          they've probably got some atypical
          strain of lyme and the boston
          doctors have just missed the boat.
                        robby
          then let's see if we can throw
          them a lifeline.

                                                        51.
