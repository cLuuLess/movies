int. bl-4 lab
robby, mike and izzy enter the animal lab and stop cold.
the brown rhesus is sitting up in his cage, weak but
eating some lettuce.

                        salt
          he should be dead.
the last of the antiserum drips into the animal's arm.
                        salt
          i gave him the antiserum.
                        izzy
          it doesn't work on people. it
          shouldn't work on simians either.
                        salt
          so how come it worked on this one?
gillespie's mind is racing:
                                              (continued)

                                                       95.
continued:
                        gillespie
          he was infected with the first
          strain, before it mutated.
                        izzy
          it still shouldn't work. this
          korean filo4 doesn't cross-react
          with the motaba virus. we checked!
                        gillespie
          maybe it's not korean filo4.
                        salt
          what else could it be?

izzy leans against the wall; he's pale, feverish.    the
others pay no attention.
                        izzy
          i need some air.
he takes a step, then starts seizing, his whole body
shaking in one convulsive wave after the next.
gillespie, robby and wally rush over.
                         salt
                  (checking his pulse)
          he's slowin' down. he's gonna
          arrest.
                         gillespie
          let's go.   now!
with extraordinary effort, he heaves izzy over his back.

                                           cut to:

crowded motaba ward
gillespie gently drops izzy onto a hospital bed.
                        gillespie
          ice, fluids, blood, oxygen...
          let's go!
gillespie puts a probe in berman's mouth, shudders when he
sees the reading.
                        gillespie
          a hundred and eight. ice... i
          want ice... i mean now!
                                           (continued)
                                                     96.
continued:

wally runs in with ice, packs it around berman's neck.
                        gillespie
          open your eyes. open your fuckin'
          eyes, izzy. nobody's lettin' you
          off so easy. pressure?
                          robby
          comin' up.
a long, long beat.   berman slowly opens his eyes.
gillespie smiles.
                        gillespie
          you were a hundred and eight. not
          too long... but long enough...
                 (an evil grin)
          you musta lost a billion brain
          cells.
                        izzy
          now i'm only as smart as you.
gillespie grins.
berman tries to smile. his lip twitches... uncontrolla-
bly. his whole body seizes.
                        gillespie
          we need a line.
robby flips gillespie a catheter set. he looks for a
vein. robby and wally try to keep izzy flat while
gillespie works, but...

slow motion shot
izzy's arm jerks free, pushing mike's hand and the razor-
sharp needle right at mike's other hand.
                          robby
          watch out!
she shoves mike's hand out of the path, but the needle
nicks her glove.
mike and wally are horrified.
                          gillespie
          lemme see it.
                                            (continued)

                                                        97.
continued:
                         robby
                 (yanks her hand away)
          it didn't get past the outer glove.
                 (to wally)
          hold him down.
wally pins izzy's arm down as robby sticks in an iv and
injects medicine. izzy stops seizing.
                                              cut to:
