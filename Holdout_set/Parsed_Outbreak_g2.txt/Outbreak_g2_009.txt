the pilot, captain rafferty, checks general ford,
nestled in safely behind him.

down below
gillespie pulls a lever and the hatch starts to close.
                           izzy
          wait!
mike follows his eyes out to the --

tarmac
where a black man carrying a duffel bag is sprinting
toward them at incredible speed, like a ghost through
the pelting rain.
berman swings the lever down and the hatch starts to
open but the man doesn't wait for it to lower
completely. without breaking stride, he leaps the
four feet onto the plane and slides to a stop right
in front of gillespie. he steadies himself and
salutes:
                        salt (black man)
          captain walter salt reporting, sir.
izzy smiles. he looks at gillespie, who is impressed
but won't show it.
                        salt
          i'm sorry to be late, sir. i was
          wrapping up some tests in my lab --
                           gillespie
          -- strap in.
the huge jet engines come to life. gillespie, berman,
and salt strap themselves into the row of jump seats
along the fuselage.
issy is filled with the excitement of a young kid who
can't believe his luck:

                        izzy
          you're not the football player
          from west point, that salt?
                           salt
          the same, sir.
                        izzy
          i thought you had the heisman
          sewed up 'til you hurt your knee.
                                              (continued)

                                                          18.
continued:
                        salt
          you and my mother, major... i was
          never that good. but thank you
          for saying so, sir.
                        izzy
          don't call me sir. the only one
          who does that is the colonel here.
          everyone else calls me izzy.
                           salt
          izzy, sir?
                        izzy
          my mother calls me isaac, but i
          hate it. i pitched for my high
          school team. my dad thought i
          was gonna be another dizzy dean.
          so he called me 'izzy.'
                        salt
          yes, sir, izzy, sir.
the plane surges forward and taxis down the runway.
                        gillespie
          i want to know just one thing.
          can you read electron micrographs
          as well as you can run?
                        salt
          i'm not sure how to assess the
          question --
                           izzy
          -- just    say 'yes, sir,' captain.
          whatever    the colonel asks, you
          just say    'yes, sir.' that's how
          we keep    him under control.
                        gillespie
          have you ever seen filovirus
          infection in a human being?
                           salt
          no, sir.
                        gillespie
          it's about as pretty as goin'
          naked up the middle against the
          dallas cowboys.
                                                (continued)

                                                     19.
continued:
                        salt
          i grew up on the south side of
          chicago, sir. whatever it is,
          i can handle it.
                        gillespie
          i hope so, because if you can't,
          you'll make a mistake. you'll
          be holding a needle and it'll
          slip. or your glove will have
          a crack in it and you won't notice.
          you work with filoviruses, it's
          like working with plutonium. a
          single drop of blood can hold
          six billion... that's more
          filoviruses than there are people
          in the world. you get a single
          one of those inside you, you're
          infected. say you're lucky and
          it's one of the few filoviruses
          we have antiserum for. then we
          can treat you and you'll probably
          live. but say you're unlucky.
          and you get one of those
          filoviruses we don't have an
          antiserum for, which is most of
          them. there's no medicine, no
          cure, nothing we can do to help
          you. your body gets so hot, your
          liver, your kidney, all your
          vital organs melt, and your skin
          turns into tapioca pudding.
stunned silence.
                        izzy
                 (smiles)
          he means chocolate pudding.
salt smiles slowly.   he likes izzy.
the wheels come up with a thump. the giant jet shakes
and rattles and soars into the air.
                                           shock cut to:

two u.s. army huey helicopters - day
flying low over the rain forest. the first carries
gillespie and his crew, the second is a gunship flying
escort. they pass over the wide motaba river that
snakes for miles.
                                           (continued)

                                                        20.
continued:
on the river: a zairean army patrol boat cruises down-
stream, looking for guerrillas. the machine gunner
swivels his cannon around at the two choppers.
the machine gunner looks up at the u.s. army insignia
and waves.
