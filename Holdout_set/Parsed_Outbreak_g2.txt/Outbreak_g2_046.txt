int. quarantine ward
jimbo lies near death in one bed, and his girl friend --
alice lies near death in another. plastic drapes
have been placed over both beds, holding the air
inside.

close on jimbo
the scarlet hemorrhagic rash can be seen on his
cheeks. blood trickles from his nose and his mouth,
and soaks his sheets. dr. sanchez is shocked at how
far gone jimbo is.
                        julio sanchez
                 (loudly)
          mister scott -- jimbo... we're
          trying to figure out how you got
          this disease. it's important, so
          try to help me. you work at an
          animal facility in san jose --
jimbo's eyes are blank.   he's dead.
                        boston doctor #1
          what's this guy got?
                          julio sanchez
          i don't know.    that's why we'll
          need a post.
                        boston doctor #2
          no way. i'm not gonna slip and
          cut myself and get what he's got.
                          boston doctor #1
          me neither.
suddenly from under her plastic protective shield,
alice stares over at jimbo's bed. she calls out,
her voice a whisper:
                                              (continued)

                                                       56.
continued:
                        alice
          jimbo -- jimbo? honey, are you
          all right...? answer me, please.
alice has just spoken her last words.   fade up the
whir of a suction pump and...
                                             cut to:
