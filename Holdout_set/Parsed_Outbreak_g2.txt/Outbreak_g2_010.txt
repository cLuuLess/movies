int. back of chopper
izzy slips the clear helmet over general ford's head.
pull back to reveal:
the general covered from head to toe in bl-4 bio-
safety suit. salt, dressed the same, looks on, amused.

                        ford
                 (panicking)
          how do you breath in here?
                        izzy
                 (laughs)
          with a respirator. positive
          pressure's what you want. keep
          those buggers out.
izzy flips the switch on ford's respirator, which sucks
air out of the atmosphere, filters it, and pumps it
into the suit. ford starts to swell up like the
pillsbury doughboy.
                        ford
          and i thought it was a hassle
          wearin' a tie all day.
