int. tommy hull's small house
darla and her two kids gather 'round the radio. in the
b.g. tommy takes a swig of whiskey. he's still trembling
from his encounter with the chopper.
                         tommy
          turn it off!
                         darla
          no.
tommy grabs the radio and throws it across the room, break-
ing it.

          we don't have it, goddamn it. but
          if we stay here, we'll get it.

          they're doctors. they know more
          than you.

          i know you're scared. we're all
          scared. but together we're going
          to get through this.
                                             cut to:

bonneville general hospital
a room full of motaba patients, all with antiserum running
through their iv's. dr. mascelli and izzy listen to the
radio. mascelli's eyes are blood-shot. he sneezes and
sniffles.
                        doctor mascelli
          and now i've got it too. i'm
          going to die along with the rest
          of them, aren't i?
the look in izzy's eyes confirms dr. mascelli's worst
fear.
