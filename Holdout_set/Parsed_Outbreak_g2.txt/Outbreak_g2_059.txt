int. hospital
robby, followed by mike, moves down the corridor.

                        robby
          on whose authority are you here,
          michael?
                        gillespie
          want me to leave?
she doesn't answer. we hear only the rush of air in their
suits, drowning out the horror we see as they pass room
after room of motaba patients, screaming and moaning in
pain. they pass...
izzy in a room with henry, the lab tech. lips blue,
gasping for every breath, he fights against the vent-
ilator. streaks of blood line the wall. in the next
bed is his girl friend, corinne, comatose and near death.

                                                        74.
continued:
a mother's cry of agony rips through the rush of air as
robby and mike pass the room where mrs. logan is holding
her dying toddler in her arms. her body is covered with
the fine red vesicular rash of end-stage motaba. she
pleads with salt, standing there in a biosafety suit,
completely helpless.
                        mother
          save my baby... please... save my
          baby.
robby exchanges a glance with gillespie.   she's
devastated.
                        gillespie
          i tried to warn you.
but nothing he could have said could have prepared her for
this. she moves on into...

small intensive care unit
crammed with ten patients on gurneys, all sick with end-
stage motaba.
nurse emma and dr. mascelli, in biosafety suits, pack
tracy, the movie-counter girl, in ice.
                         tracy
                 (delirious with
                  fever)
          daddy... daddy! where's my daddy?
robby looks at rudy, lying in the next cubicle, eyes com-
pletely yellow and lifeless, face and body covered in
black-and-blue splotches. his chest rises and falls in
short gasps.
                        gillespie
          bonneville patient zero. he never
          regained consciousness so we don't
          know how he got infected.
suddenly tracy starts convulsing.
                         dr. mascelli
          more valium.   quick.
                         emma
          we're out.
                        robby
          where's the crash cart?
                                              (continued)

                                                         75.
continued:
nurse emma nods to a sears roebuck-style tool cabinet in
the corner.
dr. mascelli starts for it, but gillespie's already there.
he punches off the plastic lock, rips open a drawer and
grabs a small box labeled valium. he flips it to...
robby, who in a second, pops it open, pulls out the
syringe of valium and shoots the yellow liquid into
tracy's iv. she stops seizing.
dr. mascelli and nurse emma are impressed.
                        robby
          dr. mascelli, we spoke on the
          phone, i'm dr. keough from the
          c.d.c.
one of the patients starts coughing.     gillespie and
robby are alarmed.
                        robby
          how many of your patients are
          coughing?
                        dr. mascelli
                 (indicating rudy)
          except for him, all of them.    why?
                                              smash cut to:
