int. station lobby
the security guard watches the newscast:    the governor of
oregon is giving a press conference.
                                             (continued)

                                                          117.
continued:
                        governor (v.o.)
                 (on t.v.)
          general ford and the army
          physicians have assured me there
          is no threat of spread of this
          disease at the present time.
          this is strictly a precautionary
          measure...
                        reporter from floor (v.o.)
                 (on t.v.)
          why have all communications in and
          out of bonneville been cut off?
                         governor (v.o.)
                  (on t.v.)
          there is apparently some kind of
          computer malfunction in that
          area...
the guard suddenly freezes.
salt and gillespie burst inside holding m-16s.

inside newsroom
                          anchorman
          in a related   story, the army has
          released the   names of two men who
          escaped from   bonneville and are
          infected with   this virus.
the pictures of gillespie and salt fill the screen.
suddenly there's a ruckus o.s. and the anchorman gasps
as the security guard, hands held high, moves toward
the news desk.
                          salt
          nobody move!
gillespie sits down beside the anchor. he shrinks back
as gillespie leans over, grabs his lapel mike and pins
it on himself.
                        gillespie
          i am not infected.
one of the two cameramen backs away from his camera and
bolts toward the door. salt points the gun at him, but
doesn't pull the trigger. more and more people stampede
out.
                                                (continued)

                                                      118.
continued:
                         salt
           shake it, colonel!
gillespie talks into the camera with the red light on.
                         gillespie
           we need help to find the animal
           carrying the motaba virus. it is
           a small black and white monkey and
           it was brought to northern
           california or oregon within the
           last two weeks. if you have any
           information about this monkey,
           please call this number at the
           c.d.c. in atlanta.

he holds up a crude sign with the numbers
"1-800-888-0000."
                         gillespie
           many people are going to die.
           this is their only chance.
           please... help us...
gillespie bolts up.   he and salt run out of the newsroom.
fade up police sirens and --
