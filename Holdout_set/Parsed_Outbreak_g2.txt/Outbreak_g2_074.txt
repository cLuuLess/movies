int. bio-test main office (san jose) - day
the office is a small, chaotic room filled with old filing
cabinets and ancient pc's. the company president, felder,
and lisa aronson sit near a speakerphone.
                         lisa aronson
                  (into phone)
           and i've been through all the
           files... no animal's been removed
           in the last fourteen days.
                         felder
           if jimbo scott got an infected
           animal, he didn't get it here.
intercut with:

                                                        94.
small office in back of bl-4 lab
gillispie, robby, and izzy are running out of options as
they converse with lisa aronson in san jose, california,
on the speakerphone:
                        gillespie
          could jimbo scott have deleated all
          traces of an animal stored at your
          facility?
                        felder (v.o.)
          don't be absurd, he was a good
          employee --
                        gillespie
          mr. felder, don't take this
          personally, but either you're a
          horrible judge of character or the
          world's in deep shit. could jimbo
          scott have erased all records on
          an animal stored at your facility?
          yes or no?
felder hesitates.
suddenly gillespie's walkie-talkie beeps:
                        salt (v.o.)
          colonel, come quick.
