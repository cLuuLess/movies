computer keys pounding: "victoria street theatre,
bonneville, oregon - september 1, 20:25 pdt."
henry sits with his girl friend, corinne, watching
a showing of the warner-kopelson blockbuster, thief
of araby. henry starts to cough violently, then
stands up.
                        corrine
          honey, what's wrong?
he's sweaty and pale.
                        henry
          nothin'. just thirsty... lemme
          get something to drink and i'll
          be okay.
henry heads up the aisle in the darkened theatre.
