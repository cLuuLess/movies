          a memo to the cdc to issue a
          warning to every physician in the
          united states to be on the
          look-out for this disease? what
          the hell is this?
                        gillespie
          a safeguard, sir.
                        ford
          are you nuts? within a week we'll
          know if this thing burned itself
          out in that village, just like
          iwabi said --

                        gillespie
          -- and if iwabi's wrong? american
          doctors should be warned so cases
          can be quarantined. sir, this one
          is different --
                        ford
          -- you're a smart guy, gillespie,
          but you can't write a memo to the
          cdc which says the sky is falling.
                        gillespie
                 (sharply)
          we should do nothing?
                        ford
          did i say that, colonel?
                 (beat)
          we will monitor the situation in
          africa, and if this virus
          reappears, we will act with all
          our resources, not just to protect
          the american people but the people
          of the world. you will destroy
          this memo. that's an order.
gillespie's frustrated.
                          gillespie
          yes, sir.
                                              smash cut to:

national airport (washington) - delta gate - day

          you asked for four days and four
          days it was... last night.
                        gillespie
          it was a bad virus... cut me some
          slack.
                        robby
          i cut you ten years of slack.      i'm
          not giving you the dogs.
                           gillespie
          stop joking.     where are they?

                        robby
          i shipped them this morning.
                           gillespie
          you did not.
on her face:   a triumphant smile.
                        robby
          it's better for them. and for
          you. i'll be there to feed them
          and take care of them. you won't
          have to feel guilty.
she moves past the gate.     gillespie's stuck behind it.
screaming after her:
                        gillespie
          i'm coming to atlanta... i'm
          takin' 'em back.

                           robby
          dream on.
hold on gillespie's dismay as she disappears.
                                               cut to:
