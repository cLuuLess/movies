          fire away! nothing's going to
          survive the crash.

a long beat.    gillespie's got him.

          you've got until midnight, mike.

forest surrounding town
the forest looks dark and   primeval in the damp night. the
sounds of bird calls and   crickets chirping can be heard in
the background. this is    what a biological meltdown looks
like -- nothing at all.    then suddenly a deer drops to
its knees, stricken with   the motaba virus. it struggles
to rise, but fails. the    deer keels over, barely
breathing.

outside quarantine perimeter - staging area

large canisters of deadly nerve gas are loaded onto
chinook helicopters. the canisters are clearly marked
with the skull-and-crossbones for "poison" and big red
"caution!" labels.

tubes run from betsy to a blood separator as salt works
feverishly to separate the antibodies out. as the
centrifuge spins faster and faster --

moving rapidly past the patients 'til he gets to:

izzy's room
gillespie's alarmed.   izzy looks terrible, his voice a
whisper:
                        izzy berman
          mike... i know you never liked
          my name.
                         gillespie
          what?
                        izzy berman
          my nickname -- izzy. you never
          really liked it.
                        gillespie
          i like it all right.
                        izzy
                 (smiles)
          it's okay, 'cause from now on you
          can call me hurricane.

                        gillespie
                 (smiles)
          i like it.
                        izzy
          good, 'cause i'm giving you a new
          name, too. guess what it is?
izzy's lips go dusky, his breathing only short gasps.
                         gillespie
          tell me.
                         izzy
          guess.
gillespie's voice breaks:
                                              (continued)

                                                         128.
continued:
                           gillespie
          i can't.
izzy's dead.   tears stream down gillespie's cheeks.
                                               cut to:

robby's room
she's lying in a bed, her face flush with fever, her skin
covered with the rash. she's just barely conscious enough
to see him at the door, watching her.
                         robby
          i'm scared.   so scared.
he comes toward her.
                           robby
          no false hope.     no games.
                        gillespie
          you can't give up.
                        robby
          just be with me.
he cups her hands in his gloved hand.
                           robby
          how's izzy?
                        gillespie
          he's gonna be okay. you're both
          going to be okay.

her eyes start to close.     gillespie, horrified, shakes
her:
                           gillespie
          stay with me!     fight!
she half opens her eyes, her voice a murmur.
                           robby
          hold... me.
he puts his arms around her.       screams into helmet radio:
                        gillespie
          salt, where the hell are you?
          salt, answer me!
                                               (continued)

                                                        129.
continued:
no response. a long beat. then gillespie... with more
tenderness than we've ever seen:
                        gillespie
          remember the first time we    made
          love? in  france. behind     the
          haystack.  and we were so    worried
          that the little boy on the    bicycle
          might see us.
she smiles, remembering.
                        gillespie
          i never felt anything except with
          you, robby. i was so stupid to
          let it slip away.
she closes her eyes.   a cry of anguish:
                           gillespie
          salt!
beat. then salt appears in the doorway holding a large
plastic bag of betsy's antiserum.
gillespie connects it to robby's iv and the brown fluid
flows into robby. gillespie sits down beside her. a
long beat. then he does:
something crazy. he removes the glove from his biosafety
suit so that his own bare hand can touch robby's skin.
he touches her face gently.
hold on gillespie, sitting beside his wife's bed, holding
her hand.
