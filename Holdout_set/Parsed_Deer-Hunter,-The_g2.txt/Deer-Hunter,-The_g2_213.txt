ext. greek orthodox church - front steps - day

a hearse waits at the curb. the day is windless, cold and
grey snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits a
ghostly cloud of white exhaust.

the sound of the choir is much louder, ascending in dark
triumph to a sudden, final note.

in the ringing silence of the music's end the doors to the
church swing open. nick, vince, albert and john appear with
merle's flag-draped coffin. followed by mourners, they bear
the coffin slowly down the steps.
