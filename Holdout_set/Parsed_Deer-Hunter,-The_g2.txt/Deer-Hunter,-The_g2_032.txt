int. v.f.w. post - coatroom - night

the rack is still jammed with couples but the laughing and
giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing
and low moans.
what light there is comes from the colored glass ball
revolving above the dance floor, where the music is now
playing sweet and low.

the front door comes open and a u.s. army sergeant steps into
the darkened hallway. the man wears his dress green uniform.
on his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are
brightly polished.

			sergeant
	pow!

the sergeant gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance
floor.
