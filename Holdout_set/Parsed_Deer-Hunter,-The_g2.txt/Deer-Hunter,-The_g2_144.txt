ext. busted-down old loggers shack - day

albert and john have dragged their two dead deer to a log
beside the shack. they sit side by side, drenched in sweat,
guzzling beer out of both hands.

			john
	sweet! oh, that is sweet!

			albert 
	hey! fuckin' a! just... just like a
	hot shit... except cold.

john lowers his beer. albert gives him a blank expression,
then cracks up. shots explode nearby. at first the shots are
scattered but they quickly open into a full barrage. albert
and john stand up.
