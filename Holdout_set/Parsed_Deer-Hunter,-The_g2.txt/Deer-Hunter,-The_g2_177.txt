ext. hospital grounds - embankment with money - day

nick looks down at the money scattered at his feet. the
bundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere.

			sal (v.o.)
	maybe you could use socks, nick.
	jesus, i mean, come to think of it
	socks are pretty expensive now.

			nick 
	it's not socks, sal.

nick bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking
for identification. there is nothing. as he straightens up he
notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the
bundles of bills.

the paper is about an inch square. the corners are tattered
and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket
for a long time.

nick picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and
unfolds it.

the card reads "exhibitions". it contains a telephone number
on the lower left corner and is identical to the card armand
gave to nick when he came upon him in the garden behind his
roulette game in saigon.
