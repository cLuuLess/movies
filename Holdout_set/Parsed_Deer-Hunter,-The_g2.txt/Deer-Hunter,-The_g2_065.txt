ext. dusty road - day

one of the fallen americans moves. camera closes on the
soldier. his face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a
gash in his temple. the face is unshaven, frighteningly
gaunt, but we recognize that it is merle.

a woman's scream comes from the direction of the huts. a shot
rings out. merle pulls himself to his hands and knees and
stands there, on all fours, like a dog.
