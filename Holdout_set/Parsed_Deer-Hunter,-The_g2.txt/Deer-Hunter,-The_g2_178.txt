nick leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable
cars of a coal train roll slowly by. sal sits with the
suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying.

			sal 
	who is it, nick? who is it? i don't
	understand.

nick looks at sal. his head is spinning and he brings himself
back with effort.

			nick 
	it's merle, sal.

			sal
	merle? ... merle's alive?
		(nick nods)
	how do you know?

			nick 
	i saw him last night. i thought i
	was dreaming. i thought i was out
	of my mind.

			sal 
	merle gave me this?

			nick 
	yeah.

			sal 
	but, nick... hey, i mean, where
	would a guy like merle get money
	like this?

nick is standing slightly behind sal, looking down at the
money. the reality of what merle is doing, has nearly
overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he
maintains a casual tone.

			nick 
	oh cards, maybe. poker... it's
	getting cold, sal. i'm going to
	take you in.
		(starts off)
	we'll call angela. the guys can
	help her bring you home... did i
	tell you i was going on a trip?

			sal 
		(panicked)
	trip? what do you mean, nick? you
	said you'd be --

			nick 
	it's okay. hey, it's okay! just a
	week. just to see phantom mary.

			sal 
	phantom mary?

			nick 
	didn't i ever tell you about
	phantom mary?

			sal 
		(laughs)
	no. 

			nick
		(starts off again)
	well... phantom mary's on my
	mother's side. naturally no one
	there admits it because phantom
	mary's pretty weird... you want to
	hear the whole story?

			sal
		(enthusiastically)
	yeah!

			nick 
	like i say, phantom mary's pretty
	weird... lives alone, lives way out
	in the middle of nowhere with a cat
	called pajamas and a cow called
	fred. well, last week i got a call
	from phantom mary, which in itself
	was very strange...
