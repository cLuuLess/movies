int. john's bar - day

the place is packed with boisterous steelworkers drinking
boilermakers. deerheads are mounted in a long row over the
bar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. the murals
depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once
comical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret
from the hunters, some power beyond their own.

john bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. at
the same moment sal comes in with nick, merle, albert and
vince. john, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his
tray, wraps his arms around sal and begins jumping him around
the floor, grinning ear to ear. the steelworkers turn, desert
their places and swarm around sal, joking and shouting
congratulations.
