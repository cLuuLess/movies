int. bride's house - bedroom - day

angela is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil. she is
plump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes.
angela leans forward into a mirror.

			angela
		(sincerely)
	i do.

a pause. angela scowls and tries it again.

			angela (cont'd)
		(heartfelt)
	i do.

angela tries it a few more times. it sounds worse and worse.

			angela (cont'd)
	i do, i do, i do!!!

angela stares at herself. now she looks desperate and
unrelievedly forlorn. bursting into tears she throws herself
on the bed. someone has slipped a photograph under the
pillow. the photograph is face down and as angela pulls it
out she sees that something is written on the back:

			angela (cont'd)
		(reading, slow)
	"this is it -- more or less...
	love, mom."

angela frowns, turns the photograph over. it is a picture of
michaelangelo's "david". angela stares at the figure for a
long, long moment...

			angela (cont'd)
	oh, wow.
