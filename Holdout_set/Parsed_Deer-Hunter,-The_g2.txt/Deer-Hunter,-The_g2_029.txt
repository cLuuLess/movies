int. v.f.w. post - trestle tables - night

the wedding cake that was carried in earlier has now been
attacked from all sides, but the miniature bride and groom
are still standing in the middle. unnoticed by each other
sal's mother and angela's mother eye the little figures. both
women are in rather teary condition and begin moving toward
the cake. suddenly, as the crowd shifts, they encounter each
other face to face. smiles are exchanged -- strained smiles,
which get stretched and stretched and stretched. then, in
unison, they desert the smiling and remove their respective
offspring from the cake. sal's mother looks down at her sugar
coated groom and angela's mother looks down at her sugar
coated bride. then they eye each other, burst into tears and
throw themselves in each other's arms, moaning and sobbing.
