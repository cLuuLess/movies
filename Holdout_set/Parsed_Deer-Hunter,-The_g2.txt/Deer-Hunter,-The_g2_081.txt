int. thatched hut - table area - day

sal is thrown in the chair. a south vietnamese is placed
opposite him. the south vietnamese is a kid, even younger
than sal, and he is trembling with terror.

			sal 
	hey, listen, you can do it. 
		(sal nods, smiles)
	believe me, you can do it. we can
	both do it. then we go home, see?
	then we go home!

sal looks down. the pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle
comes up pointing at the south vietnamese. the south
vietnamese stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his
eyes. the guards begin yelling at him, urging him on and then
sal gives him a smile of such unwavering faith that the south
vietnamese picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around,
cocks it and puts it to his temple. for a moment sal and the
south vietnamese look at each other. the south vietnamese is
taking his faith straight out of sal's eyes and now sal gives
him another encouraging nod.

the south vietnamese boy squeezes the trigger. there is an
explosion and his head disintegrates with a roar.

sal sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed
in an expression of terrible puzzlement. then his face begins
to move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to
discover a frown. sal looks around. he looks back again at
the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry.
