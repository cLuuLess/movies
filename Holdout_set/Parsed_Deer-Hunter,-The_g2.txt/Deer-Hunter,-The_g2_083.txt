ext. the pits - merle's pov - heavy rain - day

the pits are about twenty feet away. running mud and water
gurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the
downhill side. there are fewer hands than the day before, far
fewer. the nearest pit only has one pair and as merle watches
he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip.

suddenly one of the hands slips away. the hand comes back for
a moment, then both hands disappear.
