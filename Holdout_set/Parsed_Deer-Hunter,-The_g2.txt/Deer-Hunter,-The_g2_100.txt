ext. busy street - saigon - day

nick comes along the sidewalk in a crowd of pedestrians. he
is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting
along for hours. as he comes to a stop, staring at a south
vietnamese who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket
for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the
gutter. suddenly, across the street, something catches his
eye.

			nick 
		(calling)
	sal...! sal!!!

nick throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even
looking.

vehicles swerve and screech to a stop. nick dodges between
them, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand
on the back of a passing soldier. the soldier turns. it is
not sal at all and the resemblance is not even close.

			nick (cont'd)
	sorry... thought you were someone
	else.

the soldier continues on his way. the crowd streams on, a sea
of bobbing, brilliant color. nick gropes in his pocket and
produces another pint bottle. he unscrews the cap and downs a
long swallow.
