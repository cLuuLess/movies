ext. street - night

merle weaves down the street in front of the growling red
pontiac. merle is not just running. he is leaping and
bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a
realm of pure ethereal space.

nick, albert, vince and john pound down the street behind the
pontiac, albert carrying merle's clothes.

	merle!... unbelievable!
