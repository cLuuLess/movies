ext. rubber plantation - house - night

the gaming tables are utterly deserted. as nick wanders
through the empty rooms the sound of the game continues over
the p.a. system -- the sound of the cylinder spinning, the
sound of the hammer being cocked... and click after click
into empty chambers.

suddenly nick can stand it no more. he turns and starts
toward the entrance to the bleachers.

a shot explodes over the p.a. system. nick freezes, then he
runs.
