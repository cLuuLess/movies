int. u.s. army telephone center - saigon - day

banks of telephones line the wall. stretching out from the
telephones are long, ragged lines of servicemen waiting to
call home. the room is huge, full of echoes. re-enlistment
posters are plastered everywhere and canned latin music is
playing.

nick stands in one of the lines with only one person in front
of him. he looks anxious. he takes out his wallet again,
peers intently at linda's photograph, then puts it back.
nick takes a half-step forward -- staring at the telephone --
and then he stops, frozen with fear.

			gum chewer behind 
	go on, babe. take it. 's all yours!

			nick
		(mumbles)
	you go ahead.

camera holds on nick as he turns out of the line and heads
for the exit under a long row of clocks.
