int. steel mill - entry area - day

the time clocks are lined against both walls. as a whistle
screams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin
checking out. nick, sal and merle are right up in the front
ranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather
together along the wall.

			nick
	where's vince?

			sal
	there's albert! 
		(calls)
	hey, albert!!!

albert -- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox --
changes course and plows across the river of homeward-bound
steelworkers.

			albert
	how you feelin', sal?

			sal
	i feel okay.

			albert
	feeling hot?

			nick
		(arm around sal)
	humper's ready. old humper's
	hotter'n damn hell!

			merle 
	there's vince!

			others
		(calling)
	vince!... over here! vince!

			merle 
	get him, albert. get vince!

			albert 
	i'll get him.

albert wades back into the stream of steelworkers, grabs
vince and they all push out together.
