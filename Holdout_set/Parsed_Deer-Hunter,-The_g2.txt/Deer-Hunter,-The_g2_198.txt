int. shuttered building - night

nick finds his way blocked by a door. he steps back, hurls
himself against it. the door gives way with a crash and he
staggers into the middle of a small stage hung with red
velvet curtains and furnished with a table and two chairs.

out beyond the proscenium, huddled together in a litter of
broken cafe tables, a family of refugees stare at him in
terror from the other side of a small fire.

		(waves pistol)
	it's okay.

the refugees cower back even further.

			nick (cont'd)
		(screaming)
	it's okay, god damn it! it's all
	right!

pounding and banging come from the direction of the front
door. nick crosses...
