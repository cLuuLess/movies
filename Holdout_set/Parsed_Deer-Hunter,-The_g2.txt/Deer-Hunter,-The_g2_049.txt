ext. cadillac - night

vince, albert, nick and john pile out with their rifles.
vince immediately slips and falls down.

			vince 
	get 'em! for christ sake, get 'em!

			john 
	who's got the ammo?

			albert 
	ammo! get the ammo!

			vince 
	i'll get it! where is it?

			john 
	it's in the trunk!... it's in the
	trunk! i'm telling you, it's in the
	trunk!

vince, albert and john rush around to the trunk. albert
begins pounding on it.

			vince 
	there, albert! hit it there!

pushing and shoving each other, vince, albert and john rush
around to the side of the car. as they pass along the
embankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound,
like a sigh, and all three of them simultaneously vanish.

nick, who has been watching, stares at the place where his
three friends disappeared. he takes a few steps forward,
realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle of
the road, helpless with laughter.

			vince (cont'd)
		(getting out of the car)
	man, let's go hunting!... where are
	they?

nick makes a gesture, a downward pointing of his finger.
vince crosses to the side of the road.
