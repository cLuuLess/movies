int. nick's trailer - night

nick sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. his
hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he
is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the
window by a street light on the corner. there is a sound
outside, then the lights come on as linda enters with
groceries.

			linda
	nick?

			nick
	right here.

linda crosses to the doorway.

			linda
	what are you doing?

			nick
	oh. nothing... sitting.

			linda
	you're going hunting?

			nick
		(blankly)
	what?

			linda
	i see you're going hunting.

nick looks at the equipment on the floor.

			nick
	yeah... all the guys, we're all
	going huntin'. like we did. you
	know? like we always used to.

			linda 
	that's wonderful. i think you
	should... fresh air.

nick gets to his feet, suddenly. his face is twisted with
pain and his voice is cracked with emotion.

			nick 
	you know how sometimes you're going
	along... you're going along... and
	that's all...! one thing is right
	after another, like steps... and
	you step along.

nick can hardly breathe. it is as if he were choking.

			nick (cont'd)
	i don't know where that is... it's
	gone! that's gone!

a car pulls up outside. the horn begins blowing, then vince
and albert begin pounding on the wall of the trailer.

			vince (v.o.) 
	let's go!!!

			albert (v.o.) 
	hey! fuckin' a! time to roll!!!

			nick 
	i gotta go.

nick swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and
heads for the door. linda follows, still clutching her
groceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak.

			nick (cont'd)
	i'll be... i don't know... couple
	of days.

nick is gone. linda stands motionless, clutching her
groceries, staring at the trailer door. it is dark outside.
snow is blowing in. the door closes slowly, with a faint
hiss, and then clicks shut.
