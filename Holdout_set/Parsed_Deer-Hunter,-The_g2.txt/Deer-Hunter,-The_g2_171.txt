ext. intersection of columbine - night

no one. nothing. a beer can rolling in the wind.

nick jams himself against a wall, zippers his jacket. he is
irked with himself, a little frightened. suddenly he hears a
car door close and en engine start up. a black limousine
pulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly. a
chauffeur is at the wheel.
the passenger in back appears to be the man he saw, but the
man is looking out the window on the other side and his face
is not visible.

as nick watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed. the
tail lights grow small, then the car dips over a hill and
disappears.
