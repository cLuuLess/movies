ext. columbine street - twilight

the caddy appears, swerving onto columbine with tires
screaming and nick still leaning on the horn. the guys are
all hanging out the windows, shouting to friends, whistling
at girls and banging a triumphant tatoo on the doors.

	maxie! hey maxie wha'd'ya say!

			john
	hey geraldine, let's eat!

			vince
	nothin' to it, asshole! piece o'
	fuckin' cake!

as the car ascends the grade the mill appears behind it,
seeming to loom upward under the pink-streaked twilight sky.

camera holds as the car comes toward it. the headlights blaze
white, like huge hungry stars, and the eyes of the dead deer
on the fenders glitter gold and green and red.

albert leans out the window and gives his tarzan call... it
seems to echo, as if coming from far away,

							freeze frame...
