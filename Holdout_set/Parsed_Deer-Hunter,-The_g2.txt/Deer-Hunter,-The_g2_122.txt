int. nick's trailer - dawn

cakes, cookies, six-packs of beer and bottles of wine cover
almost every inch of available space. linda sits on the
little settee, wedged between two cases of coca-cola and
hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with
painful slowness, to knit. linda is trying not to cry. she is
trying her god-damnedest.

there is a knock at the door. linda freezes. then, trying to
be totally matter-of-fact, she puts down the sweater, crosses
to the door and opens it.

			nick
	guess who.

linda stares at him. nick gives a little laugh and steps in.

			linda
		(throws herself in his
		arms)
	nick! oh, nick, you're back!

she hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull
apart.

			linda (cont'd)
	i thought... oh, nick, i thought
	you were hurt, some accident. maybe
	you fell or maybe some car...
		(back in his arms)
	i thought someone stole you away!

			nick 
	no.

			linda 
	oh, nick! oh i missed you so!

they pull apart.

			linda (cont'd)
	how are you?

			nick 
	fine. i'm fine. how are you?

			linda 
	fine. i just go along, you know.
	down at the market. back here. i
	mean it just seems there's a
	million things to do!... are you
	sure you're all right? i mean, what
	about the wound?

			nick 
		(anger)
	that was nothing. that wasn't
	anything.

			linda 
	but --

			nick 
	it was just the complications. i
	mean, you take a little thing over
	there and then you get
	complications. i mean all the guys
	had it.

			linda 
	i made you a sweater. 
		(she gets it)
	here... you have to take that off.

nick removes his coat. linda pulls the sweater over him

			linda (cont'd)
	i couldn't remember your exact
	size.

the sweater is huge, a great rumpled thing reaching almost to
nick's knees.

			linda (cont'd)
		(smoothly)
	oh, that's fine. perfect... it is a
	little too big... 
		(she pulls the sweater
		back off)
	... but i can easily fix that.
	easily. one thing about wool
	sweaters, they are such a cinch to
	fix.

she crosses to a garbage pail out of nick's line of sight and
stuffs the sweater in it.

			nick 
	how's the trailer?

			linda 
	great. fine... once or twice it did
	fall off the blocks. i don't know
	what that's from.

			nick 
	frost.

			linda 
	is that what it is? i couldn't
	figure out.

			nick 
	did you get hurt? you didn't get
	hurt?

			linda 
	oh, no. it just kind of goes thump.
	would you like a coke? you don't
	drink coke. or maybe you do. what
	about champagne? let's have
	champagne! i don't think we have
	champagne. let's have this. see?
	sparkling. i'll get you an opener.
	oh, that's right. no opener. let's
	just have beer. do you want some
	cheese? or maybe eggs? maybe we
	should have coffee.

she begins to sob. camera closes on her face:

			linda (cont'd)
	nick? i'm so glad you're alive! i'm
	so happy! i... i just don't know
	what to do!
