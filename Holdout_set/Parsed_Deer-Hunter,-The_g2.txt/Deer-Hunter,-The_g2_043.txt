ext. hillside parking area - night

merle stands motionless, looking out across the valley as
nick approaches. the night is brilliantly clear and the fires
from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow.

nick comes to a stop a few feet away.

			nick 
	merle?

merle turns. his face has a strange, distant look, and he
gives nick an almost feral grin.

			merle 
	you think we'll ever come back?

			nick
		(startled)
	from nam?

			merle 
	yeah.

nick moves up beside him. he doesn't know what to say.

			merle (cont'd)
	i love this fuckin' place... that
	sounds crazy. i know that sounds
	crazy, but i love this fuckin'
	place... if anything happens, nick,
	don't leave me there. i mean it.
	don't leave me... you gotta
	promise, nick. you gotta promise me
	that.

			nick
		(half laughing)
	merle --

			merle 
	promise! you gotta promise!

			nick 
	you got it.

merle lets out his breath. it is as if some great weight had
been pressing on him.

			merle
		(with a laugh)
	let's go huntin'. i mean let's do
	it!
