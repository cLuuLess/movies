ext. john's bar - front entrance - day

the steelworkers stream into the snow with the women close
behind. several blows are delivered and the howls of
complaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get
dressed for sal's wedding.

camera closes on sal, who emerges with nick and merle. the
snow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop.

			sal 
	boy, this is it. this is really
	it... i mean... here i go.

sal's mother hurries out of the alley. she is crying.

			sal's mother 
	my beautiful boy! my angel... who
	is leaving his own mother.

she throws herself in sal's arms, sobbing.

			sal 
	momma...

			sal's mother 
	so cold is your heart to leave your
	own mother?

			sal 
	momma, i'll be right upstairs.

sal throws a look to nick and merle. they gesture with
sympathy and study the snow flakes.

			sal's mother 
	so cruel is your heart? is your
	heart so uncaring?

			sal
		(a litany now)
	one flight, momma. it's one flight.
