int. out-patient room - u.s. military hospital - saigon - day

the room is tiny, a cubicle furnished with a chair. nick is
alone, standing at the window looking out. he wears ill
fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the
pallor of his skin. around his neck is a piece of plastic on
which is stapled a colored paper marker. departing aircraft
thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby
hydraulic mechanism.
