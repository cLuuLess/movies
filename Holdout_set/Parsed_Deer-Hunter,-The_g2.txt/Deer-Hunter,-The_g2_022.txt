int. nick's trailer - day

the place is cramped, littered with camping paraphernalia. a
deer head is mounted above the sink and nick, who is half
into his tuxedo, is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy
boots. merle smiles, throws his kit on the stove and sits.

			merle
		(indicates the
		waterproofing)
	you should have put that on last
	night.

			nick 
	i know.

			merle 
	that way it sets.

			nick 
	yeah.

pause.

			merle 
	i just wait. you know?

			nick 
	huh?

			merle 
	i just wait. for this... it's what
	i wait for... i wait all year.

			nick 
	so do i.

			merle 
		(sharp)
	you do?

			nick 
		(nods)
	yeah.

nick grins, takes down his rifle and begins wiping the oil
off it.

			merle 
	you think about it?

			nick
	yeah.

			merle
	so do i.
		(watches nick for a
		minute)
	i want to be ready... you have to
	be ready... it has to be there, in
	your mind.

			nick
	the shot?

			merle
	fucking a.

			nick
	i don't think about the shot that
	much.

			merle
		(firmly)
	you have to think about the shot.
	it's the shot. the shot's it.

			nick
		(uncertain)
	yeah... i guess.

			merle 
		(studies him)
	what do you think about?

			nick 
	i don't know... i guess i think
	about the deer... being out, maybe.
	i don't know. i think about it all.
	hell, i like the trees, you know? i
	like the ways the trees are, all
	the different ways the trees are
	too.

			merle
		(with a glance to the
		window)
	i'll tell you something, nick. i
	wouldn't hunt with anyone but you.
	i won't hunt with a yo-yo.

			nick 
		(laughs)
	yo-yo! who's a yo-yo?

			merle 
	who's a yo-yo...? who do you
	think's a yo-yo! they're all yo
	yo's. i mean they're all great
	guys, for christ's sake, but... the
	point is, nick, without you i'd
	hunt alone. seriously. i would.
	that's what i'd do.

			nick
		(laughs)
	you're a fucking nut. you know
	that, merle? you're a fucking
	maniac!

			merle 
	yeah.
		(he grins)
	when it comes to hunting, that's
	true.

cursing and banging from outside. nick opens the door. john
and albert, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are
pounding on the trunk of the cadillac, trying to get it open.
nick and merle go out.
