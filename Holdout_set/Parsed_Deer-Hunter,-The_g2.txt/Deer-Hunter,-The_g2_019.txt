int. john's bar - day

nick, sal, merle, vince, albert and john are dancing. the
music is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut
with a knife. suddenly, from the back, comes a chorus of
screeches and female recriminations. the door to the alley
bursts open and the hefty ladies with truncheons appear. the
steelworkers take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their
heads in their hands and rush for the front door.
