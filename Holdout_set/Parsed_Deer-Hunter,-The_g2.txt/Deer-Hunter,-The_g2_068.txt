ext. grass huts day

the villagers -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in
a line. as the soldiers look on the v.c. lieutenant walks up
and down trying to extract information. the speared baby lies
in the dust between the two groups. the second baby tries to
play with it. the soldier who threw the dead baby in the air
squats nearby and yawns.
