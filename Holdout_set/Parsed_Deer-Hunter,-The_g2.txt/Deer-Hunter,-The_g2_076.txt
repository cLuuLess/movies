int. thatched hut - reverse angle - day

we see more south vietnamese and american prisoners standing
against the wall. most of them have been badly beaten and all
have their elbows tied behind their backs. in among them,
standing beside one another, are nick and sal. nick looks
grey, like a skinny ghost. sal is out of control, sobbing
quietly.
