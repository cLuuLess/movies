ext. russian orthodox church - front steps - night

nick sits on the steps with the toaster that sal's mother
gave him in his lap. it is snowing and from inside the church
we hear the choir singing. the sound is massive, deep and
dark, like a great river rolling through the night.

camera closes on nick. he is staring at something, tears
glistening in his eyes.
