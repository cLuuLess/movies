ext. nick's trailer - dusk

the trailer is lonely looking, dark and cold. vince pulls
into the yard beside nick's car and skips to a stop. nick
gets out, says a few words to vince and everyone laughs. nick
goes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and
pounds on the car. vince takes off, thudding over the curb
with his load of three dead deer.

nick crosses to the trailer and goes inside.
