int. nick's trailer - day

nick clears a place on the couch. linda sits, holding her
suitcase in her lap.

			linda
		(with great effort)
	i was just wondering... nick...
	you're going hunting... if i could
	use this place to stay, because...

			nick 
	sure. are you kidding? sure.

			linda 
	i'd want to pay you... and i was
	thinking --

			nick 
		(kneels in front of her)
	linda... hey, linda...

			linda
	i would want to pay you, nick...
	and i was thinking --

			nick
	linda, linda...!

			linda
		(very small, looking into
		his eyes)
	what?

			nick
	will you marry me?

			linda
		(after a long, long
		moment)
	okay.

			nick
	would you?

linda nods - a solemn nod.

			nick (cont'd)
	you would?

linda's lip begins to tremble. tears stand in her eyes and
she gives a little toss of her head.

			linda
	who else, dummy?

nick stares at her. he can still hardly believe it.

			nick
	this is terrific...! this is really
	terrific!

linda nods. she is suddenly excited, suddenly radiantly
happy. she takes the suitcase off her lap and throws herself
in nick's arms.

			nick (cont'd)
	i don't know what we've been
	waiting for!

			linda
		(eyes closed, loving him)
	i don't know! i don't know either!
