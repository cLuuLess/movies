			nick 
	albert! for christ's sake... john!
	wait a minute, you guys!

			albert
	it won't open.

			nick 
	you gotta hit it here. here,
	albert, not there.

			albert 
	where should i hit it? just show me
	where i should hit it.

			nick
	here. hit it here.

albert hits the trunk in the indicated spot and the lid snaps
open.

			albert 
	hey, that's neat.

nick nods.

			albert (cont'd)
	that's new, isn't it?

			nick 
	couple of weeks... listen --

			albert 
	i love this car. some cars sit, you
	know? this car, a car like this...
	grows. i mean you never know, with
	a car like this, where this car has
	been.

vince comes up, also in tuxedo, and dragging a totally
disorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him.

			vince 
	hey, guys...

			john
	shhh! albert's gonna hump the coup
	de ville.

albert looks around at his friends. he surveys the back end
of the cadillac with simian pride. then he expands his chest,
thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent,
mile-carrying tarzan call. as the echo of it comes back the
church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of
excited bridesmaids come, hurrying up.

			bridesmaid 1
	albert, what are you doing!

			bridesmaid 2
	hurry up, you guys!

			bridesmaid 3
	who's got their carnations?

			bridesmaid 4
	here. they're right here.

			bridesmaid 1 
	look at you! you're all a mess!

			bridesmaid 3
	put on their carnations!

			bridesmaid 1 
	who's got a pin?

as the bridesmaids begin straightening ties and putting on
carnations, nick hears someone call his name. he turns to
find linda standing beside the trailer where she can't be
seen. she looks pale and very frightened and she holds a
small suitcase in her hand.

			nick
		(crosses)
	linda...

			linda 
	hi.
		(forces a smile)
	nick, your shoes are soaking.

			nick 
	linda, what's the matter?

			linda
		(tries to toss it off)
	oh... you know...

she fights against it but the tears begin to come. nick looks
around, pulls her inside the trailer.
