ext. jet transport - debarkation ramp - night

a siren is screaming in the distance. nick looks around
nervously. the colonel is still right in beside him.

			colonel 
	tell you something else. don't eat
	'em in the damn delta. unless you
	like 'em fishy... some do. i don't.
	i never did.

the scream of the siren grows louder. suddenly a jeep careens
around the corner followed by a huge black cadillac flying
american flags on the fenders. both vehicles screech to a
stop and an mp jumps out of the jeep with a loud hailer.

			mp 
		(amplified)
	lieutenant biederman! lieutenant
	biederman report to the ramp!

			colonel 
	that's you.
		(grabs nick's arm and
		waves)
	right here, sergeant! he's right
	here!

			mp 
	right this way, lieutenant.

nick is hurried to the limousine where a second mp holds the
door.

			second mp 
	quick as you can, sir. we're in a
	rush.

nick gets in the limousine. the second mp slams the door,
jumps in the front and they take off with sirens wailing.
