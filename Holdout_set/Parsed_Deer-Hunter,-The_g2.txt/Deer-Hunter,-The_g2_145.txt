ext. highway embankment - day

the deer that vince was chasing earlier comes hobbling out of
the woods pursued by a group of half-drunk hunters. vince
comes barreling through the hunters, shouting and screaming.
vince's clothes are in tatters, the sole is gone from one
shoe and the barrel of his rifle is jammed up with mud and
perceptibly bent.

			vince 
	i got this one!!! this one's
	mine!!!

vince loses his footing and rolls down the embankment, head
over heels.
