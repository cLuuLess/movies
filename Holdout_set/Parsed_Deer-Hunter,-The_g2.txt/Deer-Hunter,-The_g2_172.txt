int. v.a. hospital - recreation room - day

sunlight streams through a window. the television is going.
in a far corner sal sits in his wheelchair, sleeping.

camera closes slowly on sal. his head has fallen to one side
and his single arm sticks into the air -- as if he had failed
in his grasp of something, as if he were drowning. on a tray
in front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice,
milk and a little box of wheaties.
