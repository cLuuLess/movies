int. thatched hut - table area - day

nick is at the table now, opposite a south vietnamese. he
holds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. his face is
twitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are
holding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for
a long time.

nick raises the pistol to his temple, clicks out. the guards
murmur. nick pushes the pistol across the table.
