ext. grass huts - day

the v.c. roust the villagers from their huts, smashing them
in the back with rifle butts. one of the soldiers emerges
from a hut carrying two small babies upside-down by their
feet. one of the women cries out. the soldier gives her a
kick, swings one of her babies in the air and lets it go. the
baby turns over and over against the blue sky. as the baby
comes down another soldier catches it through the neck on the
end of his bayonet.
