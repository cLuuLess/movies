int. steel mill - casting room - day

nick stands at the handle of a long metal rod. at the other
end of the rod albert and vince are attaching metallic
strips. when albert and vince have secured the strips they
signal to nick and all three of them lower their goggles.

camera pulls slowly back. nick is standing below a furnace
which is seven stories high, towering above him into a maze
of cat-walks and monstrous steel-hipped cranes.

albert and vince give a signal and the crane operator raises
the door at the bottom of the furnace. nick is now alone,
standing like don quixote with his lance. as nick advances
toward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of
his asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have
stuck to it burst into flame. within reach of the furnace
now, nick pauses. then, lifting the metal rod, he jams it
through the open doorway at the base of the furnace. there is
a white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a
geyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the
doorway, passing nick at the level of his shoulders and
showering him in a great cascade of white sparks.
