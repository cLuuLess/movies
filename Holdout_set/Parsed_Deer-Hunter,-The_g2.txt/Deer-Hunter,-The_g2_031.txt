int. v.f.w. post - dance floor - night

nick comes off the floor with linda and throws an arm around
merle.

			nick 
	sit with linda, man, will ya?...
	give her a beer.
		(to linda with great
		solicitude)
	would you like a beer?

			linda
		(puzzled)
	sure.

			nick 
	what kind of beer would you like?

			linda 
		(laughing)
	i don't know.

			nick
		(to merle)
	give her miller's. miller's high
	life.

nick takes off. linda sits down at a table and merle goes to
the cooler to get a miller's. he gropes around in the tub,
finds one and pops the tab. suddenly he notices that nick has
crossed to the sad-looking girl by the wall. he has stopped
in front of her and is asking her something. the sad-looking
girl gives a blush, gets out of her chair and nick takes her
in his arms and begins to dance. the sad-looking girl looks
transformed. she begins chattering and laughing.

merle crosses back to linda and gives her the beer. as he
pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and
nearly loses his balance. he is very drunk.

			merle 
	sorry.

			linda
		(laughs)
	it's okay, merle.

nick swings by with the sad-looking girl and waves.

			merle 
		(catching linda's
		expression)
	i guess you like nick.

			linda 
		(nods)
	yes.

merle doesn't say anything for a moment. he seems to be
trying to contain a floodtide of emotion.

			merle
	fuckin' nick... 
		(clears his throat)
	fuckin' nick... gives. 
		(he nods, bangs his fist
		on the table)
	gives. fuckin' nick gives.
