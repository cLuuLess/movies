int. tiger cage - heavy rain - day

merle turns away from the "pits". he looks down at sal, then
he looks at nick. his expression is one of exasperation, as
if he had been having a long argument.

			merle 
	i'm telling you, nick, no one's
	going to come.

			nick 
	what are you, god?

			merle
	listen, asshole, it's up to us!

			nick 
	they bombed last night, right?
	didn't they bomb? if they bombed
	last night, they could bomb
	tonight. they could be up there
	right now!

			merle 
	what are you, hoping?

			nick 
	what else?

			merle 
	i thought you might be praying.

			nick 
	i'm doing that too.

			merle 
	i suppose you wish you were
	somewhere else?

			nick 
	what do you think?

			merle 
	nick, you're wasting your time...
	listen to me! you're wasting your
	time! this is no fucking time for
	hoping or praying or wishing or any
	other shit! this is it. here we
	are... and we gotta get out!

			nick 
	you're right... okay, you're right.

			merle 
		(grabs him)
	get off your ass, nick. get off
	your fucking ass and stand up!!!

			nick
		(stands)
	okay, okay!
		(he straightens his
		shoulders)
	okay. okay, you're right... what
	about sal?

			merle 
	forget sal.

			nick 
	what do you mean?

			merle 
	i mean forget sal... sal can't take
	it, nick.

			nick 
	forget sal?

			merle 
	forget sal... listen to me --
	forget sal! i've been working on
	sal since dawn, nick. sal's in a
	dream and he won't come out.
	listen!!! from here on you gotta go
	for you. you hear me? for you!

			nick 
	merle...

			merle 
	listen, nick! get it through your
	head or you and me are both dead
	too!

a shout comes from the thatched hut. the south vietnamese
whip around in fright. merle and nick turn.

through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the v.c. guards
coming down from the thatched hut. the guards are all
drinking beer again and the guard in charge is waving the
pearl-handled revolver.

nick looks at merle. the sight has totally unnerved him.

			merle (cont'd)
		(calm)
	we gotta play with more bullets.

			nick 
	we what?

			merle 
	we gotta play with more bullets,
	nick. it's the only way.

			nick 
	more bullets in the gun?

			merle 
		(even)
	more bullets in the gun... the
	trouble is that still leaves one of
	us with his hands tied up, so that
	means we gotta play each other.

			nick 
		(numb)
	with more bullets?... against each
	other?... are you crazy!!! are you
	fucking nuts!!!

			merle 
	nick... nick!!! it's the only
	chance we've got!

nick stares at merle. rain is pouring off them in rivulets
and the voices of the approaching guards are getting louder.

			nick 
	how many bullets?

			merle
		(watching him)
	three bullets -- minimum.

			nick 
		(panic)
	no way. no fucking way!

			merle 
		(evenly, holding him with
		his eyes)
	i'll pick the moment, nick. the
	game goes on until i move. when i
	start shooting, go for the nearest
	guard and get his gun.

			nick 
	no. no way!

			merle
	when you get the ak, open up. you
	got me? open up.

			nick
		(screaming)
	you're crazy!!!... no way!... now
	you're crazy!!! you're completely
	crazy!!!

the guards begin screaming orders from outside the cage and
one of them lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which
shreds the bamboo roof just above the prisoners' heads. nick
and merle grab sal and drag him to the door.
