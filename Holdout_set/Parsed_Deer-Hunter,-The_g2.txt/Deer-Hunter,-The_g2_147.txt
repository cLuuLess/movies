ext. highway - day

cars are parked on both sides of the road. hunters are
sitting in the cars, drinking, eating sandwiches and warming
themselves at small fires. more hunters are up on the
embankment.

	i got this one!!! this one's
	mine!!!

the panicked deer bolts down the highway between the parked
cars. the hunters on the embankment open fire. the hunters in
the cars dive for cover.

			vince (cont'd)
	hold your fire! i got this one!!!

vince fires, fires again. shots are ringing everywhere.
hunters are shouting, running, yelling. a car window goes
out, a headlight goes out. the deer is hit, falls and gets
up. vince takes aim. a fleeing hunter bowls him over. the
deer bolts for the woods, bullets smashing all around it.
vince scrambles to his feet and plunges after it.
