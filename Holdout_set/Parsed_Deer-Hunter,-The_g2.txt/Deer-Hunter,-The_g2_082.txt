int. tiger cage - heavy rain - following day

a half-dozen south vietnamese sit huddled together in the
muck on the uphill side. a seventh lies sprawled on his back,
dead. the rain pours through the few leaves placed on the
roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the
floor.

on the downhill side are sal, nick and merle. sal is in a
fetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back
and forth. his eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an
expression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at
the table blow himself away. beside sal is nick. nick sits
slumped against the bamboo. one knee is raised and he is
picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn
at the knee.

merle is standing, gripping the bamboo walls of the cage and
looking out at the "pits".
