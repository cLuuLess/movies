ext. rubber plantation - trees by terrace - night

guests are still coming in from the cars, strolling down
through the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering
like birds.

laughter comes from the terrace. glass tinkles and the tiny
lanterns bob and sway.

nick appears, hurrying down the steps. suddenly he stops.

merle is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. he is alone,
dressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving guests with an
expression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops,
or snow flakes, or falling stones.

			nick
		(shouts)
	merle!

merle turns, watching nick as he crosses toward him. when
nick reaches the table, he stands.

			nick (cont'd)
	merle...! jesus! hey, how are you?

			merle 
	nick!... i thought you went home.

			nick 
	i did. i... this is stolen. i came
	back.

			merle 
	sit down.

nick sits. merle's self-possession has thrown him. he doesn't
know where to start.

			merle (cont'd)
		(breaking the silence)
	how's linda?

			nick 
	fine. she's fine... merle, what the
	hell are you doing?

			merle
		(eyes him)
	i like it, nick.

			nick
	merle... hey, merle, listen... 
		(stares at him)
	why?

for a moment merle doesn't answer. his eyes are pale, like
faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through nick, as if
to some landscape far beyond.

			merle
	i like it because it's simple.

a beautiful vietnamese girl steps up and whispers something
in merle's ear.

			merle (cont'd)
		(stands)
	i have to go, nick. we'll have a
	drink.

merle and the vietnamese girl move into the crowd.

			nick
	merle...! merle, wait!

nick starts after them. he can see them ahead, moving rapidly
through a group of arvn officers and whores.

			nick (cont'd)
	merle!!!

nick sees he can never overtake them directly. he cuts around
to the terrace.
