int. john's bar - night

nick sits at the bar, silent, hunched over a beer, lost in
thought. all around him steelworkers are shouting, yelling,
cracking jokes. after a moment vince pushes in, claps him on
the back.

			vince 
	how's it feel, huh? how's it feel
	to be back?

			nick
		(forced enthusiasm)
	great. feels great... fuckin' a!

			vince 
	i mean, i guess you still think
	about nam. right? i mean --

			nick 
	naw.
		(shakes his head)
	uh-huh.

			vince 
	hey, nick, you ever do it with one
	of those slants?

			nick 
	no.

			vince 
	no!

			nick 
	never one.

			vince 
	oh, jesus!
		(looks around)
	you're kiddin'!

			nick 
	one, vince... you have to
	understand, doing it with one...
	would be... like nothing. they're
	small, see, so if you're smart you
	get about six or eight. i mean, if
	you want to have any fun.

			vince 
	six or eight.
		(nods) 
	and they go wild?

			nick 
		(lowers his voice)
	they have these little sticks,
	vince. they call them "chomp
	chomps", and when you get these
	girls going, you have to stick 'em
	in their mouths.

vince stares at nick. his respiration is up, his mouth is
bone dry and his eyes are as big as saucers. for a moment his
belief is total, then a frown crosses his face.

			vince 
	you're full of shit!

			nick 
		(nods)
	yeah.

			vince
		(pounding him on the head)
	and i believed you! i oughta punch
	you out! i oughta...! hey. hey,
	let's go huntin'! albert! hey,
	albert! let's go huntin'. what do
	you say? nick? what do you say?

			nick 
	sure.

			albert 
	hey! fuckin' a! hey!

he spots john passing with a tray of beer.

			albert (cont'd)
	hey, john!

albert scoops john into his arms where he holds him from
behind.

			john
	yes, albert?

			albert
		(into his ear)
	john,we're going huntin'.

			john 
	who's going?

			albert
	we're all going.

			john

			john 
	no women?

			others 
	no! no women! jesus! what are you,
	crazy?

			john

they all take a beer. john raises his glass, solemnly.

			john (cont'd)
	here's to huntin'.

			albert 
	hey! fuckin' a!

			vince
		(hopping up and down)
	just like always! just like it
	always was! right, nick? am i
	right?

			nick 
	in the timeless words of squire
	albert...

vince cracks up, howling.

			vince 
	squire albert...

vince collapses on the floor.

			nick
	in the timeless words of squire
	albert...

			all
		(in a ragged chorus)
	hey! fuckin' a!!!
