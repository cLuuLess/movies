ext. narrow street (nick's pov) - night

seated on the sidewalk against the wall of the opposite
building is an old man surrounded by a collection of white
ceramic elephants. a truck roars by in front of him.
motorcycles sputter past and pedestrians hurry in both
directions. the old man sits motionless, like the guardian of
some timeless, silent kingdom.
