int. nearby bar - night

the place is as dark as the one before. music blasts from a
jukebox and two vaseline-covered girls are dancing. as nick
crosses to the bar to get change there is a whistling scream
and then the front wall of the building disintegrates in a
roar of noise.

nick pulls himself out of the debris. there is absolute
silence in the wrecked bar but rockets are coming in all over
the city and the explosions rumble and roar.
