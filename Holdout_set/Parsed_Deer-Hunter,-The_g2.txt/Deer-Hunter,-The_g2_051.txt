ext. cadillac - night

vince looks down at the three hunters with an expression of
absolute disgust. he looks at nick -- flat on his back,
pounding his feet, howling -- and then he looks at the deer.
the deer are still watching. if anything they have edged
closer and their massed expression of polite curiosity throws
vince into a blind rage.

			vince 
	get out of here, damn you! go
	home!... scat!... shoo!

vince, whose rifle is fully loaded, slams a shell into the
chamber and lets off a barrage of shots above the deer.

			vince (cont'd)
	bastards! assholes! get lost!
