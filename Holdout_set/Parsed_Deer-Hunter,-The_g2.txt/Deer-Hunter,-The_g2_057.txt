int. busted-down old loggers shack - night

the place is about nine-by-twelve. the floor is rotted out,
boards are missing from the walls and the entire structure is
canted to the right. hanging from the roof peak is a hissing
coleman lantern which sways in the wind.

vince, albert and john are sacked out, sound asleep. beer
cans -- some old, some new -- litter the floor. wet clothes,
most of them bloody, hang from tie-boards and nails. strung
up on the end wall are two deer carcasses, one of them with a
knife jammed in it where steaks have been cut out.
snow is blowing in -- dry, crystal bright. it swirls over
everything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor.

camera discovers merle and nick. they are both in sleeping
bags, lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the broken
door. the wind gusts and moans. the cabin shudders and then
there is a sudden lull.

			merle 
	hey, nick?

			nick 
	huh?

			merle
	tomorrow i go with vince.

			nick
	hunt with vince?

			merle
	yeah... i mean so he knows... he
	doesn't even know.
