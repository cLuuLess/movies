ext. ridge near camp - day

vince is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on
all fours. john and albert, who have reached a level area
above vince, unsling their rifles. shots are going off in
every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that
it sounds like a full scale war.

			vince 
	what are you, kiddin'? are you
	kiddin' me, albert? twenty times i
	coulda had her! she...! one time
	she begged me, practically begged
	me. listen, i had her tit, which
	was out, in one hand, and my other
	hand... you know that mole on the
	inside of her right leg? well, i
	was past that mole, way past that
	mole, and i was --

john nudges albert. four deer are coming down the slope,
single file. john and albert raise their rifles and fire. two
of the deer fall and the remaining take off. vince, who is
just getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls
down. john and albert drag vince to his feet and then rush
over to the two dead deer.

			vince (cont'd)
		(coming after them)
	nice shootin', you guys. not bad.
	not half bad.

leans his rifle on the horns of one of the fallen deer.

			vince (cont'd)
	'course how could you miss, right?
	twenty, maybe thirty feet. i mean,
	if i'd'a been where you guys were --

			john 
	psst. vince!

john signals with his head. vince turns. another deer has
come out of the woods. the deer is rattled by the gunfire and
peers at vince uncertainly. vince spins and grabs his gun,
which immediately goes off. he slams another shell in the
chamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is
hooked on the antlers of the dead deer and another shot
ricochets off a nearby rock. john and albert dive for cover.
as they look up, they see the deer trot down the slope and
then vince, firing wildly, running after it.
