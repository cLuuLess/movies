ext. supermarket.  day

people are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money. the store manager shakes his head and sends them away. the only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm, a little old lady carrying a rembrandt in a nice gold frame, a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock.
