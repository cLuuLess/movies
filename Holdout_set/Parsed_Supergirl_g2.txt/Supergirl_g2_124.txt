ext. selena's mansion. night 

rolls royces, limos, and maserattis parked in the driveway. it looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club. a helicopter lands on the front lawn. the elderly man from the garden party gets out and walks across the lawn toward the house with the aid of a cane. behind him the helicopter takes off again. selena opens her front door and confronts him angrily.

selena 
you're late.

	eld erl y man

walk out.

	selena
