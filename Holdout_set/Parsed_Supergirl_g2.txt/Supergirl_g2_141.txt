int. conservatory

supergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. she walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. in the bottom of the shallow pool she sees ethan securely bound. his eyes stare wildly. dead or drowning.

supergirl
				ethan!

she leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. a polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. it is a door to the phantom zone. supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. ethan is not there with her. his image has disappeared. 

the real flesh and blood ethan appears with selena from behind the strangler fig. they look in at supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the phantom zone. selena laughs at her, but ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall.

selena notices ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him.

selena
				enjoy your prison, supergirl. it's forever.

supergirl calls out to ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field.
