supergirl becomes very excited.

					supergirl
				that's the power source that was lost from argo 
city! that's what i came: to find! where does she live? 

	ethan
in this big old house on orchard avenue---but you better 
stay away from there.

	supergirl
i can see through walls. i could surprise her. the only 
thing i can't see through is lead, that's why i didn't 
see the power source at the amusement park.

she stands up.

					ethan
				wait. don't leave me.

supergirl
				you'll be safe here. i'll come back as soon as i have 
the power source.

he stands up and takes her hand.

ethan 
before you go...

	supergirl
what?

	ethan 
just one kiss. for old times' sake.


	supergirl
and you can see how you feel about me, right?

	ethan
yes.

she closes her eyes and parts her lips. slowly their lips come together and touch. then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking. but before either one of them can go one step further, ethan disappears with a flash of blinding white light. a cloud darkens the sun, and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale-force winds. selena's laughter can be heard from somewhere far away.

					supergirl
				ethan!

supergirl flies into the air.
