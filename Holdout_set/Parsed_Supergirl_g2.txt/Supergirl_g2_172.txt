ext. grassy meadow beside a pond

supergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. she collapses sobbing on the grass. the matterwand lies beside her.

supergirl
				zaltar, zaltar. you never had a selfish heart.

she looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her.

supergirl
				wherever you are, zaltar, thank 'you.  

she stands up and flexes her muscles. she no longer looks tired or disheveled. her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. she picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet.
