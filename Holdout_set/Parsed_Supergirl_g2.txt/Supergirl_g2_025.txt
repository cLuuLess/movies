ext. campus

a cat is stalking along a branch of a tree toward a nest of little baby birds. the nest is wedged on top of a window cornice on one of the buildings, but the tree branch passes just close enough by it for the cat to grab the baby birds when he gets there.

slowly the cat inches along the branch. suddenly a beam of light hits the branch. it bursts into flame, and falls down to the ground, saving the birds from any future danger. the cat turns around like a felon caught in the act, runs down the tree trunk, and scampers away.
