int. prison

the danvers and all the teenagers from the print shop are crowded into tiers of barred cells set into the walls of a dark, enormous cavern. jimmy and lucy huddle together for warmth in one of the tiny cells.

jimmy
				i sure wish superman was around. he wouldn't 
let any of this go on. not for one minute.

	lucy
i wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.

jimmy
				i heard stories.  i don't think you wanna know.

there is the clank of an iron door, and ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in selena's livery. he walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. lucy calls out as he passes.

lucy 
hey! ethan!

	ethan
hmmm?

lucy
				remember me? we were in a disaster together.

					ethan .
				oh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher.

					lucy
				right! say, do you swing any weight around here?

					ethan
				a little.

					lucy
				can you get us out? it's all a misunderstanding. we 
thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.

	ethan
i'll mention it upstairs.

he turns to go, but jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve.

					jimmy
				the blonde girl who saved your life---where 
is she now?

ethan pauses. buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain.

ethan
				she's gone. no one will ever see her again.
