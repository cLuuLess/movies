ext. amusement park. night

the park is deserted, in darkness. one by one the lights come on, outlining a1l the structures in jewel-like, fairyland colours. it looks strangely familiar. on some deep level there is a resemblance to argo city.

the camera pans over to reveal ethan standing beside the huge fairground switch boxes, turning on the lights. supergirl stands beside him.

ethan
				this is my favourite place in the city.

					supergirl
				are you sure it's all right for us to be here?

					ethan
				they don't care, they're tearing it down for a 
shopping centre.

he flips the last switch, which starts the ferris wheel revolving slowly, like a great spiral galaxy in space. soft music plays.

ethan
				like it?

					supergirl
				yes. it reminds me of home.

					ethan
where superman's from? krypton?

	supergirl
no. argo city. it was on a chunk of rock that was part of 
krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.

	ethan
i'm sorry, i don't understand.

	supergirl
it's not important. the important thing is i'm here to 
find something and i think you can he1p me.

	ethan
come on, let's ride.

they walk to the slowly revolving ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars.

ethan
				i used to work here summers when i was a kid.
				
supergirl
				ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.

					ethan
				let's talk about us, not her.

					supergirl
				tell me where i can find her.

					ethan
				i don't want you to go near her. she's bad news.
			


ethan puts his arm around her shoulders, casually, no big deal.

supergirl
				but be reasonable. if i don't do something to stop her 
she'll try again. and maybe hurt you.

	ethan
i'll be safe with you. we can stay together the rest of 
our lives.

	supergirl
we can't do that.

	ethan
why not ?

	supergirl
we're from different worlds.

	ethan
just give me a chance to show how much i love 
you. love changes everything. love makes 
everything possib1e.
