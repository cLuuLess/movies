ext. roof of hospital sunset

ethan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. he turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. he straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. he heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze.

selena
				give up?

ethan  takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the tall brick smokestack from the hospital's incinerator.

ethan
				never! 

he starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney.

					selena
				what goes up must come down.
