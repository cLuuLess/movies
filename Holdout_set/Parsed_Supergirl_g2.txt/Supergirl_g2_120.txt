ext. amusement park

supergirl reaches out to seize selena. but selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain.

supergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the haunted house. at super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at selena.



selena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. she turns too quickly and the gargoyle box slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. this is the opportunity supergirl needs. the fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around selena---effectively imprisoning her.

supergirl
				that ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.

selena 
a cheap trick.

	supergirl 
cheap but effective.
