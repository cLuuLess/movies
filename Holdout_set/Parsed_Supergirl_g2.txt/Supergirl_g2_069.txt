 int. selena' s mansion.  night

selena, is brooding in front of her mirror, which shows ethan in the hospital struggling with the two interns . selena covers the mirror with its heavy veil. she speaks to bianca standing beside her.

selena
				why did she have to show up now?

bianca 
eliminate her.

	selena
that's easy for you to say, bianca.

	bianca
you can do it. you're the most powerful woman 
on earth.

selena 
am i? still?

there is a pause as the implications reverberate.

bianca
				yes! you own the coffer of shadow. nothing can 
withstand its power.

selena 
i've been saving it. for the right moment.

bianca
				that moment is now! what good is a sword unless 
it be unsheathed? use it, and no one will dare 
oppose you again. no one.

selena toys with the idea in her mind, turning over the various arguments. a smile creeps across her face.

selena 
not even nigel.

selena goes to the secret compartment, opens it and takes out the metal gargoyle box. she looks at it with a dreamy, far-away expression on her face.
selena
				what do i do?  i don't know her name.

					bianca
				the naming of names is not necessary. just concentrate 
on her face. your shadow will do the rest.

selena holds the gargoyle box out in front of her and opens the lid. inside is the omegahedron power source from argo city, spinning around a strange dark region in its centre. selena closes her eyes and whispers to the spinning ring.

selena
				power of shadow hear me. find her wherever she be. 
find her and destroy her.

a black cloud of shadow bursts out of the centre of the omegahedron, filling the room. selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed. even bianca's face has gone white. the two women huddle together as a huge invisible presence fills the room with darkness. then the unseen presence suddenly smashes its way outside through the solid wall of selena's living room, leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it. light returns to the room as the shadow departs. and from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away. selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room.

selena
				next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.

bianca
				yes, of course, it was foolish of me.

bianca reaches down to the floor for the gargoyle box with the omegahedron, which is still lying right where selena dropped it. but selena quickly picks it up herself before bianca can touch it.

selena
				i think i'd better keep it.

					bianca
whatever you say.

selena 
yes. whatever i say.  from now on.

she shuts the lid of the gargoyle box, sealing the spinning omegahedron safely inside.
