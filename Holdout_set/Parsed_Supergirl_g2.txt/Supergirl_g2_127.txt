int. selena's living room/pagan temple. night

a barbaric ritual. selena's companions sway and gyrate to the sound of gongs and drums. the floor is covered with a red mist. in the middle of a column of fire a figure like selena seems to float. the ritual reaches its climax and everything pauses for a moment of sti11ness.

selena steps forth from the column of fire. she is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence. the six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe. selena seems to glow with an inner radiance. she laughs, and the pagan temple around her changes back to the living room of her house in midvale. in her shining gossamer gown and her new aura of majesty, she seems too large, too powerful to be contained in the familiar surroundings of her house.

selena
				at last. ultimate power.

					bianca
				and the first thing we do is get rid of supergirl!

					selena
				what do you mean we?

she turns on the kneeling six. they cringe from her. selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear.
