int. selena's house. living room. day

selena 
finished your estimate?

	ethan
well, there's several ways to go .

selena
				come in, have a drink, we'll talk.

she ushers him inside and sits him down in front of the vast hearth.

selena
				you must be very popular in the neighborhood. i always 
see your truck parked around.

	ethan
i have a lot of repeat business. people seem to like my 
service.

	selena
i bet they do.

	ethan
what's that big black scar on the ground? like a fire.

	selena
oh, you know how parties are. always some damage.

ethan spreads his drawings out on his knees.

					ethan
				now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs...depending 
on how alkaline your soil is. 

selena gives a cursory glance at the sketch, and then turns to a silver tray beside her. she picks up a frosty pitcher and pours an iced fruit drink into two tall glasses.

					selena 
				i just love plants and growing things. it must be 
wonderful to have green thumbs. cheers!

ethan looks at the drink with misgiving.

ethan
				uh, no thanks, i don't drink during the day.


selena gestures outside.
	
selena
				but look, it's almost sundown!

ethan glances outside. selena pours some poisonous looking red liquid into his glass from a tiny bottle hidden in her hand while his attention is distracted.

ethan
				really, i'm not thirsty. now i could put in some 
honeysuckle there and there...

selena pouts exaggeratedly.

selena
just take a sip or .i'll be hurt. it's an old family 
recipe, i'm famous for them.

ethan pauses. he doesn't want to offend his rich new customer over such a trifle.

ethan 
what is it?

	selena
a passionfruit smoothee.

		ethan
well, just one.

he takes his glass (with the extra ingredient) and clinks it against hers in a toast.

selena
				to us. and to the seeds we'll plant together.

ethan 
i'll drink to that.

he takes a careful sip of his drink, tastes, and smiles.


ethan 
hmmm. delicious!

he tosses off the rest of it in one gulp. selena watches him triumphantly.

ethan
now, about my fee...

he suddenly clutches his throat with a gasp and collapses unconscious on the couch. she leans over him and strokes his cheek delicately with her long red-nailed fingers.

selena
				sleep well. and when you wake, drown in my eyes 
and be all mine.

the doorbell rings.  selena looks up with annoyance.

selena
				if that's the jehovah's witnesses again...

she angrily walks toward the hall, casting a fond look back at ethan.

selena
				don't go away, gorgeous. i'll be right back.
