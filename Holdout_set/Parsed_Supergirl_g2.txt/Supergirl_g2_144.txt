ext. phantom zone 

another kind of reality. unlike anything we have ever seen. the crystal prison lands on the ground of the phantom zone and shatters. supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. the landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. as far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. she hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. with a shock she realises she can't fly.

she hops a few more times, with no more success.

she picks up a small rock from the ground. she tries to crush it in her hand. she can't. angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. she scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. she takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. she is barely able to disturb a few grains. she drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected.

suddenly she hears alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away.

 alura's voice 
kara, where are you?

	kara
mother? i can hardly hear you.

	alura. s voice
kara! you're alive. we were so worried. you disappeared 
from the scanners...

kara
				i'm lost, mother. in some awful place. i can't fly anymore. 
and i'm weak.

	alura's voice
kara, you must not give up. we must retrieve the 
power source. the city is dying.

					kara
				then send someone else. i failed.

					alura's voice
				we can't. the' dimension barrier is stronger. we no 
longer have the power to push through.

kara
				but mother, i'm lost. 

					alura' s voice 
you must try. . . it's cold. and dark. . .

the rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost. 

kara 
mother---i tried. i really tried.

kara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly.
