int. dorm room

lucy lane, still in her softball flannels, is digging mud out of her cleats with a swiss army knife held over a wastebasket. mr. danvers knocks on the open door, in the pre-entry signal of earth. lucy looks up.

lucy
				oh, mr. danvers, come in and park it.

					mr. danvers
				lucy, your roommate still home with anorexia?

lucy
				it wasn't anorexia. it was the food.

					mr danvers
				linda, this is lucy lane. you can room with her. 
show her around, lucy; i believe you know her 
cousin, mr., uh, kent. lucy turns into a bundle of 
enthusiasm. she grabs linda's suitcase and leads 
her into the room chattering away excitedly.

lucy
				wow, you're clark's cousin?? fabuloso! clark's a 
hunk. my sister lois was a real nerd to let that one 
get away. you'll love it here, we have a great dorm, 
some really insane characters, i mean radical craziness...
 
mr. danvers slips away, leaving the two new roommates to get acquainted.








lucy puts linda's suitcase on the bare mattress of the empty bed and opens the dresser drawers to help her unpack.

linda 
i can do that.

	lucy
no sweat. when's the rest of your stuff arriving?

she looks down at the nearly empty suitcase.
	
linda 
there isn't any.

lucy
this is all your clothes?

lucy involuntarily glances over her shoulder at the bulging closet beside. her own bed. lucy's bed is smothered with teddy bears, and the walls around it are covered with photos and posters of male rock singers, movie stars, and tennis players. also a large painted poster of superman.

linda
				i have money to buy more, but i haven't had a 
chance since...

	lucy
since what?? did you have a fire at your house or 
something?

	linda
i'd rather not talk about it.

	lucy
you're not...an orphan are you?

	linda
my cousin clark is my only relative on earth.

	lucy
oh wow, i should've known. me and my big mouth. listen, 
you can borrow any of my clothes you want. any time.

linda
				thank you. you're very kind.




lucy
				i'm real sorry, linda, i should've known it was 
something tragic if you show up without a 
wardrobe. here, try on this. and this.

lucy starts pulling clothes out of her closet and tossing to linda.
