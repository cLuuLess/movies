ext. hamburger heaven. night

lucy is in front of the local hamburger drive-in in her thunderbird convertible, talking to the foxiest dude at rindge tech. other teens are hanging out and listening to rock music outside the drive-in. lucy catches sight of linda walking along the side of the road.

lucy 
hey, linda!
     (to the boy) 
it's my roommate. you'll love her. she's really off 
the wall!

lucy jumps out of her car, runs over to linda, and whispers urgently in her ear.

lucy
				linda babes! there's this all-night party at eddie's...
his folks are away...

linda 
oh, i don't know. i'm not signed out
for an overnight.

	lucy
go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom 
window. mccloskey's always zonked out: 
she'll never hear you.

	linda
it doesn't seem right.

	lucy
please, as a favour to me? so i won't  be the only girl?

linda catches sight of a figure teetering down the centre, white line of the highway. cars honk and zoom past him.

linda 
look at that guy!

lucy whirls around and looks. 

					lucy
				what a space cadet. 
      (yelling and waving) 
hey, you dingleberry! get outta the street!

ethan ignores them, and continues to teeter deliriously.


insert.  ethan's p.o.v.

he sees the night as a fairyland of dancing, blurred lights: the neon of the hamburger stand; the garish pumps of the gas station across the street, the streaking head and taillights of the cars on either side. all sound is similarly distorted and far away.

back to scene

linda	
				why is he acting so strangely?

					lucy
				i dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
