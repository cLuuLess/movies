int. selena's new living room

selena looks up and realises ethan is behind her, looking intently at the image.

selena
				quit staring so hard. you'll strain your eyes.

she puts her hand on his cheek. he turns away from the image of supergirl and looks deep in 
selena's eyes.

					ethan
				you're not going to hurt her, are you?

selena is furious. her eyes get that dangerous look.

selena
				you can't put her out of your mind, is that it?

					ethan
				well...i guess i can't.

					selena
				i'm ready for her. i'll show you.

selena walks out the french doors followed by the dazed ethan.
