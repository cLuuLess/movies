ext. the phantom zone

supergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the phantom zone. we have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. she stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. she sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. it is hard to imagine her any worse off.

she hears a sound, vaguely familiar. she looks around for its source. she follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. the sound gets louder and as she, approaches. it is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres.

suddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the phantom zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. the harsh monochromatic sterility of the phantom zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. a dome-like building protrudes from the ground. all around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of argo city. a sculptor. in the clothing of argo city is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. he turns and catches sight of supergirl. it is zaltar.

supergirl
				zaltar.

zaltar drops his wand and comes running over to supergirl. he kneels beside her on the sandy ground.

zaltar
				kara? is it you?

supergirl nods. she is obviously exhausted. zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. she drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body.

supergirl 
what is this place?

	zaltar
this is the phantom zone. but why did you 
come here from argo city?

	supergirl 
i was on earth...

	zaltar
earth? you crossed the dimension barrier? by yourself?

	supergirl
yes. i went there to find the lost power source...


	zaltar 
shouldnt've done that.

	supergirl
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me 
to the phantom zone.

	zaltar
it's dangerous to use a power source on earth. it can 
unleash all sorts of terrible forces---

	supergirl
i know.

	zaltar
well, nothing we can do about it. come into my house. 
you can stay with me, until i build you your own 
place. i expect you won't want to mix with the others--
not our type of people.

he helps her to her feet and over to his house, a sort of argonian gothic cathedral half-buried in the sand. the curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of zaltar's work on argo city.

					supergirl
				others?

					zaltar
				criminals.

zaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right.

					zaltar
				a few hundred parasangs that way. i avoid 
them. and you should too.

zaltar leads supergirl past the singing sculptures. she smiles as she passes them, and remembers his "tree" in argo city.

supergirl 
...mid pleasures and palaces though i may roam..."

	zaltar 
what? palace? hardly.

	supergirl
just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of argo city...


zaltar
				yes. can't seem to get away from that style. 
must try something new.
