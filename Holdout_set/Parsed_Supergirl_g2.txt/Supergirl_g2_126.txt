ext. tropical beach. day

ethan wanders along the beach with supergirl, holding hands. she stops to pick up a seashell. ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache, moans, and collapses on the sand. supergirl kneels beside him.

					supergirl
				ethan, what is wrong?

ethan opens his eyes and looks at her. he speaks in a voice of bleak despair.

					ethan
				she said it wouldn't last.

supergirl
				what wouldn't last? what's the matter with you?

ethan sits up, wincing like someone with a bad hangover.

					ethan
				i don't love you any more.

supergirl 
just like that?

	ethan
like turning off a light.

he struggles to his feet and stands there unsteadily.
					
					ethan
				i feel awful. all that romantic garbage. all that 
mushy talk.

he lurches off into the undergrowth, toward the interior of the island. she plunges into the vegetation keeping pace with him.

supergirl 
where are you going?


ethan 
away. from you. 

	supergirl
but why?

ethan
				because you remind me of all the dumb things i said.

					supergirl
				i sort of like what you said.

					ethan
				that makes it worse.

					supergirl
				but i don't understand.

he stops and stares at her for a moment.

					ethan
				of course you don't. we're from two different 
worlds, remember?

he stalks off into the jungle, leaving her behind, hurt and bewildered.
