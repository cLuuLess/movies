int. computing class

mr. danvers is putting a fairly complicated equation on the blackboard. all the students sit at the consoles of little personal computers staring at their blank monitor screens. except for linda, who is staring intently at the wall on one side of the classroom.

time without certain algorithms.

linda stares out through the solid wall with her x-ray vision.
