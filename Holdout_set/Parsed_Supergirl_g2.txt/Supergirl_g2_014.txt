int. registrar's office

mr. danvers turns from his desk and glares at her.

 mr. danvers
				don't you believe in knocking?

linda
oh, yes. knocking. the pre-entry signal. i forgot.

she knocks on the open door. her manner is so open and guileless that mr. danvers, though
he gives her a strange look, does not put it down to smart-aleckyness, as he normally would.

mr. danvers 
what can i do for you?

	linda 
i'm linda lee.

my cousin wrote you.

mr. danvers stares at her blankly. he's a bit absent-minded.


mr . danvers 
cousin? wrote me?

linda looks at the metal filing cabinet behind his desk.

two beams of x-ray vision are faintly visible for an instant from her eyes.

linda
				the letter's in your files. under k, for kent.

mr. danvers opens his file and searches through it.

					linda
				i mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.

					mr. danvers
				here it is. oh...of course. you're the orphan. i'm so sorry 
about your parents. we'll try to make you happy here.

he rises and walks around the desk toward her. he puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion.
