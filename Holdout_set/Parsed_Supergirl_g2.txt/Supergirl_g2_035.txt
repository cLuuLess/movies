 int. dorm lounge

lucy and the other girls are stuffing themselves with popcorn turned out in bowlfulls by gloria's new hair dryer. the package it came from lies torn open on the table beside the hair-dryer. some of the girls start a playful popcorn-throwing fight in the b.g. one of the girls is strumming her guitar, and starts to sing "there's no place like home". one by one the other girls join in. it's a scene of high spirits and camaraderie, in contrast to linda's loneliness.
