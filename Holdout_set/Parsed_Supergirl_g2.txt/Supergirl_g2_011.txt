ext. midvale school. day

 a bus stops in front of the school. kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus. (from now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity linda lee.) linda walks up the driveway toward the main building. around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks. many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase.

in front of the school, lucy lane, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. she swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. linda walks up the steps to the main building.
