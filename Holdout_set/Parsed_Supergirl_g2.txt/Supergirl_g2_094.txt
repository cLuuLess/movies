int. operating theatre

a team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. ethan runs through in the background. the surgeons continue with their work. the heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets.

the surgical team doesn't look up from their work.

several cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after ethan and the other apparatus. one of the nurses finally looks up.

nurse
				doctor, i think you' re going to have a gas 
problem.

	doctor
