int. general assembly

the delegate from uritania is going on (in esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. a few bored delegates of various nationalities
are sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. the dign1fied president of the general assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. with a flash of light and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, selena appears beside the podium. she is in her shimmering white robe. the dozing delegates wake up with amazement. the uritanian delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone.
