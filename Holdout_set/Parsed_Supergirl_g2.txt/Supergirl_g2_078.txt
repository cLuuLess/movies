ext. outside the dorm. night

supergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. she raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice.

supergirl
				leave this place and do no harm.

something picks supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. supergirl picks herself up, shaken.




she launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. she crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. the irresistible force has met the immovable object. supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her x-ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a huge nightmare shape looming over her, and reaching out to crush her with massive talons. then the image fades.

supergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. she looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. she flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her.
