int. lucy's hospital room

lucy is showing off the controls of her bed. the door opens. lucy, jimmy and linda look with amazement at what's outside in the corridor.

lucy
				omigod.

a delivery boy enters with a spectacular floral arrangement.

delivery boy 
where you want this?

	lucy
over by the window. it must be from my sister. give him 
a tip, jimmy.

jimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy. suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct. everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm. but linda's x-ray vision lets her alone recognize ethan.

					jimmy
				gosh, what do you suppose .that is?

					linda
				well, lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. nice to 
meet you, jimmy.

	lucy
you're not gonna stay for the ice cream?

	linda
i have to get back. i'm having dinner with the danvers.

	lucy
again? you're getting real tight with them. you're gonna 
be a straight-a student---just kidding, thanks for coming.

her phone rings and she picks it up.

lucy
				phillip! when are you gonna come see me?
