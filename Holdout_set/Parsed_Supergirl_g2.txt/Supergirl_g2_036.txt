int. linda's dorm room

linda, still staring at the sunbeam shining through her room, and at the tiny dust motes dancing in the beam. from down the hall comes the sound of the girls singing, in improvised six-part harmony.

girls .o.s.)
"be it ever so humble, there's no place like 
home..."

a tear of self-pity and homesickness wells up in linda's eyes and runs down her cheek. she steps into the beam of sunlight and it shines full on her face. she suddenly hears alura's voice in her mind.

alura (o.s.) 
kara, my darling...

	linda
mother! is it you? where are you???

	alura (o.s.)
in argo city. have you found the power source?


	linda
mother, this world is so big. i don't know where 
to begin to look.

alura (o.s.)
				kara, be careful. there is some terrible evil force coming 
near you. i can feel it. keep to your disguise. let no one
know who you are.

linda
				but why? i have super powers. nothing can hurt me.

alura (o.s.)
				there are more powers in the universe than we know. 
and more than we can imagine. be careful, kara. and
come home safely.

the sun sets and the beam of light disappears as if a switch had been snapped off, leaving linda alone in the warm afterglow of twilight.

the soft strains of girls harmonizing float down the hall.

girls (o.s.) 
"...mid pleasures and palaces where'ere i roam, be 
it ever so humble, there's no place like home."
