int. phantom zone door

supergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison.

supergirl
				ethan! don't let her do this!

beyond the threshold of the zone, selena in her conservatory kisses ethan with fierce lust. he returns her , emotion, forgetting all about supergirl.

supergirl
no. no. it isn't true.

the image of selena and ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness.
