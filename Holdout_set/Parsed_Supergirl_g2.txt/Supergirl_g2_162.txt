int. zaltar's house in the zone

supergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. the window of the zone closes, and the image of ethan disappears. she crosses to zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders.

supergirl 
zaltar, please help me.

	zaltar
of course, my dear. what can i do?

	supergirl
help me to get back to earth. where my friends are. 
they need me.

zaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers.

					zaltar
				there's no way out of the zone. no one's ever escaped. 
that's why they send the criminals here.

supergirl
				if there's a way in, there must be a way out.

					zaltar
				no, that's not true---there's well...no--

he suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. he toys with it, while supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. he changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces.

zaltar 
there is a way.

	supergirl 
i knew it!

	zaltar
but it's impossible.

	supergirl
why?

	zaltar
no, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too---
if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity---
no, you'd never make it. forget i mentioned it.

supergirl's heart sinks. she rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness.

					zaltar
				i could do it.

she is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.

supergirl 
then teach me how.

	zaltar
no, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get 
one go. a thing like that. no. sure you don't want a 
sip of this? it's delicious, i think.


he takes another sip of his drink.

supergirl 
tell me how. to do it. if you could do it, i can.

he looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance.

zaltar
				takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. 
just begun to understand it myse1f. give things a 
kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards 
too. besides i can't let you take my wand. only have 
the one, what would i do? i'd be helpless. it's 
out of the question.

	supergirl
then come with me.

					zaltar
				leave the zone? what would i do on earth?

					supergirl
				you could do anything. you could sculpt 
mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! 
you'd have superpowers.

	zaltar
 superpowers. got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?

	supergirl
please. i have to get back to earth. my friends are 
in trouble. and unless i bring back the power 
source, argo city will die.

he looks at her kneeling beside his couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, pleading with him.

zaltar
oh, all right. stop crying. let's go.

he stands up, takes his matterwand, and heads for the stairs up to the surface. supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted. she runs after him, up the stairs.

supergirl
				you're going to take me back?

					zaltar
				going to try. didn't say i could.
