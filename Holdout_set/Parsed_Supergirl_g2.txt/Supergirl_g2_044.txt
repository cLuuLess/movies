ext. front door of mansion

nigel in a skin-tight vinyl jumpsuit with multidirectional chrome zippers is leaning on the bell. behind him his porsche is parked in the driveway, and beyond at the curb is a truck with ethan's nursery and landscaping painted on it. selena opens the door, sees nigel, and tries to close it. but nigel puts his foot in and keeps it open.

selena

					selena

					nigel
