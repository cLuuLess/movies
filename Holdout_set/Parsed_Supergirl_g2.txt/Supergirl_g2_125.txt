int. selena's living room. candlelit. night

waiting for her are an extraordinary group of people, all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party. bianca is talking to erica, a red-haired female dwarf. a proud, barefoot american indian woman in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular, young black man in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry. nigel is sulking in the bar, his face covered with tannisroot ointment.

selena enters with the elderly man in the banker pinstripe. they all form a circle in the centre of the room.

					selena
				let us begin. i invoke the rule of seven.

others in unison 
the circle is complete.

	nigel
you better have a pretty good explanation for 
this, selena.

	selena
we are in great danger. a being has come to earth 
with powers far beyond those of anyone member of 
the craft.

	indian woman
but superman has been away.

	selena
it is not superman i speak of, but his cousin kara. she 
knows we exist..

	elderly man
then she must be destroyed.

	nigel 
how did she find out about us?

	elderly man
that is unimportant. now that she knows, she will 
become curious and learn more. when she learns 
we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet 
and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will 
try to stop us.

	bianca
we must destroy her first.

	erica
but how can we destroy her?

selena
				by the rite of ultimate power. one person must 
volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all.

nigel stands up and points an accusing finger at selena.

nigel
you! you want to take our power for yourself!

selena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child.

					selena
				nige1, you know the one who takes on ultimate 
power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.

selena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it. inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly.

					selena
	 			      (continuing)
				which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?

					nigel
				you would! you revealed our existence so you could 
have all of our power.

	selena
maybe you'd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself, 
nigel?

	nigel
why get rid of her at al1? you've used the coffer 
of shadow too much.  it is beginning to rule your heart.

	selena
nonsense.

nigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror.

for an instant selena sees her reflection in the mirror. behind her looms the dark, evil presence, invisible to the others in the room, and much larger than when she glimpsed it at her garden party.

then bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. bianca stands challenging nigel, daring him to try again. selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped coffer of shadow, sitting beside her hearth. it too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. selena wonders for a beat if maybe nigel is right. can the shadow be ruling her?

bianca 
enough quibbling. let us vote.

they all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. they all look at nigel. his shoulders sag with dejection.

 					selena
				i invoke the rule of seven. do you agree?

nigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence. 

nigel
i have no choice.

his knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. everyone joins hands in the circle. a fire springs to life on the hearth. someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon.



the house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. the smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. the only thing remaining of selena's house is the hearth and the coffer of shadow. selena stands up and walks out of the centre of the circle toward the coffer. she opens the lid. she pulls the glass vial off the golden chain 
around her neck and drops it into the coffer.
