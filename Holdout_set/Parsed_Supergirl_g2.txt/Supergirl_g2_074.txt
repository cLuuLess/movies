ext. outside dorm. tennis court. night.

the dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. the tennis court is visible from linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. the unseen monster is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. a bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. the wind howls. a storm is brewing.

far away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. the unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake.
