linda smiles to herself.

mr. danvers (o.s.) 
linda? are you with us?

she turns to look at mr. danvers and finds everyone in class staring at her.

linda
				uh, yes, mr. danvers.

she looks at the board.

linda
				the answer is 5,271,009,010.

linda smiles, proud that she got the right answer. the other girls in the class laugh at her. even her friend lucy snickers. linda realizes she has made a mistake, but is not sure how serious it is. the class bell rings and the girls dash for the exit. linda stays in her seat staring at mr. danvers as he goes around the room switching off the computers.

mr. danvers
				you may go, linda. but try not to clown around in 
the future.

she meekly heads for the door. he turns to erase the blackboard. something stays his hand, and he looks at the problem. then he puts down the eraser and starts to copy the problem on a piece of paper.
