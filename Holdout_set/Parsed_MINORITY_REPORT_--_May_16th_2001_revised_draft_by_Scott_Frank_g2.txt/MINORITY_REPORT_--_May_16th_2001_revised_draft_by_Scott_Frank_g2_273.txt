		int.  precrime analytical room - night
		
		as the anne lively images distort into static, we now see an
		image of lamar burgess embracing anderton, the city skyline
		behind them.  we see anderton whisper in burgess' ear...
		burgess looks at him, then...
		
		                    burgess
		          forgive me, john.
		
		and now burgess shoots anderton at point blank range.
		
		                    fletcher
		          oh, god --
		
		on the red ball (victim)
		
		as it slows and we see the name john anderton...
