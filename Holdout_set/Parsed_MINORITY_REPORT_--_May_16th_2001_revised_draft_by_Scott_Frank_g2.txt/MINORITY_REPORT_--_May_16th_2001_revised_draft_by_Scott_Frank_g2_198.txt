		int.  hallway - day
		
		anderton steps into the hallway and looks at the door he just
		came through.  the "6" is lower than the other three numbers.
		
		now agatha watches as anderton reaches up and pivots the
		number "6" into a "9", making the number now even with the
		other three.
		
		                    anderton
		          it's the wrong room.
		
		he turns and looks across the hall at the real 1006.  he
		looks at his watch.  counting down: eight minutes...
		
		                    agatha
		          anderton...
		
		anderton knocks on the door.  no answer.  agatha recoils as
		anderton suddenly kicks the door open.
