		int.  precog temple - day
		
		as anderton comes through the door.  he starts to drag
		wally's desk over to barricade it...
		
		                    wally (o.s.)
		          hey!
		
		anderton turns, sees wally coming over now.  a look on his
		face...
		
		                    wally
		          what're you doing in here?  i'm
		          afraid i'm gonna have to ask you to
		          leave...
		
		anderton ignores him, puts a screwdriver in his mouth and
		jumps up and grabs a light fixture near the door, then pulls
		himself up like a gymnast.  wally is taken aback at the
		strength of the "old man..."
		
		                    wally
		          careful there, old timer, you're
		          gonna hurt yourself...
		
		anderton takes the screwdriver and jams the sliding-door
		mechanism with it, then jumps down beside wally.
		
		                    anderton
		          wally, listen to me...
		
		                    wally
		          do i know you?  who are you?
		
		anderton touches his face, realizes it's still sagging, old
		looking.  he grabs wally by the shirt...
		
		                    anderton
		          i like you, wally, so i'm not gonna
		          kick you, or hit you with anything,
		          but only if you promise to help
		          me...
		
		                    wally
		              (beat)
		          oh... hi, john.
