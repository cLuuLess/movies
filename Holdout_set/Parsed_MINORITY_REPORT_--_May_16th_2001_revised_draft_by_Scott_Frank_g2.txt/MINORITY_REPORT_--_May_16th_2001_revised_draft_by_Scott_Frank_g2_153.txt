		int.  tenement - hallway - day
		
		fletcher and knott come out of the stairwell, run up to
		anderton's door when they hear an indicator, see that the
		spyder has now gotten a reading.  they stop, look down as...
		
		all eight spyders come under the bottom of anderton's door
		and start back down the hallway...
		
		                    knott
		          let's eat.
		
		                                             dissolve to:
		
		a blurry image
		
		we hear the murmur of voices.  gradually, we begin to
		focus... objects whizzing by us... people all around... it's
		hard to see... it's all piled on top of each other...
		
		reveal: public transportation system
		
		anderton wears new clothing now.  he has dark sunglasses.  he
		waits for the subway to pull into the station.  he watches
		people getting on and off, all of them read by the eyedent
		scanner, the scanner light silently going from red to green
		as they pass.
		
		anderton takes a breath, gets on, relaxes as the scanner
		light turns green.
		
		he finds an empty seat and sits down.  he lowers his head,
		taking off his glasses and gently massages his eyes.  when he
		looks up, he sees...
		
		a mother and child.  blurry.  anderton's depth perception is
		all flattened out.  we can't tell, though, that they're both
		staring this way, the kid pointing now...
		
		                    kid
		          look at his eye --
		
		the mother hushes him up, points out the window at some sight
		to distract him.
		
		anderton turns and now we see his eyes.  one of them is
		milky.  the other is deep brown.
		
		both are red around the sockets from dr, eddie's rush job. 
		anderton turns and sees his blurred reflection in the window
		and quickly puts his sunglasses back on.
