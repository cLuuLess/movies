		int.  precrime - morning
		
		as anderton runs with his team -- five in all.  witwer trails
		behind them.
		
		                    fletcher
		          there's only sixteen of those old
		          merry-go-rounds left in the city. 
		          two of which are in georgetown. 
		          one in barnaby woods, the other
		          woodley.
		
		anderton looks at the readout fletcher hands him.
		
		                    anderton
		          woodley's all victorian.  it's
		          gotta be barnaby woods.
		              (keeps moving)
		          i want two cameras: one spyder, one
		          floater.
		
		witwer watches as anderton pulls a .45 from his waistband. 
		jacks the clip and checks it.
		
		                    witwer
		          as i recall, they outlawed
		          compression firearms in the
		          district ten years ago.
		
		                    anderton
		              (replacing the clip)
		          they did.  make yourself
		          comfortable.  we'll be back in an
		          hour.
		
		                    witwer
		          you mind if i tag along?
		
		some looks amid the team.  they know anderton doesn't want
		him here.
		
		                    anderton
		          i'd love to take you along,
		          inspector, but there's no room on
		          the ship.
