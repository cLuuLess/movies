		int.  the real 1006 - day
		
		someone definitely lives in this room.  the bed's unmade. 
		clothes are strewn about, hanging from open drawers. 
		anderton steps around a half-eaten meal that sits on the
		floor.
		
		he looks down and stares at a pile of polaroid photographs
		that sit on the dresser.
		
		all of them are of children.  some sitting on beds in hotel
		rooms like this one, looking afraid.  others in parks and
		schoolyards unaware that their picture was taken...
