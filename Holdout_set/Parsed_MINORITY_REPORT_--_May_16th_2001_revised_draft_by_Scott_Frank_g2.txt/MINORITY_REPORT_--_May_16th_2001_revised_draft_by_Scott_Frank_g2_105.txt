		ext.  a walled estate - day
		
		overgrown with vines and shrubbery of every possible variety. 
		anderton gets out of his vehicle and moves to a wooden gate. 
		a rusted no trespassing sign is nailed to it.
		
		anderton rings the bell.  no answer.  he peers through a
		crack in the gate.  we then...
		
		begin to crane up
		
		as anderton moves to the wall, and starts climbing the vines. 
		he gets to the top of the wall, looks out at...
		
		gardens
		
		wild and out of control.  a small ivy-covered stone house is
		nestled into a corner of the property.  smoke rises from the
		chimney.  anderton starts down the other side of the wall.
