		ext.  vehicle - day
		
		as it goes down a huge maglev "falls", straight down the face
		of a 200 foot building.  anderton climbs onto the nose of the
		car, his only hope to jump into one of the balconies that
		protrude out.
		
		as the car flies down, he tries to time his jump between the
		umbrellas and flowerpots that whiz by.  he finally makes the
		suicide leap, gets to a balcony and crashes through a table. 
		he picks himself up, goes through the door into...
		
		an exercise studio
		
		we hear rock & roll over as anderton now moves through a
		contortionist exercise class, people bent and bowed into
		impossible positions.  anderton looks back at the fellini-
		esque fever dream, then runs out the door.
