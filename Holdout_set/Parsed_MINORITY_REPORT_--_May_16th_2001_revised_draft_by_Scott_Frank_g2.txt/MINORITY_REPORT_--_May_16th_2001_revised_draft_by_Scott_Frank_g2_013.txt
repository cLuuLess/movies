		int.  precrime analytical room - morning
		
		as anderton focuses now on the "murder room".  he zooms in on
		a blurry nightstand clock.  a stack of books blocks it... he
		zooms out the window...
		
		                    anderton
		          i've got north facing shadows out
		          the window of the building behind. 
		          i need trig and image analysis...
		
		vectors from the shadows appear on the screen now.
		
		                    jad
		          workin' it.
		
		anderton turns and looks at three screens showing the male
		faces and the female face floating in the liquid we saw in
		the beginning.
		
		                    anderton
		          morning, detectives.
		
		the faces don't respond.  just stare into the void.  anderton
		touches the screen and now the female seems to turn and look
		at him.
