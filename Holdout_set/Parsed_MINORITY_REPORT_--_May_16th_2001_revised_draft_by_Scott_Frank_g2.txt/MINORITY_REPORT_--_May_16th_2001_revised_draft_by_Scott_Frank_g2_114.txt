		int.  tenement room - night
		
		as anderton's shout echoes and then fades.  he sits there a
		moment, listening to the sounds all around him.  he crushes
		the black inhaler and throws the pieces on the floor.
		
		he then takes a breath and feels around for the rope and
		starts for the kitchen, unaware of the precrime ship now
		moving past the window in the other direction...
