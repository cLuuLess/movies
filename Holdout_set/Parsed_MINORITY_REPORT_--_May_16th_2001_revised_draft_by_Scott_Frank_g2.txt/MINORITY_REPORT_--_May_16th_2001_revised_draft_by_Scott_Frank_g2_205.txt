		int.  hotel room - day
		
		we now hear the elevator ding.  anderton looks at his watch,
		gets to his feet.
		
		                    agatha
		          please, i want to go back...
		
		                    anderton
		          i can't leave.  you said so
		          yourself, there is no minority
		          report.  i don't have an
		          alternative future.
		
		                    agatha
		          but you still have a choice.  the
		          others never had a chance to see
		          their future.  you did.
		
		footsteps.  anderton waits.  the door slowly opens and we see
		crow peering around it.
		
		                    anderton
		          leo crow?
		
		the man does a strange thing: he glances at his watch.  then
		takes a deep breath...
		
		                    crow
		          who... who... the hell are you?
		
		anderton kicks the door shut on the man's hand.  crow screams
		and he goes down.  anderton steps on him.
		
		                    anderton
		          six years ago.  baltimore.  you
		          grabbed a kid at francis public
		          pool in the west end.
		
		                    crow
		          did i?  i don't recall... i got
		          lots of kids from that place --
		
		anderton kicks the man in the stomach.
		
		                    crow
		          jesus --
		
		he doubles over.  anderton grabs him by the hair, pulls his
		head up.  the guy is shaking like mad...
		
		                    anderton
		          do you know who i am?
		
		                    crow
		          some -- somebody's father?
		
		                    anderton
		          his name was sean.  six years ago. 
		          francis pool.
		
		the guy doesn't raise his head for a moment.  finally...
		
		                    crow
		          i told him i was a policeman...
		
		anderton reacts to this.
		
		                    crow
		          ... and that i needed his help.  it
		          wasn't so bad really.
		              (looks at anderton)
		          i sang him a song, made him laugh,
		          bought him a pretzel.  i took care
		          of him.  i made him happy.
		
		                    anderton
		          he's alive?
		
		the man just looks at him.  anderton is reeling...
		
		                    anderton
		          where've you got him?  is he all
		          right?
		              (shaking crow)
		          tell me, you fuck -- where is he?!
		
		                    crow
		              (beat)
		          i put him in a barrel and sunk him
		          in the bay.
		
		anderton stops.  shocked by this image.
		
		                    crow
		          it floated back up.  i had to take
		          him out and --
		
		                    anderton
		          no!
		
		anderton screams and throws him against the wall, ignoring
		agatha's screams for him to stop.  for his part, crow just
		covers up and waits for it to end, shouting over and over...
		
		                    crow
		          i'm sorry!  i'm sorry...
		
		insert - anderton's stopwatch.  counting down from 18
		seconds.  
		
		anderton pulls the man to his feet, shoves him up against the
		window and now stands there shaking, staring at crow, the man
		shaking as anderton weighs what he's about to do.
		
		and now behind crow, we see the revo billboard as it's
		hoisted upward by the crane, the smiling face coming around
		so that its grinning visage is just over crow's shoulder as
		it was in the prevision.
		
		he cuts a look into the mirror off to his left, sees the
		image of agatha, her face imploring...
		
		                    agatha
		          anderton, you can choose... you can
		          choose.
		
		insert - anderton's watch.  counting down from 5 - 4 - 3 -
		2 - 1 - the alarm on the watch goes off.  beep.  beep.  beep.
		beep.  beep.
		
		finally, tears in his eyes, anderton backs away from crow and
		looks at the gun in his hand.  crow opens his eyes, watches
		as anderton finally lowers the gun.
		
		                    anderton
		          you have the right to remain
		          silent.  anything you say can be
		          used against you in a court of law.
		
		crow looks at him.  not what he expected.
		
		                    anderton
		          you have the right to an attorney
		          present now and during any future
		          questioning.  if you cannot afford
		          one, one will be appointed to you. 
		          do you understand these rights?
		
		crow doesn't move, confused.
		
		                    crow
		          you're not gonna kill me?
		
		                    anderton
		          no.
		
		crow still doesn't move.
		
		                    crow
		              (whispering)
		          but you have to.
		              (then)
		          they said you would.
		
		                    anderton
		              (looks at agatha)
		          the precogs were wrong.
		
		                    crow
		          if you don't kill me, my family
		          gets nothing!
		
		anderton pauses, looks back at him as crow comes forward.
		
		                    crow
		          you're supposed to kill me.  he
		          said you would.
		
		                    anderton
		          who said i would?
		
		                    children
		          he called me in prison.  said if i
		          went along, he'd get me released,
		          take care of my family.
		
		                    anderton
		          if you did what?
		
		                    crow
		          acted like i killed your kid.
		
		anderton goes stiff, looks at agatha.
		
		                    crow
		          look, i've put my family through
		          enough misery.  you gotta kill me! 
		          this way i can leave 'em something.
		
		                    anderton
		          crow.  i'm not gonna kill you.
		
		                    crow
		          look, believe me, i know it's hard,
		          but you gotta do it --
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm asking you again, who made you
		          do this?
		
		                    crow
		          i don't know -- i never saw his
		          face.  all i know is, the next day
		          i was out, so the guy must've had
		          juice somewhere.  look, man, you
		          gotta go through with this.
		
		                    anderton
		          what the fuck is going on?
		
		suddenly crow steps forward, grabs the muzzle of anderton's
		gun, holds it up to his own chest.  agatha's eyes roll, she
		holds onto the table for support...
		
		                    agatha
		          anderton --
		
		                    crow
		          kill me!
		
		anderton tries to pull the gun away, but crow hangs on.
		
		                    anderton
		          what about the picture --
		
		                    crow
		          fake.  he gave it to me.  now --
		              (pulling on the gun)
		          -- shoot me, goddammit, before i
		          lose my nerve!
		
		                    anderton
		              (pulls the gun back)
		          tell me, who was it, set this up?
		
		                    crow
		          if i tell you, my family gets
		          nothing.
		
		                    anderton
		          who made you do this?
		
		                    crow
		              (pulls the gun)
		          kill me!
		
		                    anderton
		          tell me!
		
		anderton looks at crow who holds the gun muzzle tight to his
		chest, his eyes imploring anderton to pull the trigger.
		
		                    anderton
		          let go of the gun.
		
		                    crow
		          you're not gonna kill me...
		
		                    anderton
		          good-bye, crow.
		
		anderton turns to go, but crow hold onto the muzzle --
		
		                    crow
		          anderton!  wait -- don't --
		
		crow yanks on the gun, making anderton pull the trigger.  we
		hear a loud boom and anderton turns, sees crow holding the
		gun to his own exploded chest.
		
		                    anderton
		          jesus --
		
		crow looks at anderton, a stupid look on his face.  he
		stumbles backwards towards the window.  anderton moves
		forward and reaches for his shirt as...
		
		                    agatha
		          no!
		
		... now she turns away, framed in the mirror, as crow falls
		through the glass window.
		
		anderton stands there frozen a moment, unable to move or
		think.  we hear someone scream o.s.  anderton looks across
		the way, sees everyone in the building across the street
		watching him.  agatha takes him by the arm...
		
		                    agatha
		          go...
		
		anderton grabs agatha and runs out of the room.
