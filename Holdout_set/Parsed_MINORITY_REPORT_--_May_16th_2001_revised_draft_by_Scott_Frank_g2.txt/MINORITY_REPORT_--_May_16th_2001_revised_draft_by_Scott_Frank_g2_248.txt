		int.  ballroom - night
		
		as burgess, surrounded by autograph seekers, is forced to
		stop and sign their precrime hats... while anderton
		continues.
		
		                    anderton (phone)
		          and without her, there was no
		          precrime.  she's always been the
		          strongest of the three.  and you
		          know that without agatha, you had
		          nothing.  without her, you wouldn't
		          be where you are now, standing
		          there signing autographs...
		
		boom.  burgess stops cold, starts looking around the room. 
		knows anderton is somewhere nearby.
