		ext.  beach cottage - chesapeake bay - day
		
		we see lara, anderton's ex-wife, standing on a ladder,
		painting a weatherbeaten shutter.  she looks older now.  more
		tired than in the images we've seen.
		
		                    voice
		          lara?
		
		she turns and we see danny witwer approaching.  she watches
		him come, climbs down the ladder.
		
		                    witwer
		          my name is danny witwer.  i'm --
		
		                    lara
		          i know who you are.
		
		she walks past him, goes into the cottage.  he looks out at
		the ocean a moment, then follows.
