		int.  inner city - mall - day
		
		as they move through the crowded inner city shopping area. 
		she has trouble keeping up.  she looks ahead, something in
		her eyes, then...
		
		                    agatha
		          can you see the man in the blue
		          suit?
		
		sure enough a man walking by in the other direction is
		wearing a blue suit.
		
		                    agatha
		          he drops his briefcase.
		
		he drops his briefcase, spilling all kinds of papers all over
		the sidewalk, including a newspaper with anderton's photo.
		
		                    agatha
		          a woman in a brown dress is going
		          to come out of the door up ahead.
		
		this happens.
		
		                    agatha
		          wait -- she knows you face.  turn
		          in here.
		
		the woman looks at anderton, squints, but before she can make
		any kind of determination as to who he is and why he looks
		sort of familiar, anderton and the precog have gone into...
		
		a pet shop
		
		they move through the store, jammed with all kinds of
		animals, including foxes and shrieking exotic birds.  they go
		through the back door and come out...
		
		in a different section of the mall
		
		as anderton starts to lead her around a corner, she stops. 
		anderton looks around, sees a precop on the upper level.
		
		                    anderton
		          agatha --
		
		                    agatha
		          can you see the balloon man?
		
		                    anderton
		          what?
		
		precop's pov - from the upper level
		
		as the cop scans the mall.  he's about to spot anderton and
		agatha when a balloon vendor comes around the corner where
		they're waiting and blocks the cops view.  he moves on.
		
		anderton & agatha
		
		start walking again.
		
		                    agatha
		          this way...
		
		she leads him underneath the pedestrian bridge.
		
		                    agatha
		          stop.
		
		we now boom up to the top of the bridge where we see knott
		moving to the side, leaning over the rail and peering down...
		
		on anderton & agatha
		
		she gently pulls anderton further under the bridge so that...
		
		on the bridge - knott
		
		can't see them when he looks down.  they're a foot or two out
		of his sightline.  he then moves to the other side of the
		bridge and peers down as...
		
		agatha
		
		now leads anderton a step or two back the other way, so that
		again...
		
		knott
		
		just misses seeing them.  he moves off across the bridge.
		
		anderton & agatha
		
		hurry through the mall now.
		
		a bum in one of the doorways begs for change.  they walk past
		him...
		
		                    bum
		          may the devil take you as his
		          bride!
		
		a few steps later, agatha stops in front of a door.
		
		                    agatha
		          drop some money.
		
		                    anderton
		          forget that guy --
		
		                    agatha
		          do it.  right here.  on the ground.
		
		anderton reaches into his pocket, drops some change on the
		ground.  agatha looks back at the bum who turns towards them
		upon hearing the sound of the coins hitting the ground.  she
		then leads anderton off...
		
		                    bum
		          may god bless you!
		
		the bum comes over, bends down in front of a door just as it
		opens into him, knocking him over, and two precops burst out
		and topple over him.
