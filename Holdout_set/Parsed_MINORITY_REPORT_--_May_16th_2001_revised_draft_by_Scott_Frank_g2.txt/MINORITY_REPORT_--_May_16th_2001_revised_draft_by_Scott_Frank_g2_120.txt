		int.  a room - night
		
		where an old woman sits eating a bowl of soup.  she looks up
		as the spyder comes clicking across the floor towards her. 
		she knows the drill, keeps a calm eye on the spyder as she
		eats her dinner, holding out a leg for the spyder to climb
		up.
		
		                    old woman
		          nice to have some company...
		
		the spyder climbs up the woman, up her arm and across her
		shoulder.  it grips her cheek lightly as the eyedentiscan
		reads her eyes...
		
		                    old woman
		          see my new earrings?  my grandson
		          gave them to me.  he's in beauty
		          school --
		
		the spyder beeps as it reads her --
