		ext.  precrime building - day
		
		as anderton moves away from the group to a side entrance
		where precrime personnel enter.  he pulls off the overcoat as
		he goes so that we now read the word maintenance on the back
		of his coveralls.  he goes inside the building, into...
		
		a maintenance area
		
		anderton emerges pushing an ultrasonic scrubber.  he turns up
		one corridor, then another.  he walks to a door marked
		nutrient room and looks both ways.  he pulls a small, black
		ziploc-like bag from his pocket and opens it.
		
		and now, wincing, he very gingerly removes his two old eyes
		from the bag.  one of the eyes slips from his hands...
		
		                    anderton
		          oh, no...
		
		then the other one slips.
		
		                    anderton
		          no... no... no...
		
		he carefully avoids stepping on them as he awkwardly scoops
		them up off the floor.
		
		he then glances about, and now, holding one eye in each hand,
		he very very very carefully holds them up to the eyedentiscan
		and prays...
		
		after the world's longest beat, he gets cleared and quickly
		drops his eyeballs back into the bag and enters the secured
		area.
