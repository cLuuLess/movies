		int.  new metro - day
		
		reaching the bottom of the escalators, anderton spots two
		metro cops talking to a homeless man.  he veers around them,
		making it across the platform to the train, which is just
		arriving.
		
		he pushes his way on with the other passengers.  as the doors
		close, an eye-dent scanner sweeps through the cabin -- that's
		how the system bills citizens for using the train.  anderton
		tries to look away, but it's impossible to avoid.
