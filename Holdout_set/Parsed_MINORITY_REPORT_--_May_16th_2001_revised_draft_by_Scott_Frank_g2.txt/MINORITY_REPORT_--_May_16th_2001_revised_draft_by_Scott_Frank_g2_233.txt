		int.  lamar burgess' office - day
		
		as lara is greet by burgess in a white t-shirt and slacks, no
		shoes -- in the middle of getting dressed.  he embraces her.
		
		                    burgess
		          this is all my fault.
		
		                    lara
		          no, it isn't, lamar.  there was
		          nothing anyone could do.
		
		she sits on the couch, a box of anderton's belongings on the
		coffee table in front of her.
		
		                    burgess
		          i thought you might want to have
		          those.
		
		he moves to a mirror, starts to put on his precrime dress
		uniform shirt.
		
		                    burgess
		          i haven't worn this damn thing in
		          years.  i just wanted to make sure
		          it fits before tonight.
		
		                    lara
		          you look great.
		
		he watches in the mirror as she lifts john's .45 out of the
		box.
		
		                    burgess
		          i knew he was having trouble for
		          some time, and yet i did nothing
		          about it.
		
		lara is about to say something when burgess' secretary sticks
		her head in...
		
		                    secretary
		          the guy from usa today is here.
		
		                    burgess
		          tell him not now.
		
		                    secretary
		          he just wanted a few minutes
		          before --
		
		                    burgess
		          not.  now.
		
		the secretary exits.  burgess buttons his shirt.
		
		                    burgess
		          it's insanity around here.
		
		                    lara
		          i thought you were retiring?
		
		                    burgess
		          i was, but this whole incident with
		          john made me realize the fragility
		          of what we've built here.  this is
		          john's legacy as much as mine and i
		          want to protect that.
		
		he looks at her.
		
		                    burgess
		          i know how hard this all is for
		          you, but you can at least find some
		          comfort in the fact that john
		          finally found the man who killed
		          your son.
		
		she looks at him, thinks about what he just said, watching as
		he pins his precrime badge to his shirt.
		
		                    lara
		          who's anne lively?
		
		he pokes himself with the pin, winces.
		
		                    burgess
		          who?
		
		                    lara
		          anne lively.  john was talking
		          about her right before they took
		          him.
		
		                    burgess
		          i don't know who that is.
		
		burgess doesn't say anything.  the news keeps getting worse.
		
		                    lara
		          john said something about him being
		          set up because he "found out about
		          her."
		
		                    burgess
		          we know why john was tagged.
		
		                    lara
		          he also said crow was a fake.
		
		burgess looks at her.
		
		                    burgess
		          and witwer?  he was shot with
		          john's gun inside john's apartment.
		
		she looks back at burgess a moment, then:
		
		                    lara
		          lamar, do you know the reason why
		          john came here to work with you?
		
		                    burgess
		          sean --
		
		                    lara
		          no.  that's what everyone thinks.
		              (then)
		          john shot a man dead in baltimore
		          six months before.
		
		she lets burgess react to that, then...
		
		                    lara
		          he was serving a warrant on a
		          murder suspect when the guy opened
		          fire from inside.  it was a good
		          shooting.  the department gave john
		          a commendation for it.  but john
		          couldn't let it go.  he'd say the
		          man's name in his sleep.  he didn't
		          eat.  it was all he talked about. 
		          it was all he thought about.  he
		          came to work for you because he
		          thought if he could just stop that
		          kind of thing from happening...
		
		she takes a breath, tries to control herself.
		
		                    burgess
		          i understand.
		
		                    lara
		          no.  i don't think you do.
		              (then)
		          the other day, when he came to the
		          cottage, he talked about a lot of
		          things, but danny witwer, the man
		          he was supposed to have just
		          killed?  he didn't mention him.  he
		          didn't say his name even once.
		
		burgess looks at her, then takes her hand and sighs.
		
		                    burgess
		          lara, john was the best cop i ever
		          knew, and in some ways, the best
		          man.  but the scars he carried
		          around, well...
		              (shakes his head)
		          i know that he'd want us to honor
		          the good things we remember about
		          him.
		
		she keeps looking at him.  he smiles.
		
		                    burgess
		          but i also know why he married you:
		          you're as stubborn as he is.
		
		                    lara
		          lamar --
		
		                    burgess
		          all right.  tell you what i'll do. 
		          first thing monday, i'll look over
		          the witwer evidence and i'll have
		          gideon run the containment files,
		          see if anyone drowned a woman named
		          -- what did you say her name was?
		
		                    lara
		              (beat)
		          anne lively... but i never said she
		          drowned.
		
		burgess looks at her, his expression slowly going icy as his
		secretary once more reappears.
		
		                    secretary
		          sir, the press conference is
		          starting.
		
		                    burgess
		              (looking at lara)
		          i'll be right there.
		
		the secretary backs out of the room.  burgess moves to lara. 
		she flinches slightly as he reaches past her head, and grabs
		his hat from the back of the couch.
		
		                    burgess
		          we'll talk about this later.
		              (kisses her)
		          i'll come by the cottage.
		
		he walks out, leaving her there on the couch.  she looks
		around the office, then at john's .45 sitting on the table.
