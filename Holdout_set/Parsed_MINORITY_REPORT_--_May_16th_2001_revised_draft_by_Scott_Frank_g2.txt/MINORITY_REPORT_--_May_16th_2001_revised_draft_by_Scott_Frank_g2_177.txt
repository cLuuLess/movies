		int.  lexus - day
		
		agatha leans out the window, experiencing the world outside
		for the first time in years.  a group of teenagers walking
		by.  a woman pushing a baby in a pram.
		
		a man walking a dog.  the dog turns to agatha, now trying to
		pull his master over to her...
		
		she turns to the street and watches people going by on
		bicycles and inside other vehicles.
		
		but for agatha, it is not a peaceful scene at all.  she sees
		only death, pain and suffering.  the world is overwhelming.
		
		she turns away, watches as raindrops fall on the windshield. 
		she rolls down the window and sticks her head out to feel the
		rain.
		
		she listens to the now-soothing sounds of the rain mixed with
		laughter mixed with the baby crying mixed with the snippets
		of conversation she hears all around her.  then:
		
		we hear a jackhammer
		
		and agatha turns to a construction site across the way.  a
		huge building is going up.
		
		a crane hoists a bundle of steal girders up to the top of the
		site.
		
		a teenage boy walks to a bicycle locked to a fence in front
		of the site.  she closes her eyes and shudders, then sits up,
		steels herself and calls to the boy...
		
		                    agatha
		              (barely)
		          nathan --
		
		the boy keeps going.
		
		                    agatha
		              (tries again, louder)
		          nathan!
		
		the teenage boy stops as he gets to the bike, looks at her.
		
		                    agatha
		          come here.
		
		the boy sees this pretty face inside a vehicle beckoning him,
		looks around to make sure she meant him, then comes over.
		
		                    boy/nathan
		          do i know you?
		
		                    agatha
		          hold my hand.
		
		as she reaches for him, nathan sees she must be blind.
		
		                    nathan
		          what?
		
		                    agatha
		          please, nathan, hold my hand.
		
		the teenager sees she's only wearing anderton's jacket...
		
		                    nathan
		          whoa --
		
		agatha reaches out and takes his hand and holds onto it. 
		something pulses through him.  he looks at her, afraid...
		
		                    nathan
		          who are you?
