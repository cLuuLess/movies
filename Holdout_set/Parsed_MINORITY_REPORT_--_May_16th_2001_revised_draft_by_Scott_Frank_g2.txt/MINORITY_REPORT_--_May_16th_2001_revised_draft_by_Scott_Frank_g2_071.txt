		int.  precrime analytical room - day
		
		as anderton comes in, jad sits at the big screen, looking at
		something.
		
		                    anderton
		          jad.  how come you're not out there
		          with father witwer?
		
		                    jad
		          we're in motion on something.
		
		anderton comes over now.
		
		                    jad
		          from what i can see, we got a white
		          male, about five-eight,
		          approximately one-forty, takes a
		          round in the ten ring, and goes out
		          a window.
		
		anderton starts to put on his eyepiece and finger gloves.
		
		                    anderton
		          red ball?
		
		                    jad
		          nope.  somebody's thinking about
		          this one.
		
		                    anderton
		          amazing there's someone within two
		          hundred miles actually dumb enough
		          to still do that.
		
		jad watches as anderton sticks a disc into a slot and we hear
		classical music over.
		
		                    jad
		          i love this part.
		
		anderton starts "conducting" the prevision, organizing the
		images, moving some up, others back...
		
		                    female precog
		          wait!  don't --
		
		anderton looks at the precog screen, sees the three of them
		writhing about.
		
		                    anderton
		          here we go...
		
		and now we see the screen, various images, all of them
		grainy, visual non-sequiters like a face wearing
		sunglasses... the number 9 turning into the number 6... the
		inside of a small apartment... a figure backlit by a
		window... a cracked mirror... a small man... a pair of dark
		eyes...
		
		                    anderton
		          shunt all cycles to a full vis
		          correlation at my mark by the
		          windows.
		
		and now the image starts to resolve, showing two men, one
		with a gun, his image still blurred.  the other clearer...
		
		on the chute: a ball
		
		rolls down.  jad moves into read the name:
		
		                    jad
		          the victim's name is leo crow.
		
		                    anderton
		              (into the computer)
		          start a location run and a contact
		          search for future victim leo crow.
		              (to jad)
		          and, jad, i'll need a last known
		          sheet when you get it.
		
		                    jad
		          i've got no address -- last known
		          or otherwise -- no tax returns for
		          the last five years.
		
		                    anderton
		          check ncic, maybe he's got a
		          record.  then send a protection
		          team as soon as we lock the
		          location.
		
		anderton turns to another part of the screen...
		
		                    anderton
		          case #1109, previsualized by the
		          precogs and recorded on holosphere
		          by precrime's q-stacks.
		              (to a screen)
		          my fellow witnesses for case #1109
		          are dr. katherine james and chief
		          justice frank pollard.
		
		and now the split-image emerges of james and pollard in the
		respective offices.
		
		                    anderton
		          are the witnesses ready to preview
		          and validate #1109?
		
		                    pollard
		              (a mouthful of dinner)
		          ready when you are, john.
		
		                    james
		          standing by.
		
		on the screen in front of jad we see mugshots rolling by. 
		drivers license photos... a mass of photo id data... anderton
		zooms into a clock in the room.  3:06 p.m.  fri.
		
		                    anderton
		          i show time of occurrence, friday
		          at fifteen-zero-six hours.
		
		                    jad
		          that was easy.
		
		anderton sets his timer for 28 hours, thirty-one minutes.
		
		                    anderton
		          confirm with trig and image.
		
		                    jad
		          any id on the shooter yet?
		
		                    anderton
		          still scrubbing... looks like
		          there's a third party, somebody
		          wearing shades just out the
		          window...
		
		anderton zooms in on the face with the sunglasses, then pans
		over and tries to get a clearer picture of the gunman. 
		his image starting to come into focus as he turns.  it's
		slow, jerky, so they don't immediately recognize the face
		as...
		
		                    anderton
		          jesus...
		
		his own face.  and now anderton watches horrified as on the
		screen he shoots the man we now know as leo crow...
		
		                    anderton
		          okay, very funny.
		
		anderton looks at jad, absorbed in his photo id array.  jad
		notices him, looks over.
		
		                    jad
		          you say something, chief?
		
		on the chute: the ball
		
		with the killer's name on it: john anderton
		
		anderton stares at the ball.  we hear laughter o.s.  he looks
		through at the baby shower, witwer looking his way.
		
		                    anderton
		              (panic rising)
		          uh, yeah, you mind getting me a
		          piece of that cake they're eating
		          down there?  i'm starving.
		
		                    jad
		          sure, chief.  i think i'll grab one
		          for myself while i'm at it...
		
		                    anderton
		          take your time.
		
		jad goes, passing behind anderton, who quickly changes his
		screen so jad won't see his face as the killer.
		
		alone in the room now, anderton begins zooming in on the odd
		details of the vision once more.  the face with the
		sunglasses just outside the window.  the number 6 turning
		into a number 9.  a cracked mirror.  anderton shooting the
		man...
		
		he zooms back in on his face.  there's an air of desperation
		on the anderton he sees on screen.  it's like looking at a
		stranger.
