		agatha looks up at nathan, into his eyes, who tries to pull
		his hand away.
		
		                    nathan
		          look, whoever you are --
		
		we hear someone shout and the teenager boy wheels around
		as...
		
		a steel beam
		
		falls from the construction site, landing directly on
		nathan's bicycle.  nathan stares in horror at where he would
		have been had he not come over to agatha.  she lets go of his
		hand.
		
		                    agatha
		          you can go now.
		
		anderton comes out of the store, looks at the crushed bike, a
		crowd gathering around it.  oblivious to what's just
		happened, he walks past the stunned kid.
		
		                    anderton
		          excuse me.
