		int.  anderton's office - day
		
		witwer sits at the desk screen studying the different images
		from the prevision of anderton murdering leo crow:
		
		anderton holding the gun.  the shadowy figure of leo crow by
		the window.  the face in sunglasses outside the window.
		
		he then pans about the room: a bed.  a table.  a mirror. 
		there's anderton.  wait -- he goes back to the mirror.  he
		leans close to the screen.  pushes in.  and now we see it: a
		figure standing in the mirror.  blurry.  but there.
