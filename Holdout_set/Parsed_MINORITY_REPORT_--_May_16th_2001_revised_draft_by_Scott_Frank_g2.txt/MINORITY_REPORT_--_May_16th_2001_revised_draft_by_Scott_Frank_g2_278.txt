		ext.  hotel terrace - night
		
		with nowhere else to go, anderton stands at the balcony.  his
		hood is off exposing his shaved head.
		
		                    anderton
		          what are you gonna do now?
		
		he turns, sees burgess standing in the doorway, holding the
		gun on him.  anderton looks off at the skyline.  we see a
		blinking red light moving towards us over the city...
		
		                    anderton
		          no doubt the precogs have already
		          seen this.
		
		                    burgess
		              (seeing the red light)
		          no doubt.
		
		                    anderton
