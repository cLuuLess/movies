		int.  apartment - a kid's bedroom - day
		
		a kid looks up from his homework as the hoverpack fizzes out
		and knott and anderton go at it on the floor, anderton taking
		knott out with the kid's hockey stick.
		
		the other cops come flying in and anderton takes off running. 
		the cops in their hoverpacks get stuck in the door.  a dazed
		knott is the last one to get up, while behind him, we see the
		kid shove knott's abandoned hoverpack under his bed...
