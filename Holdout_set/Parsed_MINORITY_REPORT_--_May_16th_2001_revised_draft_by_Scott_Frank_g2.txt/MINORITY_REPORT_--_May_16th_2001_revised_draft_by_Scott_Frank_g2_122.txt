		int.  anderton's room - night
		
		anderton sits in the chair, listening now to the muffled
		arguing next door.  suddenly, the voices stop.  anderton
		turns his face toward the wall...
		
		silence.  then we hear bouncing bedsprings as the couple next
		door starts to go at it.  he shakes his head.
