		ext.  the gardens - day
		
		as anderton jumps to the ground.  his shirt is ripped; his
		arms scratched from what he realizes are thorns embedded in
		the vines.
		
		we hear rustling as, behind anderton, several of the plants
		unfurl to their full dimensions of eight feet and wrap their
		vines around anderton's neck and torso.
		
		he breaks free.  we hear classical music o.s. and anderton
		moves through the gardens towards it.  he stops, dizzy,
		touches his forehead and then looks off at...
		
		a greenhouse
		
		where we see a woman, 50, dressed in a wide-brimmed hat and
		gardening attire, attending to the plants, gently spraying,
		then wiping each leaf with a small, square cloth...
		
		anderton staggers into the greenhouse, something now quite
		wrong with him.
		
		                    anderton
		          dr. hineman --
		
		quick as a flash she holds up her cane and a six-inch blade
		extends from the tip to anderton's throat.  she looks down
		the length of it at anderton, his ripped clothing, bruised
		face, and scratched arms.
		
		                    iris
		          you're trespassing.
		
		he starts to sway, touches his forehead.
		
		                    iris
		          something wrong?
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm a little dizzy...
		
		she casually leans on the cane, shoving the blade back up
		inside.
		
		                    iris
		          yes, i'm afraid that would be from
		          the doll's eye.
		
		                    anderton
		          the what?
		
		                    iris
		          the vine -- the baneberry that
		          scratched you during your illegal
		          climb over my wall...
		
		she leads anderton over to a wooden table just inside the
		greenhouse where she's got afternoon tea set up.
		
		                    iris
		          it's not a true doll's eye, of
		          course, but a little hybrid of my
		          own design.
		
		anderton staggers, grabs hold of the table for support.
		
		                    iris
		          it's quite something, once the
		          poison gets into your bloodstream,
		          you'll start to see what i can only
		          describe as the most extraordinary
		          display of blue objects.
		
		anderton struggles.  she watches him a moment.
		
		                    iris
		          this just isn't your week, is it,
		          chief?
		
		he pulls his gun.  she shakes her head...
		
		                    iris
		          now now...
		
		she easily takes it away from him, jacks the clip onto the
		table, then calmly pours a cup of tea.
		
		                    iris
		          you have three minutes to tell me
		          what you're doing here before i
		          feed you to a few of my more
		          predacious plants.
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm... not... a... killer.
		
		she studies him a moment, then tears a leaf from a plant, and
		calmly begins crumpling it up into the tea...
		
		                    iris
		          you better drink this.  soon you
		          won't be able to swallow, and then
		          you'll be totally buggered.
		
		he looks at the cup, hesitates, tries to pick it up.
		
		                    iris
		          drink all of it.
		
		she pours the rest into his mouth.  he sits back, waits for
		the antidote to take effect.
		
		                    iris
		          take a moment to right yourself.
		
		she picks up some pruning shears and goes to work on an
		orchid.
		
		                    iris
		          just what is it you think i can do
		          for you?
		
		                    anderton
		          you can tell me how someone...
		          could fake a prevision.
		
		                    iris
		          and how would i know that?
		
		he looks at her.
		
		                    anderton
		          you invented precrime.
		
		she chuckles bitterly at that one.
		
		                    anderton
		          what's so funny?
		
		                    iris
		          if the unintended consequences of a
		          series of genetic mistakes and
		          science gone haywire can be called
		          invention, then yes, i invented
		          precrime.
		
		                    anderton
		          you don't seem all that proud.
		
		                    iris
		          i'm not.  i was trying to heal
		          them, not turn them into...
		          something else.
		
		                    anderton
		          heal who?
		
		                    iris
		          the innocents we now use to stop
		          the guilty.
		
		                    anderton
		          you're talking about the precogs...
		
		                    iris
		          you think the three in the tank
		          come from a test tube?  they're
		          merely the ones who survived.
		
		she sits down, pours herself some tea.
		
		                    iris
		          i was doing genetic research at the
		          woodhaven clinic in rhode island on
		          renning's syndrome, a neurological
		          condition that affects the cerebral
		          cortex of children.  most of these
		          kids were abandoned or forgotten. 
		          very few of the kids lived past the
		          age of twelve.
		
		she looks away, remembering it all now...
		
		                    iris
		          it began as play.  a guessing game
		          like you play with any toddler,
		          except these children always
		          guessed right.
		              (then)
		          and then the nightmares started. 
		          they were all different, but all
		          the same.  they were all about
		          murder.  and the murders were all
		          happening.
		
		                    anderton
		          and how did lamar become involved?
		
		                    iris
		          back then, he was still a da, and
		          quite a few parents of my patients
		          had passed through his courtroom. 
		          you have to understand, these
		          people were the dregs of society. 
		          but once they saw their children...
		          he decided he would do whatever he
		          could for them.  he's that way, you
		          know, paternal about certain
		          things.  precrime.  the precogs. 
		          you.
		
		                    anderton
		              (keeping her on track)
		          you say some of the children died?
		
		                    iris
		          so many of them... despite what we
		          did for them.  or maybe because of
		          what we did to them.
		              (then, bitter)
		          it doesn't matter.  it's a perfect
		          system now, isn't it?
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm not a murderer.  i've never
		          even met the man i'm supposed to
		          kill.
		
		                    iris
		          and, yet, a chain of events has
		          started.  a chain that will lead
		          inexorably to his death.
		
		                    anderton
		          not if i stay away from him.
		
		                    iris
		          how can you avoid a man you've
		          never met?
		
		                    anderton
		          so you won't help me?
		
		                    iris
		          i can't help you.  no one can.  the
		          precogs are never wrong.
		
		he turns away, looking lost.  she picks up her tea cup, looks
		at him over the top.
		
		                    iris
		          but, occasionally, they do
		          disagree.
		
		he turns back to her.  she casually sips her tea.
		
		                    anderton
		          what?
		
		                    iris
		          most of the time, all three
		          precognitives will see an event in
		          the same way.  but once in a while,
		          one of them will see things
		          differently than the other two.
		
		                    anderton
		          jesus christ -- why didn't i know
		          about this?
		
		                    iris
		          because these minority reports are
		          destroyed the instant they occur.
		
		                    anderton
		          why?
		
		                    iris
		          obviously, for precrime to
		          function, there can't be any
		          suggestion of fallibility.  after
		          all, what good is a justice system
		          that instills doubt?  it may be
		          reasonable, but it's still doubt.
		
		anderton tries to take all of this in, looks at her.
		
		                    anderton
		          you're saying that i've halo'd
		          innocent people?
		
		                    iris
		          i'm saying that every so often
		          those accused of a precrime might,
		          just might, have an alternate
		          future.
		
		                    anderton
		          does burgess know about this? 
		          about the minority report?
		
		                    iris
		              (beat)
		          i used to joke with lamar that we
		          were the mother and father of
		          precrime.  well, in my experience,
		          parents often see their children as
		          they want them to be, not as they
		          are.
		
		                    anderton
		          answer my question.  did lamar
		          burgess know about the minority
		          report?
		
		                    iris
		          yes, of course, he knew, but at the
		          time, he felt -- we both felt their
		          existence was... an insignificant
		          variable.
		
		                    anderton
		          insignificant to you maybe, but
		          what about those people i put away
		          with alternate futures?  my god, if
		          the country knew there was a chance
		          they might not --
		
		                    iris
		          the system would collapse.
		
		                    anderton
		          i believe in that system...
		
		                    iris
		          do you?  really?
		
		he looks at her.
		
		                    anderton
		          you want to bring it down.
		
		                    iris
		          but you will bring it down if you
		          kill leo crow.
		              (she relishes the thought)
		          why, that will be the most
		          spectacular public display of how
		          precrime... didn't work.  
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm not gonna kill anybody.
		
		                    iris
		          hold that thought.
		
		                    anderton
		          why should i trust you?
		
		                    iris
		          you shouldn't.  you shouldn't trust
		          anyone... certainly not the
		          attorney general who wants it all
		          for himself.  not the young federal
		          agent who wants your job.  not even
		          the old man who just wants to hang
		          onto what he's created.  don't
		          trust anyone.
		              (then)
		          just find the minority report.
		
		                    anderton
		          you said they're destroyed.
		
		                    iris
		          i said the record is destroyed. 
		          the original report exists for all
		          time.
		              (then)
		          i designed the system so that
		          whenever a report occurred, it
		          would be stored in a safe place --
		          but not declared.
		
		                    anderton
		          what safe place is that?
		
		                    iris
		          the safest place of all.
		
		anderton grabs her hand as she reaches once more for her
		teacup, spilling it.
		
		                    anderton
		          where?
		
		                    iris
		          inside the precog who predicted it.
		              (then)
		          all you have to do is download it.
		
		                    anderton
		          that's all, huh?  just walk right
		          into precrime, go into the temple,
		          somehow tap into the precogs, and
		          then download this minority
		          report...
		
		                    iris
		          if... you have one.
		
		                    anderton
		          -- and then walk out.
		
		                    iris
		          actually, i think you'll have to
		          run out, but yes, that's what you
		          have to do.  
		
		                    anderton
		          you're insane or you think i am.
		
		she shrugs.
		
		                    anderton
		          i'll get eyescanned a dozen times
		          before i get within ten miles of
		          precrime.  they'll pick me up...
		
		                    iris
		              (looks at him)
		          sometimes in order to see the
		          light, you have to risk the dark.
		
		he looks back at her.
		
		                    iris
		          as a policeman -- excuse me, a
		          former policeman -- i'm sure you
		          know all sorts of people who
		          could... help you out in this
		          regard.
		
		anderton sits there thinking about what she's suggesting. 
		she gets up, moves to one of her plants, starts feeding it
		with a sprayer.  she reaches out and takes a long vine in her
		hand and strokes it...
		
		                    iris
		          it's funny how all living organisms
		          are alike.  when the chips are
		          down...
		              (she grips the vine)
		          when the pressure is on...
		              (squeezes it tighter)
		          ... every creature on the face of
		          the earth is interested in one
		          thing and one thing only:
		
		the vine suddenly whips out of her hand.
		
		                    iris
		          it's own survival.
		
		she looks at anderton.
		
		                    iris
		          find the minority report.
		
		anderton sees that her palm is now bleeding from the vine. 
		she smiles, takes out a handkerchief and wraps her hand.
		
		she then turns her back on him and faces her plants.
		
		                    anderton
		          how do i even know which one has
		          it?
		
		                    iris
		          it's always in the more gifted of
		          the three.
		
		                    anderton
		          which one is that?
		
		                    iris
		              (isn't it obvious)
		          the female.
		
		she picks up her cane and turns the music back on, leaving
		anderton to ponder this.
		
		                                                  cut to:
		
		the anderton prevision
		
		the series of images we saw earlier: a man backlit by a
		window.  a face wearing sunglasses outside the window.  "6"
		becoming "9".  a gun goes off.  a man flying through the
		window.  we're zooming in and out.  panning this way and that
		now we...
		
		reveal: anderton's office - precrime
		
		as fletcher works the prevision screen in here, witwer looks
		around the office.  he pulls open a drawer.  it's empty.
		
		                    jad (o.s.)
		          he wasn't in here much.  he
		          preferred to be with the team.
		
		witwer looks to where jad stands in the doorway.  witwer
		notices something above jad's head.  a laser projector. 
		witwer looks around, sees a jacket covering a piece of
		equipment on the bookshelf.  knott comes into the room.
		
		                    knott
		          you seen the latest polls?  we're
		          dead even.
		
		he sits on anderton's desk, knocking over a photograph of
		anderton, his wife, and son.
		
		                    knott
		          even since chief america ran away,
		          the numbers for precrime have been
		          goin' up.
		              (looks at fletcher)
		          people feel better, they know we're
		          willing to go after one of our own.
		
		                    jad
		          more likely, people just want a
		          show like this every week.
		
		fletcher calmly rights the photograph, indicates the screen.
		
		                    fletcher
		          here's where we're at.  three men
		          in a room.  the victims here. 
		          anderton here, and this
		          unidentified male out the window. 
		          the exterior of the adjacent
		          building suggests public housing,
		          but i can't make out the location. 
		          government architecture is
		          modern/conformist which means --
		
		                    witwer
		          there's thousands of units like
		          this one.
		
		                    fletcher
		              (nods)
		          they're everywhere.
		
		witwer looks at the photograph of anderton, sean and lara.
		
		                    witwer
		          but he doesn't go there to kill
		          crow for another twenty-two hours. 
		          in the meantime, i'm betting he's
		          somewhere in the sprawl.
		
		jad and fletcher exchange looks.
		
		                    witwer
		          anderton's smart enough to go where
		          electronic billboards and other
		          media can't id him to pick his
		          pocket.  there's fewer consumers
		          down there, which means fewer
		          scanners to target him.
		
		                    fletcher
		          no offense, sir, but why wouldn't
		          he just run?
		
		                    witwer
		          because he thinks he's innocent.
		
		witwer pulls the jacket off and we see a holo-computer like
		the one anderton has at home.
		
		                    witwer
		          we concentrate on the sprawl.  we
		          do overflies in ships with two
		          spyder teams on the ground.  go
		          building by building.  thermal scan
		          the whole area, read anything with
		          eyes and a heartbeat.
		
		witwer switches the computer on and we see an image of lara
		in a evening gown opening a present...
		
		                    lara
		          john -- stop filming me.
		
		witwer watches as lara, looks up at us, her face beautiful.
		
		                    witwer
		          where is she?
