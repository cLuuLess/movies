		int.  suburban d.c. kitchen - morning
		
		we hear birds chirping, someone humming softly, then...
		
		                    a women's voice
		          breakfast!
		
		sarah, the woman we just saw murdered, cooks breakfast,
		bathed in a halo of bright sunshine that streams in from a
		window.  she looks up, smiles.  a beautiful day outside.
		
		                    voice
		          for score and seven years ago our
		          fathers brought forth on this,
		          um...
		
		she sets two plates of scrambled eggs down on the table where
		her son -- 10 -- sits reciting the gettysburg address as he
		cuts out a cardboard mask with a pair of scissors, poking
		through lincoln's eyes to make holes he can see through.
		
		                    sarah
		          continent...
		
		                    son
		          continent.  a new nation, conceived
		          in liberty...
		
		                    sarah
		          howard?!  breakfast!
