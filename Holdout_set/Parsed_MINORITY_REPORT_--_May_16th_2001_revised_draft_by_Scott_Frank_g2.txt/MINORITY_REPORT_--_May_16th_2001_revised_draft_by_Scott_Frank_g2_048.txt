		int.  bedroom - morning
		
		as sarah opens her eyes, sees howard standing there over the
		shoulder of her lover and gasps.
		
		                    sarah
		          howard --
		
		                    howard
		          i forgot my glasses.
		
		the lover rolls off of her and sits up.
		
		                    howard
		          you know how blind i am without
		          them.
		
		she sees the scissors in his hand.  screams.  he's bringing
		them down when, suddenly, the hand holding the scissors is
		grabbed by anderton...
		
		                    howard
		          what --
		
		tight on their two hands
		
		as anderton's watch beeps as it counts down the last second
		and now...
		
		... the skylight overhead explodes, wood and glass flying
		everywhere as the other precops descend from the hovership,
		drop straight into the room.
		
		a floating camera bot pushes past anderton to the center of
		the room.
		
		camera bot - pov
		
		grids and vectors place and locate everyone in the room.  a
		screen-within-a-screen zooms in on the scissors.  it films
		sarah's lover as he comes away from the bed.
		
		                    anderton
		          mr. marks, you're under arrest  
		          for --
		
		howard makes a run for the door...
		
		                    anderton
		          knott --
		
		knott grabs him, but the man puts up a fight.
		
		anderton takes a hand-held device from his belt (a spyder)
		and scans marks' retina.
		
		                    anderton
		          positive for howard marks --
		
		howard stands frozen, mouth agape as he now fully sees the
		precrime ship hovering right out the window.
		
		                    anderton
		          by mandate of the district of
		          columbia precrime division, i'm
		          placing you under arrest for the
		          future murder of sarah marks and
		          donald doobin that was to take
		          place today, april 22, at oh-eight
		          hundred hours, four minutes --
		
		                    sarah
		          what?
		
		                    howard
		          i didn't do anything!  sarah!
		
		                    anderton
		              (to fletcher)
		          give the man his hat.
		
		and now the other team members grab hold of howard and start
		to shave his head with an electric sheer right there on the
		stairs, his hair falling in clumps to the floor below.
		
		                    howard
		          oh, god.  don't put the halo on me!
		
		and now fletcher steps forward with what is essentially a
		metal halo.  fletcher places it on howard's head while he
		screams...
		
		                    howard
		          i wasn't going to do it!  i wasn't
		          going to hurt her!  i just wanted
		          to scare her!
		
		as the halo is fitted onto his head, howard's body arches in
		a convulsive shock, his eyes rolling white into his head as
		he finally goes limp.
