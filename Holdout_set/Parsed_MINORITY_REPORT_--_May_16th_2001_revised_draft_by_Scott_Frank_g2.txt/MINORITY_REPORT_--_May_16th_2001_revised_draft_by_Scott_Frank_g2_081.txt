		int.  anderton's car - day
		
		burgess appears on the windshield screen.
		
		                    anderton
		          just so you know, i've overridden
		          the vehicle locator.  i just wanted
		          to talk to you before justice --
		
		                    burgess
		          justice already knows.  talk to me,
		          john.  tell me what's happening?
		
		                    anderton
		          this is all witwer.  he's setting
		          me up.
		
		                    burgess
		          stop.  just wait.  who's the
		          victim?
		
		                    anderton
		          somebody named leo crow.
		
		                    burgess
		          and who the hell is that?
		
		                    anderton
		          i have no idea.  i've never heard
		          of him.  but i'm supposed to kill
		          him in less than thirty-six hours.
		
		                    burgess
		          all right, john, just take a
		          breath, let's think about this...
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm out of breath!  i'm a fucking
		          fugitive!
		
		                    burgess
		          then come to my house.  we'll
		          talk -- 
		
		                    anderton
		          i can't.  they're following me
		          right now.  they'll meet me there. 
		          they'll halo me.
		
		                    burgess
		          how could witwer have accessed the
		          case file?
		
		                    anderton
		          can you fake the cerebral output?
		
		                    burgess
		          we're years from that.  john, i'm
		          asking you: please, come in, we'll
		          shut down the system until we get
		          this thing figured out.
		
		                    anderton
		          you know i can't do that.  you
		          can't do that...
		              (then)
		          lamar, i need you to talk to wally,
		          see if witwer's gone inside the
		          temple again.  then ask jad for any
		          off hour eyedents into the
		          analytical room --
		
		                    burgess
		          john.  just tell me, who's leo
		          crow?
		
		suddenly, anderton's doors lock tight.
		
		                    computer voice
		          security lockdown enabled.
		
		                    anderton
		          jesus, you don't believe me.
		
		anderton looks up at his windshield display which now shows
		that his vehicle has been rerouted...
		
		                    computer voice
		          revised destination: office.
		
		anderton starts trying to figure a way out of the car.
		
		                    burgess
		          john.  please.  listen to me --
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm not getting halo'd.
		
		                    burgess
		          you can't run --
		
		                    anderton
		          everybody runs.
		
		leaning back, he kicks through the windshield, breaking his
		way out.
