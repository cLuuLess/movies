		ext.  street - day
		
		as agatha and anderton walk along the street.  behind them
		the way is blocked off with buildings.  there's only one way
		out: straight ahead.  they start for it.
		
		suddenly knott comes out of a building in front of them and
		starts walking in front of them.  anderton starts to turn
		around... agatha pulls on his arm.
		
		                    agatha
		          no.  follow him.
		
		                    anderton
		          he'll turn around.
		
		                    agatha
		          he won't.
		
		anderton and agatha walk past a large metal gate, she stops. 
		knott slows down ahead of them, starts to look this way and
		that.  anderton starts to back away...
		
		                    anderton
		          agatha...
		
		                    agatha
		          wait.
		
		we hear a bell ring and suddenly the gate opens, and a beat
		later, kids swarm out of a school.  knott turns around, is
		about to spot them when...
		
		                    agatha
		          can you see his shoe?
		
		in front of them one of the kids trips over his shoe laces.
		
		                    agatha
		          tie his shoe.
		
		anderton drops down to help him, agatha does the same so
		that...
		
		knott sees nothing but a swarm of kids.
		
		                    knott
		              (into his radio)
		          he's not here.  i'll check one
		          block east.
		
		knott moves off across the street.  anderton smiles at the
		kid as he helps him with his shoe...
		
		                    anderton
		          here you go, buddy...
		
		                    kid
		          i can do it myself!
		
		anderton finishes tying the kid's shoe, stays low as a
		teacher ushers the kids off, revealing: part of a giant face
		wearing sunglasses.
		
		anderton slowly stands up, looks at a billboard, spinning in
		the wind as it's hoisted upward by a giant crane, it spins
		around, we see that it's for revo -- on it is a huge grinning
		face wearing sunglasses.  anderton turns and looks at...
		
		an old hotel
		
		a dozen stories up, workmen motion for the crane operator to
		hold up as they continue to get the steel frame prepared.
		
		                    anderton
		          agatha.  can you see that?
		
		anderton looks at agatha, she's looking away.
		
		                    anderton
		          that's the man in the window.
		
		he looks at his watch.  counting down: eighteen minutes.
