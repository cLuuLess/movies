		int.  anderton's office - day
		
		as witwer stops working, stares at the screen.
		
		                    witwer
		          who does that look like to you?
		
		fletcher can't make it out, shakes his head.
		
		                    witwer
		          it's agatha.
		
		and now we see the image -- the ghost-like face of the female
		precog in the mirror.
		
		                    fletcher
		          so this means --
		
		witwer stands up straight as he realizes what it means.
		
		                    witwer
		          he's coming here to get her.
		
		witwer hits his comline...
		
		                    witwer
		          jad, ask the building who's come
		          and gone in the last couple of
		          hours...
