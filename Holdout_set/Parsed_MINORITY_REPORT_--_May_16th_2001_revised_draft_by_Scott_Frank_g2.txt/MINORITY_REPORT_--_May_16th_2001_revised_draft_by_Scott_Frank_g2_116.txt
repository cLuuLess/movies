		int.  tenement room - night
		
		as anderton follows the rope to the refrigerator and opens
		it.
		
		inside, among plates of rotting food we see one good
		sandwich.  anderton reaches in, runs his hand over the
		molding month-old goodies, passing the good sandwich and,
		instead, grabbing hold of a slimy, green piece of meat.
		
		much to our disgust, he shoves that in his mouth, immediately
		spits it out, then washes his mouth out with the old, ruined
		milk that sits next to the new stuff.  he spits that out now,
		too...
		
		                    anderton
		          shit!
		
		he reaches gingerly into the refrigerator, locates the good
		sandwich, sniffs it carefully, then wolfs it down.  he grabs
		a pitcher of water and drinks that down as well.
		
		anderton sits down in a chair.  the muffled voices next door
		get louder.
		
		he's sweating.  he keeps reaching for his dressings to
		scratch, then forces himself not to by clinging tightly to
		the armrests on the chair as the people next door move on to
		breaking things...
