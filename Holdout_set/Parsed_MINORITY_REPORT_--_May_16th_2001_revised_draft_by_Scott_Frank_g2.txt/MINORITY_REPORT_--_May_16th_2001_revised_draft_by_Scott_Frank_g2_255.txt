		int.  precog temple - night
		
		as the image plays out in agatha's eye... anne lively backing
		away...
		
		                    anderton (v.o.)
		          you fooled the other two precogs,
		          but not agatha.
		
		and now inside her eye, we see the image of burgess pulling
		on the same mask that john doe wore...
		
		                    anderton (v.o.)
		          she was going to see the murder of
		          her own mother no matter what state
		          you did it in, or how you tired to
		          hide it.
