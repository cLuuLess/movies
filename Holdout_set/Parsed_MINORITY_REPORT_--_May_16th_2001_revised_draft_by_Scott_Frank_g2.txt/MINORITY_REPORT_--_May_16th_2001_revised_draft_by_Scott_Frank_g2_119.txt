		ext.  tenement - night
		
		as knott and fletcher each unhook a round ball -- black, the
		size of billiard balls -- from their belts.
		
		fletcher rolls his towards the building.  knott does the
		same.  then they take six more and roll these as well.
		
		the balls
		
		roll a few feet, then begin to open up like daisies --
		daisies with legs.  robotic spyders, each the size of a fist,
		with an eyedentiscan antenna on their head, begin to click
		their way into the building.
		
		one of the spyders
		
		pauses in front of a closed door.  it flattens itself, then
		creeps under the door.
