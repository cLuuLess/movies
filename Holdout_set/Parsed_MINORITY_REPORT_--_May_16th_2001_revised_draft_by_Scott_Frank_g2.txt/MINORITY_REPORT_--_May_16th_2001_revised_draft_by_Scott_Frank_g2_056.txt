		as anderton slows down, turns up a dark alley.  he pauses,
		looks around.
		
		                    anderton
		          lycon?
		
		                    a voice
		          what's the matter, can't sleep?
		
		anderton turns and we see a dark figure in a black coat
		sitting in a doorway.  lycon.
		
		                    anderton
		          i just need a little clarity.
		
		                    lycon
		          true that.  you want the customary,
		          or the new and improved?
		
		                    anderton
		          i'll try the new stuff.
		
		anderton reaches into his sock and takes out some cash. 
		lycon takes out his own, much filthier sock and reaches
		inside.  he pulls out a handful of tiny black inhalers and
		holds a few of them out to anderton who hesitates, then takes
		them.
		
		                    lycon
		          sweet dreams, chief.
		
		"chief".  anderton turns and looks at the dealer.
		
		                    lycon
		          oh, don't worry none, your secret's
		          safe with me. 
		          after all, you gonna be the big
		          boss soon enough, be nice to have a
		          little juice on my side.
		
		                    anderton
		          what makes you say i'm gonna be the
		          boss?
		
		                    lycon
		          you're the perfect man for the job. 
		          it's like my daddy used to say, "in
		          the land of the blind..."
		
		lycon leans forward and the moonlight catches his face, and
		we see that both of his eyes are gone from their sockets.
		
		                    lycon
		          "the one eyed-man is king".
		
		lycon starts to laugh.  anderton watches him a moment, then
		turns and jogs off into the wet night.
