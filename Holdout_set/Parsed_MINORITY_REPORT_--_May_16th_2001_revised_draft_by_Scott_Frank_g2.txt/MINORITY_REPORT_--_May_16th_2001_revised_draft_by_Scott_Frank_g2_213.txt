		int.  lexus - day
		
		agatha stares out the window at the bay.  she looks pale,
		weak.  anderton's jacket is folded over her.
		
		                    agatha
		          can you see?  so beautiful...
		
		she looks at him.
		
		                    agatha
		          where are we going?
		
		                    anderton
		          someplace safe.
		
		                    agatha
		          i have to go back.
		
		                    anderton
		          why?
		
		                    agatha
		          the other two will die without me.
		
		                    anderton
		          you want to spend the rest of your
		          life in the temple?
		
		she looks back out the window.
		
		                    agatha
		          i always wondered what the world
		          would be like.  but now that i've
		          seen it, i don't need to see any
		          more.
		              (then)
		          it's all right.  once i'm in the
		          tank, i won't remember any of this.
		
		                    anderton
		          agatha, you're never going back
		          there.
		
		                    agatha
		          i am going back.  i see myself
		          there.
		
		he reacts to this.  she touches his arm.
		
		                    agatha
		          it's best, anderton, if you don't
		          think of me as human.
		
		he looks at her, but she closes her eyes.
