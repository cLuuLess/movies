		int.  hotel ballroom - night
		
		as the screen starts to show the same vision and people
		react.  burgess, at the back of the room sees it, too.
		
		                    anderton (phone)
		          so now you had to get rid of anne
		          lively, you had to find a way to
		          shut her up... which presented a
		          problem.  how can you murder her
		          without the precogs seeing it? 
		          simple: you use the system against
		          her.
		
		burgess quickly goes through a swinging door into...
		
		a corridor
		
		where he looks up and down the corridor for anderton.
		
		                    anderton (phone)
		          you hired someone to kill her for
		          you, knowing full well the precogs
		          would see that murder.
		
		burgess turns back, looks through a circle of glass in the
		swinging door at...
		
		the ballroom screen - a series of grainy images
		
		a figure in a black overcoat pulls on a mask...
		
		                    anderton (phone)
		          you lured anne lively out to the
		          lake with the promise of doing the
		          right thing, reuniting her with her
		          daughter...
		
		and now we see anne lively standing by the side of a lake,
		her hair whipping in the wind.  as the figure approaches...
		
		                    anne
		          mr. burgess?
