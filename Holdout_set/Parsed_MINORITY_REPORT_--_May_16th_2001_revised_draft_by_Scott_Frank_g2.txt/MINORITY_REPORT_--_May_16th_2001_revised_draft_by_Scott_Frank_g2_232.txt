		int.  department of containment - day
		
		as the tier begins to sink down into the floor, anderton
		starts to sink into the blackness below...
		
		                    anderton
		          gideon --
		              (screams)
		          gideon!
		
		but anderton's scream is drowned out by a blast from gideon's
		pipe organ as we now...
		
		cut to black.
		
		                    sean (v.o.)
		          dad?  wake up...
		
		and now we see anderton's son standing before him.  he's now
		eleven years-old.
		
		                    anderton
		          sean -- you're not real.
		
		                    sean
		          you gotta have faith, dad.
		
		                    anderton
		          it's a little late for that.
		
		                    sean
		          wanna hear something funny?
		
		                    anderton
		          what the hell.
		
		                    sean
		          i lived for a year with a man who
		          was pretending to be my father.  he
		          took me all over the world.
		
		anderton looks at him.
		
		                    anderton
		          you're alive?
		
		                    sean
		          no.
		              (then)
		          he got tired of pretending.
		
		                    anderton
		          oh, sean --
		
		                    sean
		          the funny thing is, i started to
		          believe he really was my dad.
		
		                    anderton
		          sean --
		
		                    sean
		          i feel bad about that.
		              (then)
		          i need you to forgive me.
		
		                    anderton
		          i forgive you.
		
		                    sean
		          once i even told him i loved him.
		
		                    anderton
		          i forgive you...
		
		                    sean
		          the more you want to believe
		          something, the easier it is to be
		          fooled.
		
		                    anderton
		          i was looking for you...
		
		                    sean
		          i know that.  i know you would have
		          done anything to find me.  i know
		          you would have died for me.
		
		                    anderton
		          i wanted to.
		
		                    sean
		          good-bye, dad...
		
		the boy begins to fade away.
		
		                    anderton
		          who are you?
		
		                    sean
		          i'm your son.  i'm you.
		
		                    anderton
		          sean, wait...
		
		                    sean
		              (now six years old)
		          hold your breath, dad...
		
		and he's gone.  anderton is left alone in the dark.
