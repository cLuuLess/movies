		int.  precrime analytical room - morning
		
		as anderton looks at the prevision, begins manipulating the
		images... he glances at the precog monitor.  the female face
		writhes in the screen and anderton looks at her.
		
		                    anderton
		          where we going, agatha?  talk to
		          me.
		
		anderton turns away as fletcher (30), second in command
		approaches anderton.  the female face turns and seems to look
		at anderton through the screen.
		
		                    fletcher
		          chief, the investigator from the
		          fed is here.
		
		                    anderton
		              (distracted)
		          you're kidding, that's today?
		
		                    fletcher
		          i wrote it down in your calendar,
		          then left a message at your house --
		
		                    anderton
		              (working)
		          all i need, some twink from the fed
		          poking around right now.
		              (then, to jad)
		          check again with the paper, they
		          had it forwarded.  see if the
		          neighbors know where they went,
		          check all relations --
		
		                    fletcher
		          uh, sir...
		
		                    anderton
		          get him some coffee and tell him to
		          wait outside.
		
		                    voice
		          i've got coffee, thank you.
		
		anderton turns to see danny witwer.  mid-twenties, quietly
		looking at everything and everyone.  he extends his hand.
		
		                    witwer
		          danny witwer.
		              (then)
		          the "twink from the fed".  gum?
		
		anderton gives him a look, witwer offers anderton a stick of
		gum.
		
		                    jad
		          the marks moved two weeks ago.  no
		          one knows where.  still searching
		          for family and employer.
		
		                    mechanical voice
		          time horizon: 12 minutes...
		
		anderton looks at his watch: counting down, 12 minutes.
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm sorry danny, but i'll have to
		          give you the full tour later on.
		
		                    witwer
		          your secretaries were all kind
		          enough to give me a look around the
		          office...
		
		anderton looks through the glass doors where a half dozen
		female precrime office workers ogle witwer, even one that's
		pregnant (a moving image of her baby on the front of her
		maternity t-shirt).  they all chew gum.
		
		witwer watches as anderton moves his fingers across the
		display, "flying through" the precrime scene, moving forward
		and back in time.  architectural reference screens run side
		by-side with the prevision screen...
		
		                    anderton
		          original running bond brick
		          pattern, streamlined early georgian
		          details...
		
		fletcher begins pointing out the equipment to witwer who just
		listens quietly... asks no questions.
		
		                    fletcher
		          what he's doing now, we call
		          "scrubbing the image", looking for
		          clues as to where the murder's
		          going to happen.
		
		                    anderton
		          the brick has been repointed, the
		          glass is original with new glazing
		          bars.  i show composite mouldings
		          with dentils.
		              (then)
		          someone took care in the
		          renovation.  let's find the
		          architect...
		
		                    fletcher
		          victims are pronounced here. 
		          killers here.  we never touch
		          anything.
		
		                    anderton
		          i show a cop on horseback.
		
		                    jad
		          somewhere near the capital?
		
		                    anderton
		          no maglev system.
		
		                    jad
		          the mall?
		
		                    anderton
		          georgetown.
		
		fletcher introduces witwer to a female member of the team.
		
		                    fletcher
		          this is evanna, the team pilot.
		
		                    witwer
		          nice to meet you.  gum?
		
		she gives him a once over, takes a piece of gum.
		
		                    evanna
		          oh, thank you...
		
		he pops a piece in his own mouth, cuts a look back at her...
		
		                    witwer
		          she's cute.
		
		witwer now notices the three faces on screen, can't take his
		eyes off them.  witwer looks at the images on the screen. 
		these three faces writhing in agony.
		
		                    fletcher
		          filtered, the precogs can see
		          outward up to four days with a
		          sensory range of 200 miles.
		
		witwer stares at them, blowing a bubble.
		
		                    witwer
		          so if you wanna kill someone, you
		          take him to miami.
		
		                    fletcher
		          not after the vote next week.  once
		          the amendment passes, we go
		          national, there's gonna be nowhere
		          to run.
		
		anderton cuts a look at him as jad indicates a 3d map full of
		blue dots...
		
		                    jad
		          two howard markses eyedented in the
		          sprawl.  neither show married --
		
		anderton looks at the reference screens as they scroll
		through architectural imagery...
		
		                    anderton
		          i show a match for dwight kingsley. 
		          nineteenth century architect.  he
		          did two dozen houses in d.c....
		
		                    mechanical voice
		          time horizon, ten minutes...
		
		witwer reacts to the incessant ringing of the alarm bell.
		
		                    witwer
		          can't they shut that off?
		
		                    fletcher
		          that's the red ball alarm.
		
		witwer looks at him.
		
		                    fletcher
		          crime of passion.  no
		          premeditation.  they show up late. 
		          most of our scrambles are flash
		          events like this one.  we rarely
		          see anything with premeditation
		          anymore.
		
		                    witwer
		          people have gotten the message.
		              (to fletcher)
		          gum?
