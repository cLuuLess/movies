		ext.  brownstone - morning
		
		howard marks pauses, notices a man -- handsome, muscular,
		practically bursting out of a nice suit -- loitering in front
		of the small park across the street.  howard studies the man
		a moment as sarah appears in the doorway behind him, sees him
		looking at the man.
		
		                    sarah
		          breakfast, honey.
		
		and now the man across the street looks this way, sees
		howard, sees sarah right behind him and quickly moves off.
		
		                    howard
		          he looks familiar.
		
		                    sarah
		          who?
		
		                    howard
		          the man across the street.  i've
		          seen him before...
		
		                    sarah
		          how can you even tell?  you know
		          how blind you are without your
		          glasses.
