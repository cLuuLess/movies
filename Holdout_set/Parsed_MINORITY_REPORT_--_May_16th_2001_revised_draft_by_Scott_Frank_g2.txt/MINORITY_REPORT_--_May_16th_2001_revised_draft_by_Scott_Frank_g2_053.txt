		as anderton runs through the city, we now hear other voices
		joining in saying the same thing, over and over, finally
		overlapping one another:
		
		                    voices
		          precrime: it works!
		              (until we hear)

		          going to the playground...
		
		                    policeman
		          my partner was murdered...
		
		                    various people
		          my sister was murdered... my
		          brother was killed... i was
		          attacked in the stairwell... my
		          teacher was stabbed... my neighbor
		          was shot... my child was
		          murdered...
		
		and now we see a series of shocking murder scenes, as the
		above testimonials continue in the b.g.
