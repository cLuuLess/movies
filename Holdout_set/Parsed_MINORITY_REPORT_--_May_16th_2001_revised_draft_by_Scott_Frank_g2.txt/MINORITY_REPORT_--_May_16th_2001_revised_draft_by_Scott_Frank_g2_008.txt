		ext.  brownstone in georgetown - morning
		
		as the sprinklers come on just as howard marks, the older man
		we saw stab his wife, steps out of the house.
		
		                    voice
		          morning, mr. marks.
		
		he looks over as a paperboy waves from a recumbent bicycle
		and tosses a newspaper.  as it flies at us...
