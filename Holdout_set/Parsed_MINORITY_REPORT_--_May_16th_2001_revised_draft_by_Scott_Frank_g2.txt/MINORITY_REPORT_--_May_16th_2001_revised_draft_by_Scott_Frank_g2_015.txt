		as jad looks at an array of driver's license photos... we see
		one for howard marks.  then another for sarah marks.  same
		address.
		
		                    jad
		          got him in the foxhall.  4421
		          gainsborough.
		
		                    anderton
		          send a dcpd blue & white out there,
		          set up a perimeter and tell 'em
		          we're en route.  what's our
		          confirmed time?
		
		                    jad
		          from solar position, trig & image
		          confirms it at approximately eight
		          oh-four a.m.
