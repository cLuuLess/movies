		int.  willard ballroom - night
		
		a video presentation of the history of precrime, and lamar
		burgess.  we hear music, see different shots of burgess at
		his rehab-prison, we hear about its fabulous success rate. 
		the video ends to great applause.
		
		                    announcer
		          ladies and gentlemen, lamar
		          burgess, director of the new,
		          national precrime.
		
		applause.  then the room falls silent as burgess' staff
		presents him with an ivory box.  he opens it, looks at his
		secretary who smiles.
		
		                    secretary
		          congratulations, sir.
		
		                    burgess
		          my god...
		
		he holds up a beautiful ivory-handled antique revolver and
		the crowd ooohs and ahhhs.
		
		                    burgess
		          how did you get this?
		
		                    secretary
		          i padded your expense account for
		          the last six months.
		
		laughter.  but as he stares at the gun, moved almost to
		tears, the room grows silent.  he looks up.
		
		                    burgess
		          revolvers like this one were given
		          to generals at the end of the civil
		          war by their troops.  the cylinders
		          were loaded with six gold-plated
		          bullets to symbolize the end of the
		          destruction and death that had
		          ripped the country apart for six
		          years.
		
		he opens the gun and shows them the six gold bullets.  we
		pick out lara in an evening gown at the back of the room,
		watching, her eyes fixed on burgess.
		
		                    burgess
		          with precrime going national, maybe
		          we can all look forward to a time
		          when none of us have to discharge
		          another firearm ever again.
		
		everyone applauds.  burgess' secretary gets a phone call and
		ducks her head so that she can hear...
		
		                    burgess
		          i think people forget that, for all
		          the talk about the precogs,
		          precrime is only as good as the men
		          and women who support them...
