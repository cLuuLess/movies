		int.  department of containment - early morning
		
		silent.  a huge open space, a human warehouse.  along the
		floor -- ringing the entire perimeter -- are markers with
		numbers on the front of them.  we now hear footsteps as...
		
		anderton enters the building.  as he moves further into the
		space, our angle changes and we now see human bodies lying on
		their backs on the other side of the markers.  each
		"prisoner" has a metal halo-like apparatus -- spikes going
		inward -- fitted onto his head.
		
		anderton slows his pace, eyeing the row of inert bodies along
		the floor as he goes.  above each inert prisoner is a screen
		that continuously plays the precog's prevision of the murder
		for which they've been convicted.
		
		suddenly we hear a blast of organ music reverberating from
		somewhere o.s. and he looks off towards a curtain at the
		back...
		
		on the curtain
		
		as anderton parts it to reveal:
		
		a living space
		
		a bed.  a stove.  a fridge... and a huge pipe organ.  a man
		in a wheelchair playing with his back to us.  from the sound
		of it, he seems to be making it up as he goes along. 
		anderton taps the guy on the shoulder, startling him --
		
		                    man
		          hoo boy!
		              (then)
		          you scared me, chief.
		
		he takes a breath, looks at anderton standing there.  the
		man's face is large, almost retarded in appearance.  he wears
		a prison guard uniform.
		
		                    anderton
		          you the sentry?
		
		                    gideon
		          yes, sir.  i'm gideon.
		              (indicates the organ)
		          the music relaxes the prisoners.
		
		anderton looks around as gideon quickly moves away from the
		organ.
		
		                    gideon
		          i don't ever see any of you precops
		          down here, i'm not in trouble am i?
		
		                    anderton
		          no, you're not in trouble.  i'm
		          interested in a murder.
		
		                    gideon
		          kill type?
		
		                    anderton
		          drowning.
		
		gideon turns to a computer screen on his wheelchair.
		
		                    gideon
		          well, that narrows it down.  not
		          many in here for that one.
		
		gideon starts going through the files, we see different faces
		flash by.  anderton looks over his shoulder.
		
		                    anderton
		          victim's a white female.
		
		                    gideon
		          this about the justice department?
		              (off anderton's look)
		          they laid on a tour for tomorrow
		          a.m.  told me to wear a tie.  you
		          like this one?
		
		the face of the drowning woman agatha showed anderton flashes
		on the screen.
		
		                    anderton
		          stop!  roll back... there!
		
		gideon looks at the screen.
		
		                    gideon
		          that's an old one.  one of our
		          first.
		
		                    anderton
		          this is the official composite of
		          the three precogs?
		
		                    gideon
		          that's right.  it's a combined data
		          stream based on all three
		          previsions.
		
		                    anderton
		          show me just agatha's data stream.
		
		                    gideon
		          for that, we have to go for a ride.
		
		gideon rolls ahead of anderton, checking his manifest on a
		small display.  anderton looks around.
		
		                    anderton
		          you the only sentry?
		
		                    gideon
		          i work graveyard, swing and day all
		          by my lonesome.
		
		gideon hits a button on his wheelchair and we hear a rumbling
		sound as the "prisoners" around the perimeter all begin to
		rise.
		
		                    gideon
		          hey, bet you don't know where the
		          term "graveyard shift" comes from?
		
		only half-listening, anderton watches as now a second tier of
		markers appear right below the first tier.  the video screens
		playing the murder previsions over and over...
		
		                    gideon
		          long time ago, in merry old
		          england, they discovered that some
		          coffins, after they reopened 'em --
		          now why they did that, i couldn't
		          tell you --
		
		and now we see a third tier, also with the video screens
		showing their own horrific images.
		
		                    gideon
		          anyway, they discovered that some
		          of the coffins had scratch marks on
		          the inside, indicating that the
		          person had not been dead when they
		          buried them.
		
		and now anderton watches as a fourth tier rises up.
		
		                    gideon
		          so they tied a string to the wrist
		          of each person that lead to a bell
		          above ground.
		
		anderton has to tilt his neck to see the top of the tiers as
		a fifth tier rises up from the ground...
		
		                    gideon
		          someone was assigned to sit at
		          night and listen for the bells.
		
		... until the bodies and their markers are stacked nearly to
		the roof of the facility and gideon turns to anderton and
		smiles.
		
		                    gideon
		          hence the expression...
		
		                    anderton
		              (softly, staring at all
		               the prisoners)
		          ... graveyard shift.
		
		                    gideon
		          not to mention, "saved by the
		          bell".
		
		gideon starts to roll off.  anderton stands there, looking at
		all of them.
		
		                    anderton
		          i'd forgotten there were so many.
		
		gideon rolls onto a platform attached to a long arm and
		wheels around to face anderton.
		
		                    gideon
		          and to think they'd all be out
		          there killing people if it wasn't
		          for you.
		
		anderton moves onto the platform they lift up and away.
