		int.  tenement room - day
		
		a strange, near zoetrope-like lighting effect on the walls
		and ceiling as, outside, the maglev cars go whizzing by.  as
		dr. eddie looks down at us...
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          don't take the bandages off for
		          twelve hours.  if you take them off
		          before then, you'll go blind.  do
		          you understand?
		
		anderton lies on a caved-in bed, his face swathed in a white
		bandage.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          there's food in the refrigerator. 
		          make sure you drink a lot of water.
		
		                    anderton
		          how do i find the --
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          here --
		
		he takes anderton's hand and places it on a rope that's tied
		from the bedpost to the bathroom and the kitchen --
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          it goes from the bathroom to the
		          kitchen.
		
		                    anderton
		              (tries to sit up)
		          i can't even stand up --
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          i know you're in a hurry, so i
		          juiced up the nano-reconstruction
		          around your new eyes.
		
		                    anderton
		          the nano... what?
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          organic microbots that reconstruct
		          the nerves and blood vessels. 
		          it'll feel like fleas chewing on
		          your eyeballs.  but whatever you
		          do, don't scratch.
		
		anderton is already reaching his hands up to his bandages. 
		dr. eddie forces them away.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          seeing as we're old pals and all,
		          i'm giving you a bonus, might come
		          in handy.  feel this.
		
		dr. eddie takes an air-syringe from his pocket and touches it
		to anderton's hand.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          it's a temporary paralytic enzyme. 
		          shoot this baby under your chin. 
		          right here...
		
		dr. eddie presses the tip into the soft underpart of
		anderton's chin.  anderton recoils.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          the enzyme turns your facial
		          muscles to mush.  you won't look
		          like the same man.  you tighten up
		          again in about thirty minutes. 
		          hurts like nothing you ever felt.
		              (drops it in a bag)
		          i'll just drop it in your goodie
		          bag along with the uh...
		
		he holds up the bag with anderton's old eyes.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          ... leftovers.
		
		next dr. eddie takes a small clock from his pocket and places
		it on a dresser beside anderton's bed.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          i'm setting up a timer.  when it
		          goes off tomorrow, take off your
		          bandages and get the hell out of
		          here.  but not before then, or
		          you'll --
		
		                    anderton
		          -- go blind.  i know.
		
		he takes something from his pocket, puts it into anderton's
		hand.  a black inhaler.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          a little something from our mutual
		          friend.
		
		                    voice
		          that you, chief?
		
		anderton turns towards the voice and we see lycon standing in
		the doorway, clutching his dirty sock full of inhalers, his
		mangy seeing eye dog at his heel.
		
		                    dr. eddie
		          i believe you know lycon.  i
		          purchase my more hard to get
		          pharmaceuticals from him.  and, of
		          course, once upon a time he was
		          also a patient of mine.  like you.
		
		                    lycon
		          good luck, chief.
		
		and they start out of there, lycon's dog bumping into the
		wall on the way out.  we hear the door close o.s.  anderton
		lies there, gripping the bed, listening to the tick tick tick
		of the timer.  we now...
		
		                                             dissolve to:
