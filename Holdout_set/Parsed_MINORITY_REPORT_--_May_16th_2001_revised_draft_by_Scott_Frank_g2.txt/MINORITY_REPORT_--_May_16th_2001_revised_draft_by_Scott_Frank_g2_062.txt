		int.  precrime analytical room - day
		
		as jad, fletcher and knott show witwer one of the wooden
		"eggs".  all of them now chewing gum, friendly with witwer.
		
		                    fletcher
		          the information we need is embedded
		          in the grain of wood.  and since
		          each piece is unique, the shape and
		          grain is impossible to duplicate.
		
		                    witwer
		              (returns the sphere to
		               fletcher)
		          i'm sure you've all grasped the
		          legalistic drawback to precrime
		          methodology.
		
		                    knott
		          here we go again...
		
		                    witwer
		          look, i'm not with the aclu on this
		          jeff.  but let's not kid ourselves,
		          we are arresting individuals who've
		          broken no law.
		
		                    jad
		          but they will.
		
		                    fletcher
		          the commission of the crime itself
		          is absolute metaphysics.  the
		          precogs see the future.  and
		          they're never wrong.
		
		                    witwer
		          but it's not the future if you stop
		          it.  isn't that a fundamental
		          paradox?
		
		                    anderton (o.s.)
		          yes, it is.
		
		they all turn and look at anderton as he comes into the room,
		takes the sphere from fletcher.
		
		                    anderton
		          you're talking about
		          predetermination, which happens all
		          the time.
		
		suddenly, anderton rolls the ball towards witwer who catches
		it just as it's about to go off the table.
		
		                    anderton
		          why did you catch that?
		
		                    witwer
		          because it was going to fall.
		
		                    anderton
		          you're certain?
		
		                    witwer
		          yes.
		
		                    anderton
		          but it didn't fall.  you caught it.
		
		witwer looks at the ball in his hand.
		
		                    anderton
		          the fact that you prevented it from
		          happening doesn't change the fact
		          that it was going to happen.
		
		                    witwer
		          you ever get any false positives? 
		          someone intends to kill his boss or
		          his wife, but they never go through
		          with it.  how do the precogs tell
		          the difference?
		
		                    anderton
		          the precogs don't see what you
		          intend to do, only what you will
		          do.
		
		                    witwer
		          then why can't they see rapes, or
		          assaults... or suicides?
		
		                    fletcher
		          because of the nature of murder.
		              (quoting)
		          "there's nothing more destructive
		          to the metaphysical fabric that
		          binds us than the untimely murder
		          of one human being by another".
		
		                    witwer
		          somehow, i don't think that was
		          walt whitman.
		
		anderton looks at witwer.  the man knows more than he
		thought.
		
		                    anderton
		              (looking at witwer)
		          it was iris hineman.  she developed
		          the precogs, designed the system
		          and pioneered the interface.
		
		                    witwer
		          speaking of interfacing, i'd love
		          to say hello.
		
		                    anderton
		          to hineman?
		
		witwer looks at the screens showing the precogs.
		
		                    witwer
		          to them.
		
		                    anderton
		          cops aren't allowed inside the
		          temple.
		
		                    witwer
		          really?  you've never been inside?
		
		                    anderton
		          we keep a strict separation so that
		          no one can accuse us of tampering.
		
		                    witwer
		          so i'll be the first one to go in
		          then?
		
		                    anderton
		          maybe you didn't hear me.
		
		                    witwer
		          if it's a question of authority.
		
		                    anderton
		          there's no question.  you don't
		          have any.
		
		                    witwer
		          i have a warrant in my pocket that
		          says different.
		
		the other men don't move, don't blink.
		
		                    anderton
		          show it to me.
		
		witwer pulls out a piece of paper from his pocket folded
		several times and hands it to him.  as anderton unfolds it...
		
		                    witwer
		          contrary to what you might think,
		          this experiment is being conducted
		          under the supervision and with the
		          express permission of the attorney
		          general of the united states.  i'm
		          here as his representative.  which
		          means... you're now operating under
		          my supervision.
		
		anderton looks up from the paper, at his men, at witwer. 
		he's lost and he knows it.  witwer takes the paper back.
		
		                    witwer
		          it seems you've been left out of
		          the loop, john.
		
		inside the temple
		
		as wally, the caretaker, an odd little guy who doesn't get a
		lot of sun looks over as witwer and anderton walk through a
		laser decontamination booth...
		
		                    wally
		          no no no no no...
		
		witwer smiles, extends his hand.  wally backs away.
		
		                    wally
		          i can't touch you!  and john, you
		          can't be in here!  you'll confuse
		          them!
		
		                    anderton
		          wally.  this is danny witwer.  he's
		          from justice and we're to give him
		          a full run of the farm.
		
		                    witwer
		          nice to meet you, wally.
		
		                    wally
		          shhh!  they're sleeping.
		
		                    witwer
		              (whispers)
		          tell me how all this works.
		
		and now we see: the tank
		
		as a ripple appears in the white liquid.
		
		                    witwer (o.s.)
		          the photon milk acts as both a
		          nutrient supply and a liquid
		          conductor.  it makes the images
		          that each of them receive strong.
		
		and now a man's face slowly breaks the surface, then another
		man's face, followed by a female face...
		
		pull back to reveal: the three precogs
		
		three nude bodies -- two male, one female.  as they writhe
		about in the liquid, we can see that their bodies are thin,
		nearly translucent.
		
		the precogs appear to be in suspended animation or in comas. 
		they are absolutely still and limp, except for their faces
		which are in constant motion, reacting to murders only they
		can see.
		
		                    wally
		          we call the female agatha.  the
		          twins are arthur and dashiell.
		
		reveal: the precog tank
		
		egg-like in shape, it's filled with the milky-looking liquid
		the three precogs are suspended in.
		
		                    wally
		          we scan by way of optical
		          tomography, white light pinpoints
		          pulse along the entire length of
		          the headgear and are re-read after
		          absorption through their brain
		          tissue.
		
		witwer looks at him, has no idea what he just said.
		
		                    wally
		          in other words, we see what they
		          see.
		
		wally lifts one of the male precogs into a harness and hoists
		him up for exercise and cleaning.  wally starts to trim his
		nails and the precog begins convulsing...
		
		                    wally
		          they're not in any pain.  we keep
		          their heads pretty well stocked
		          with dopamine and endorphins. 
		          plus, we maintain careful control
		          over their serotonin levels --
		          don't want 'em to drift off to
		          sleep, but they can't be kept too
		          awake either.
		
		                    anderton
		          it helps if you don't think of them
		          as human.
		
		                    witwer
		              (staring at them)
		          no... they're much more than that.
		
		witwer nods, looks up at the screens above the tank, a series
		of screens tapped into each precog.  we can see all sorts of
		images, but none of them clear right now.  he's mesmerized by
		all of them.
		
		                    witwer
		          science has stolen most of our
		          miracles.  in a way...
		              (indicates the tank)
		          ... they give us hope... hope of
		          the existence of the divine.
		
		he sees anderton and wally looking at him.
		
		                    witwer
		          i find it interesting that some
		          people have begun to deify the
		          precogs.
		
		                    anderton
		          the precogs are pattern recognition
		          filters, nothing more.
		
		                    witwer
		          but you call this room the
		          "temple".
		
		                    anderton
		          just a nickname.
		
		                    witwer
		              (nods, then)
		          the oracle isn't where the power is
		          anyway.  the power's always been
		          with the priests.
		              (looks at the precogs)
		          even if they had to invent the
		          oracle.
		
		anderton looks to where fletcher, jad and knott stand near
		the entrance, nodding their heads.
		
		                    anderton
		          you guys are nodding your heads
		          like you actually know what the
		          hell he's talking about.
		
		                    jad
		          come on, chief, you think about it,
		          the way we work -- changing destiny
		          and all -- we're more like clergy
		          than cops.
		
		                    anderton
		          uh-huh.  jad?
		
		                    jad
		          sir?
		
		                    anderton
		          go back to work.  all of you.
		
		the others give him a look and walk out.  anderton turns back
		to witwer who smiles at him.
		
		                    witwer
		          sorry.  old habit.  i spent three
		          years at fuller seminary before i
		          became a cop.  my father was a
		          minister.  lutheran.
		
		                    anderton
		          what does he think of your chosen
		          line of work?
		
		                    witwer
		          i don't know.  he was shot and
		          killed when i was fourteen on the
		          steps of his church in bethesda.
		
		he looks at anderton.
		
		                    witwer
		          i know what it's like to lose
		          someone close, john.  of course,
		          nothing is like the loss of a
		          child.
		
		agatha rolls over now, seems to be looking at anderton.
		
		                    witwer
		          i don't have any children of my
		          own, so i can only imagine what
		          that must have been like, to lose
		          your son in a public place like
		          that.
		
		anderton says nothing.  hates the man all over again.
		
		                    witwer
		          at least now you -- and i -- have
		          the chance to make sure that kind
		          of thing doesn't happen to anyone
		          ever again.
		
		                    anderton
		              (beat)
		          why don't you cut the cute act,
		          danny, and tell me exactly what it
		          is you're looking for?
		
		                    witwer
		          flaws.
		
		                    anderton
		          there hasn't been a murder in six
		          years.  there's nothing wrong with
		          the system.  it's perfect.
		
		                    witwer
		          i agree.  the system is perfect. 
		          if there's a flaw, it's human.  it
		          always is.
		              (then)
		          thank you for the tour, wally.
		
		anderton watches him walk out, shakes his head, then
		notices...
		
		the female precog's arm is resting on the edge of the tank. 
		he looks down at her a moment.  she's looking at him, but her
		eyes seem somewhere else.
		
		anderton looks around for wally, doesn't see him.  he doesn't
		want to touch her.  he finally reaches down and gently takes
		her arm, sets it back into the tank.
		
		as it submerges, she takes hold of anderton's finger and
		hangs on.  he stares back at her.  she holds on tight...
		
		                    anderton
		          uh, wally --
		
		he tries to pull his hand away, but she holds on, grabs onto
		anderton's shirt, and starts trying to pull herself out of
		the water...
		
		                    anderton
		          wally!
		
		                    agatha
		              (whisper)
		          can you see?
		
		and now she's clinging to anderton, looking up.  he looks up
		at the screen above her and sees...
		
		a flash of a woman's face.  silent.  eyes and mouth wide
		open.  a shock of red hair all around her.  her face is a
		white mask of terror.  she seems to be beckoning anderton
		with her arm...
		
		he looks at agatha, who continues to cling to him, her own
		face holds the same expression as the woman on the screen. 
		she finally lets go of anderton and falls back into the tank.
		
		                    wally
		          john?!
		
		anderton, shaken, looks up and the image fades, replaced with
		the blurry flood of images we saw earlier.
		
		                    wally
		          what the hell just happened?  her
		          acth levels just shot through the
		          roof!
		
		anderton turns and looks at the precog writhing about.
		
		                    wally
		          her pituitary dumped a week's worth
		          into her system... what did you do
		          to her?
		
		                    anderton
		          nothing... she grabbed me, and then
		          there was an image on the screen...
		
		                    wally
		          she grabbed you?  impossible.  the
		          precogs aren't even aware of us. 
		          in the milk all they see is the
		          future.
		
		anderton shoots a look down the hall as witwer walks through
		the laser decontaminator, unaware of what just happened.  he
		turns to wally and lowers his voice...
		
		                    anderton
		          she was looking right at me.
		
		                    wally
		          it could have been a nightmare...
		          sometimes they dream about the old
		          murders.
		
		anderton looks back down at agatha, her eyes closed now as
		she sinks down into the milk and disappears, her own arm in
		front of her, beckoning in the same way as the woman.
		
		                    anderton
		          she spoke to me.
		
		                    wally
		              (dismissive)
		          to you?  i don't think so...
		              (but has to know)
		          what'd she say?
		
		                    anderton
		          she said...
		
		anderton looks up at the screens...
		
		                    anderton
		          "can you see?"
