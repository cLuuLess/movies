		int.  hotel room - day
		
		agatha sits beside anderton on the bed.
		
		                    anderton
		          every day for the last six years
		          i've thought about only two things. 
		          the first was what my son would
		          look like if he were alive today. 
		          if i would even recognize him if i
		          saw him on the street.
		              (then)
		          the second was what i would do to
		          the man who took him.
		
		                    agatha
		          anderton --
		
		                    anderton
		          you were right.  i'm not being set
		          up.
		
		anderton looks at the photograph.
		
		                    anderton
		          i'm gonna kill this man.
