		                    wally
		          chief?
		
		anderton's too stunned to answer.
		
		                    wally
		          i like you, chief.
		
		anderton looks at wally's face on the screen now.
		
		                    wally
		          you've always been nice to me.
		              (then)
		          i'll give you two minutes before i
		          hit the siren.
		
		anderton looks at the caretaker a second, then slowly gets up
		and walks out the door...
