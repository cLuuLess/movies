		where anderton lies still as a halo clicks into his shaved
		head.  anderton moves his eyes and sees gideon smiling over
		him.
		
		                    gideon
		          you're part of my flock now, john. 
		          welcome.

		          it's actually kind of a rush.  they
		          say you get visions; that your life
		          flashes before your eyes.  that all
		          your dreams come true.
		
		anderton struggles, but can't move.  gideon starts to roll
		away.
