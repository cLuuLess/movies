ext. world's fair - night

jay knows what he has to do. he picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete
dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the bug.

				jay
		hey! come over here and try that!

the concrete thunks off the bug's shell -- he doesn't seem to notice; just
keeps moving.

jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the bug.

				jay
		stop right there, or i'll start wailing on
		your waxy, pointed ass!

jay starts pounding on the bug with the metal pole.
