int. chinese restaurant - night

-- the flash dims on edwards and kay, sitting at a table in a chinese
restaurant.

				kay
			(finishing a joke)
		-- and the wife says yeah, harry, i know,
		but this one's eating my popcorn!

he busts out laughing. edwards, across from him, is completely
disoriented. he looks down. there's a half-eaten order of broccoli beef
and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him.

				edwards
		huh?

kay checks his watch.

				kay
		whoops. gotta run. thanks for the egg rolls.

				edwards
		where am i?

				kay
		see what i mean about tequila? you're a
		bright young man, james. just lay off the
		sauce. i'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.
		sharp.

he turns and walks out. edwards checks his watch. a waitress appears.

				waitress
		another beer?

				edwards
		coffee. please.

she walks off. edwards looks at the table. there is a business card lying
next to his plate, on which kay has handwritten "james d. edwards,
saturday, 9 a.m., 504 battery drive."

edwards looks at it, puzzled. he turns the card over and looks at the
other side. there's not much there, no name, no phone or fax number, no
e-mail address. just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card:

				mib
