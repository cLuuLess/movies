edgar rushes outside as the tow truck driver gets the van up on the hoist.

				edgar
		that's my truck!

				driver
		and make sure you tell them that at the
		impound.

edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve
gauge. he points it at the tow truck driver. the tow truck driver looks at
him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun.

				driver (cont'd)
		i got worse.

he keeps hitching up the van. two pedestrians walk past the dispute, very
fast, ignoring the debate, headed right for the shop. we go with them, and
realize that it's --

-- jay and kay. they stop at the smashed door of the jewelry shop and
exchange a glance. kay pulls a very menacing-looking weapon, nods, and
they step inside.
