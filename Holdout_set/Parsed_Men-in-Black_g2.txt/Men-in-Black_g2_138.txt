ext. newsstand - day

close on various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them. here's
one:
			 mets' centerfielder says:
		     "ufo made me miss home run ball!"
and here's another one:
		    detroit has car that defies gravity!
			secret tests in n.y.'s tunnel
and a third:
			man awakens from 30-year coma
		        returns to girl he left behind

a large photograph shows a smiling kay, arm-in-arm with elizabeth reston,
his long-lost fiancee, in her back yard in tempe, arizona.

she holds a large bouquet of flowers, the same kind he brought but never
gave her thirty years ago.

jay, who's reading the paper, smiles.

at the curb, jay hurries back to the ltd with the newspapers. elle,
(formerly laurel), is waiting, leaning against the hood. tailored black
suit. black shoes. short-cropped hair. the look never looked better.

				elle
		zed called. the high consulate of regent-9
		emissary wants floor seats to the knicks --
		bulls game.

				jay
		i'll talk to dennis rodman, it's his damn
		planet.

				elle
		let's roll.

both car doors slam, jay drops it in gear, and the ltd blasts away from
the curb.
