kay raises another lit match to his cigarette, but as this one gets close,
a big glob of goo drops from the ceiling and onto the match, dousing the
flame.

ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. he's dead, a frozen
look of terror on his face and the can of raid still clutched in his hand.

from inside the morgue, laurel screams.
