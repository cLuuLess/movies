ext. shea stadium - night

at shea stadium, a mets game is in progress. behind the home plate side,
the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible.

but at that very moment, the batter cracks into a fastball, hard. the
crowd rises to its feet, shouting, staring out at center field, where the
ball is headed.

all eyes in the house are on the mets' center fielder, except for his
eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. his eyes widen,
his jaw drops --

-- and the catchable ball sails over his head, thudding into the wall
behind him. the crowd boos viciously.
