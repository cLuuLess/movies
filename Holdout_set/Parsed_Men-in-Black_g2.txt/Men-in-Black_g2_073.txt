int. gem and jewelry store - day

they look around and see the recent demolition caused by edgar. jay
furrows his brow.

				jay
		who robs a jewelry store and leaves the
		jewels?

				kay
		someone who's not looking for jewels.

jay moves behind the counter. on the floor is an ornate, empty bowl and a
bag of cat food, next to a scrumptious pillow. there are several photos of
a cat on the wall.

there is also a pile of bejeweled cat collars. jay picks up one of the
collars, inspects it closely, shaking his head.

				jay
		this guy had a serious crush on his cat.

jay's attention is broken by something through the window. outside,
lumbering straight for the store, is edgar.

jay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face?

suddenly, edgar raises his arms, pointing both the farmer's rifle and the
driver's shotgun. before edgar can shoot, jay yells...

				jay
		kay! get down!

and then jay fires, shattering the storefront window, and blowing up a car
on the street. the blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, slamming
him into the wall with tremendous force. edgar turns and rushes away down
the street as jay picks himself up.

				jay
		the bug in the edgar suit! the ugly redneck
		from the picture! that's him!

jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after edgar.

				kay
			(picking himself up)
		damn it.

kay runs out after jay.
