ext. desert clearing -- night

kay has an arm around janus, whom he is leading further into the clearing.
janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.

				agent janus
		th -- th -- th --

				kay
			(helping)
		"that."

				agent janus
		that wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --

				kay
		human, i know. oops. got some entrails on
		you.

he takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the agent's face. as he does,
janus looks back to where mikey blew up. then at kay. and then up at the
stars.

the other ins agents burst over the rise, shouting questions.

				kay
		okay, everybody, situation's under control,
		calm down. if you'll just give me your
		attention for a moment i'll tell you what
		happened.

from over the rise, car engines whine in the distance and headlights start
to flash around them. kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular
metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. he checks his watch,
figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the
device up to "08."

				kay (cont'd)
		this is called a "neuralyzer." a gift from
		some friends from out of town. the red eye
		here isolates and measures the electronic
		impulses in your brain. more specifically,
		the ones for memory.

behind him, six more men in black, all wearing black suits and sunglasses,
come over the hill. kay barks a few orders to them.

				kay (cont'd)
		gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;
		holes at 40, 60, and 80.

				2nd ins agent
		what in the hell is going on?!

				kay
		exactly the right question. and the answer
		lies right -- here. pay attention.

				janus
		who are you, really?

				kay
		really? i'm just a figment of your
		imagination.

he holds up the neuralyzer. the agents peer closely at it.  kay reaches
into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses --

-- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  a blinding flash a
tenth of a second long sears the agents' eyeballs. they stare blankly.

				kay (cont'd)
		god, we're a gullible breed.

behind him, tongues of fire blast from a flame thrower held by one of the
men in black. kay looks back at the ins agents, who are just coming
around, as if awakening from a concussion.

				kay (cont'd)
		i mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be
		alive after a blast like that.

the agents look around, confused.

				agent janus
		what -- blast?

kay gestures behind him, where the men in black are now using fire
extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.

				kay
		underground gas vein, genius. you guys need
		to exercise more caution before discharging
		your firearms.

he jabs a finger into janus' chest.

				kay (cont'd)
		especially you.

dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at
the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. kay steps away
from the group and finds him. he sits down next to him.

				dee
		i'm sorry. about...back there.

				kay
		happens.

				dee
		didn't used to.

he holds up his hands, which tremble with age.

				dee (cont'd)
		the spirit's willing, kay, but the rest of
		me...

he looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.

				dee (cont'd)
		they're beautiful, aren't they?

				kay
		what?

				dee
		the stars. we never just -- look. anymore.
			(back to kay)
		i'll tell ya, kay. i will miss the chase.

kay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.

				kay
		no. you won't.
