ext. leshko's diner - day

later, and the russian diner is now a crime scene, clustered with cops and
flashing lights. three bodies, now on stretchers and covered with sheets,
are being loaded into the back of ambulances.

rosenberg's cat races out of a uniformed cop's arms and leaps onto one of
the stretchers, meowing mournfully. the uniformed cop turns to a police
inspector who is questioning the woman from the diner.

				cop
		what am i supposed to do with the cat?

				inspector
		i don't know. send it with the stiff. let
		family claim it.

the cop nods and follows the stretcher with rosenberg's body into the back
of one of the ambulances, allowing the cat to ride on the chest of its
dead owner for the time being.

the doors of the wagon slam shut.
