int. morgue - day

the city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses
parked left and right. busy day in the apple. the cop wheeling the
stretcher calls out to the coroner, who's hunched over another body.

				cop
		where do you want contestant number three?

the coroner turns around. it's dr. laurel weaver, the woman who tried to
speak to jay before. she sighs and waves a hand.

				laurel
		by the wall, i guess.
			(noticing)
		what's with the cat?

				cop
		oh, the cat. there's a problem with the cat.
		sign here.

laurel signs his clipboard.

				laurel
		what's the problem with the cat?

				cop
		your problem.

laurel gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. she goes over to
the stretcher and bends down, petting rosenberg's cat gently.

				laurel
		are you having a bad day, baby?  cheer up.
			(of rosenberg)
		his is worse.

she sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights.

				laurel (cont'd)
		okey-dokey. shall we?
