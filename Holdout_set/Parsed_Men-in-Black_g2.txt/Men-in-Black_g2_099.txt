ext. world's fair - night

-- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in flushing
meadows. a taxi screeches to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards
away. edgar shoves laurel out through the driver's door and follows behind
her, still holding his weapon on her.

				edgar
		you're coming with me.

				laurel
		what?! why?!

				edgar
		it's a long trip. i'll need a snack.

and he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships.

behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the
front of the postcard he's been carrying around. "flushing meadows, site
of the 1964 world's fair," it says, with a distinctive photograph of the
spaceships.

so that's how he knew.
