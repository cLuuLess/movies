ext. gem and jewelry store - orkin van - day

a flap of skin, now getting gray and crusty with age, hangs off edgar's
neck as he sits in the front of his orkin van. he sucks as hard as he
possibly can on a straw stuck into a jolt cola ("double the sugar! triple
the caffeine!"), one of a six-pack that sits on the dashboard.

across the street, edgar sees a short, older man come out of one of the
jewelry shops on thirty-fifth street. edgar drops the soda and stares.

the older man (rosenberg), is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood
jewelry box. carefully, he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat
on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive
shop.

that finished, he picks up the cat, then the box, then waddles off down
the street, one under each arm.

edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along
behind him.

on the street, rosenberg walks happily along, humming to himself. he gives
his cat a little peck. as he rounds a corner, we recognize the tune he's
humming -- "i've got the whole world in my hands."

the orkin van rounds the corner behind him. following.
