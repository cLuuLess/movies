ext. world's fair - on jay - night

jay keeps moving toward the bug, finding new roaches to tread on -- holds
his foot over another one.

				jay
		what's that? can you hear what he's saying?
		'help me! help me!'

crunch. [on] the bug as he starts climbing down the tower and moving
toward jay.

on jay. they are moving toward each other in a show down -- jay moves on,
poising his foot over another roach.

				jay
		ooh! there's a pretty one. that one looks
		kinda familiar, don't you think? i know who
		that is!

the bug is right over jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.

				bug
		don't do that!

jay stares right back at the bug. inside, he sees kay's hand, closing
around the trigger of the shotgun. he brings it around, pointing up,
straight at the bug's head.

				jay
		that's your momma!

he moves to crunch the roach -- the bug moves to chomp jay -- jay stares
up at him, unflinching...

				jay (cont'd)
		didn't she ever teach you not to bite off
		more than you can chew?

and at that very moment...

kay blasts a hole right in the middle of the bug's midsection. the front
of the bug's thorax explodes in a shower of bug juice all over jay.

the bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end sailing one way; the head
flying behind jay.

kay falls out of the bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping
the atomizer from his slippery fingers.

the other gun sails off into the darkness.

the icon drops to the ground, rolls over to jay's feet, and clatters to
rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor.

he calmly bends down and picks it up. jay is pissed and starts in on kay.

				jay
		you son of a --

kay holds up a finger in a 'wait a minute' gesture -- pulls out his pocket
phone and hits a number.

				kay
		zed. get a message to the arquillians.  we
		have the galaxy.
