ext. battery park - day

edwards, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside kay on a
bench in battery park. kay drinks his coffee while they talk.

				kay
		any given time, around fifteen hundred
		landed aliens are on the planet, the
		majority right here in manhattan. most
		aliens are decent enough, just trying to
		make a living.

				edwards
		cab drivers?

				kay
		not as many as you'd think. humans, for the
		most part, don't have a clue. don't want
		one, either. they're happy. they think
		they've got a pretty good bead on things.

				edwards
		why the big secret? people are smart, they
		can handle it.

				kay
		a person is smart. people are dumb.
		everything they've ever "known" has been
		proven to be wrong. a thousand years ago
		everybody knew as a fact, that the earth
		was the center of the universe. five
		hundred years ago, they knew it was flat.
		fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans
		were alone on it. imagine what you'll know
		tomorrow.

				edwards
		so what's the catch?

				kay
		what you'll gain in perspective, you'll
		lose in ways you're too young to comprehend.
		you give up everything. sever every human
		contact. no one will know you exist. ever.

				edwards
		nobody?

				kay
		you're not even allowed a favorite shirt.
		there.  that's the speech i never heard.
		that's the choice i never got.

				edwards
		hold up. you track me down, put me through
		those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying
		to talk me out of it. i don't get it.

				kay
		you got 'til sun-up.

				edwards
		is it worth it?

				kay
		you find out, you let me know.
