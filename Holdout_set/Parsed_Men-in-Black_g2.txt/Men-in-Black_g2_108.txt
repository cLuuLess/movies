ext. midtown tunnel - mib ltd - night

as the ltd rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve,
its shape actually changing. the sides and back extend as some sort of
endoskeleton pushes the "normal" panels out. it becomes a larger, wirier
machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and
metallic tendons.

kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last
possible moment it swerves off to the side, a sucking sound coming from
underneath it.

instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the ltd actually clings to
it. it swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic
below.

it keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels
clinging to the roof of the tunnel.
