ext. 41st street and park avenue - night

a double-decker bus, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown
traffic. the bus, of course, is completely filled with japanese tourists,
and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.

edwards pushes through the crowd...

				edwards
		grand central station off to your left,
		folks...

with the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs
out through the side door.

he spots the perp, sailing east on forty-first street.

				edwards
		dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my
		gear!

edwards spots one of those new york post delivery trucks, the kind with
the open back door, rumbling by.  he runs and jumps into the back.
