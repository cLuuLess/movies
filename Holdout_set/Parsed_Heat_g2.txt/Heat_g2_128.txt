int. justine's bathroom - justine

putting on makeup. she's dressed up: short black dress,
fish net stockings.

                         hanna
             where we going?

                      hanna
              (continuing; acid)
          where are you going?

                       justine
          out.

hanna leaves. then justine looks at where he stood. her
cold demeanor cracks, then reassembles and she lights a
roach, takes a hit, dumps it in the toilet and finishes
her makeup.
