ext. chinese restaurant - neil - night

and everyone else exits from the restaurant, say their
goodbyes and go to their cars: neil's lincoln, chris's
seville, cerrito's sedan de ville, towner to a restored el
camino. we hear:   beep-beep-beep.

                      hanna (o.s.)
          a goddamn convention.

we hear a soft film advance and shutter.

                      casals (o.s.)
          who's "slick?"

pull back to reveal rear shots of hanna, drucker, casals
and a surveillance team on the roof across the street behind
some neon.

                      drucker
          cerrito, the wide one. he's
          hugged twice. one if he finds
          it behind the wheel wall. the
          back-up's in the firewall. we
          got their plates.

                      casals
          yeah.

                      drucker
          one with the hair is shiherlis.
          got a revolving tail and a tap
          on the house phone.

                      hanna
              (re neil)
          who's the big guy?

                      drucker
          first time we're seeing him.

hanna rolls away from his line of sight and says to his
men:

                      hanna
          next time this crew scores?
          when they walk in that door?
          they will get the surprise of a
          lifetime.

                                                  cut to:
