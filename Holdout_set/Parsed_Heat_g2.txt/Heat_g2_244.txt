ext. runway apron - long shot:

hanna

runs across the grass between the fence to the strobe
lights.

closer: hanna

among the   structures housing the ballasts for the lights.
the roar   of a 757's 95,000 lbs. of thrust beats an him.
he spins   to protect his face. his clothes and hair are
whipped.    as he runs to us ...

closer: hanna

looks up..

hanna pov: up into lights searching for neil. suddenly:

neil (slo mo)

is there. his .45 is up, centered into hanna's face.
he's eight feet away, framed against the glaring racks of
strobes.

neil's hand (slo mo)

squeezing the trigger, both eyes over the front sight,
moving laterally on target through the liquid air and
lights...

neil's .45 (slo mo)

as the trigger's squeezed and the sear's released and...

macro: the .45's hammer (slo mo) falling.

hanna (slo mo)

coming up with his 9mn.    he's too late...

neil

the hammer drops.    nothing.   his .45 misfires.

hanna (slo mo)

his 9mm.    coming up...

neil's hand (slo mo)

swipes across the .45's slide.

macro: the breech of neil's .45 (slo mo)

the misfired round, ejected and spinning away. the new
round, moving forward, the slide returning to battery...

hanna

fires three perfectly controlled, hammered-on shots.     his
front sight barely moved.

neil

hit three times in the chest - is blown back into the racks
of lights. he lies still.

hanna

approaches, slowly.    his gun hand drops to his side.

wide: neil + hanna

neil's   on the ground, his back against the rack. one arm
is in   his lap. the other is flung over the top bar of the
strobe   rack. neil looks at hanna and gestures with his
hand.    hanna takes it. neil holds on tight.

neil

last breath.

                        neil
            ...not half bad.

                        hanna
            ...pretty good your own self.

then neil's eyes dim.    and he dies.

long rear shot: hanna + neil

neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder. hanna still
grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at
the lines of blue runway lights like rivers. the two of
them stay there like that.
