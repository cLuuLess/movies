ext. wilimington oil fields - oil pump - day

widen. it's a desolate area - empty space. off in the
distance is a manufacturing plant and a billboard. pan
left and hold on cerrito's coupe de ville. it pulls down
the dirt access road, lurching up and down on its soft
shocks, and raising billows of tan dust. it stops. neil -
in a gray chamois jacket over a black t-shirt - gets out.
he hasn't shaved in a couple of days. chris and michael
cerrito get out the left side. they walk to camera and:

                       cerrito
           that the place?

                        neil
           yeah. you see how the road leads
           back around?

                        cerrito
           yeah.

                       neil
           that's the escape route...

very long shot: neil, cerrito and chris

the three men point. chris draws a map. then they climb
back into the sky-blue cadillac and drive away.

                         schwartz (o.s.)
           this is it.

pull back and reveal schwartz with binoculars and casals
with earphones. they had been surveilling neil and cerrito.
there's a tape recorder with a directional microphone in a
parabolic dish.

                        casals
           i know.   let's go!

wider

the two men run back from their observation position to an
unmarked car parked a hundred yards behind.

                                                  cut to:

same scene - wide - later - sunset

it's later. the camera pans the empty, desolate landscape
of oil pumps, dirt roads and a solitary billboard.

                       hanna (o.s.)
           what are they taking down out
           here?

pull back to reveal hanna, schwartz, casals and bosko.
hanna looks through binoculars.

                        casals
           they were looking at something
           southwest...

                       hanna
           what's's that down there?

                       casals
           an auto parts company. they're
           going to knock over a payroll?

                       schwartz
           the company only pays by check.

                        hanna
           maybe they're gonna steal the
           hub caps ...

o.s. we hear a click.

                       hanna
               (continuing)
           a billboard. oil pumps.     what
           the hell's goin' on?

                      schwartz
          that's what we were trying to
          figure.

angle on hanna

recognition dawns.

                      hanna
          i got an idea what they're looking
          at. you know what they're looking
          at?

hanna turns his back on the rest of the detectives and a
big smile dawns upon his face. he raises his arms out
wide. hanna turns in one direction, then another. schwartz
doesn't understand.

                      hanna
              (continuing; to
               schwartz)
          is that guy something; or is
          that guy something? i mean, you
          gotta give this crew credit.
          they are so fucking good...
              (beat)
          know what he's looking at?

very tight on hanna in 3/4 rear shot

the image vibrates. hanna says more. we don't hear it.
we hear a camera shutter click. the image focuses and
defocuses. another click.

                      hanna
          us. the l.a.p.d. the police
          department. we just got made...

hanna laughs.
