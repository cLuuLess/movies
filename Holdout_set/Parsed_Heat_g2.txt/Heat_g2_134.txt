          chris slipped his tail.      and
          chris doesn't talk about     jobs
          with charlene so there's     nothing
          for marciano to get from     her.

          i had coffee with mccauley half
          an hour ago. what happened?

                      casals
          our tail saw you. mccauley pulled
          into a car wash. car came out.
          he didn't.

hanna's got no one to call.      he throws the phone at the
wall.

                      hanna
          does anybody have any     idea where
          the fuck these people     are at?
          'cause whatever they     are gonna
          do, they are doing it     right now!

no one does.
