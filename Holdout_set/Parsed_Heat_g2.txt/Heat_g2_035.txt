whines, cries and charges into neil's shoulder from behind
and spins him around, wanting to explain to him. this
time:

neil

knees waingro in the stomach. waingro folds over. neil
slams both open palms on waingro's ears and knees him in
the face. waingro sprawls over a car hood and falls off.

closer - neil

kicks waingro in the side driving him between cars where
it is more secluded while cerrito and chris casually look
a-round and back away to cover him because they know neil
is going to kill him now. as neil draws his .45 ...

                         cerrito
              (low)
          hold it.

neil looks. across the street cruises a black and white.
he watches it pass. his attention goes back to waingro.
as his .45 comes up.

wider: neil

searches under cars, carefully.    nothing.
