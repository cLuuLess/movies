int. robert's coffee shop - on neil - day

he, cerrito and chris sit in a back booth. no one says
anything and they wait. there's the monotonous drone of
musak. neil watches the cook behind the high counter.

angle on kitchen - breedan

sees neil and nods.   neil waves.

                       neil
           where the hell's towner? i wanted
           to pass by early. i want to
           check the slot for the work car.

chris looks at the wall clock: 12:30.

solenko

crosses to cashier - an old lady with red lipstick.

               (re: neil, chris
                and cerrito)

                (crossing to grill)
            they think this a hotel?

solenko's pov: of neil, chris and cerrito

in the booth. they're tense. solenko doesn't know he
ought not to want to mess with them.

                        solenko (o.s.)
                (tough)
            twenty minutes, then i toss their
            asses out of here.
