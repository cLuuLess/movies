int. house - van zant

goes flying back.

neil

is four feet away. the big .45 automatic is aimed into
the center of van zant's chest.

                          neil
             waingro.   where is he?

                          van zant
                 (shouts)
             how the hell should i know?

neil pulls the trigger: two loud shots blow van zant back
into his foyer. he slides 15 feet across the highly
polished black and white tiled floor. neil walks away.
