ext. lax parking lot - wide between the cars - day

planes roar overhead in landings or takeoffs. yellow vapor
lamps glare. it's gaudy with lights. neil and a man named
nate are parked next to each other facing opposite
directions. nate's 50 - an ex-prize fighter with his nose
all over his face in a silver mercedes. his big muscles
have gone to flab. he wears a yellow rayon shirt. he's
deeply tanned and pock-narked.

nate functions as a middleman and fence for neil. all
calls from people who want to contact neil come to nate.
right now he examines the manila envelope from the armored
truck. neil's in a lincoln town car, gray suit, white
shirt, no tie.

close: envelope

contains 80 x $20,000 negotiable treasury certificates.
nate's counting.

                       nate
           a million, six at 40 cents onna
           dollar's 640. here's a hundred
           forty thou front money. get you
           the rest, 2-3 days.

wide - from the front

nate gives a large envelope to neil.

                       nate
           what happened out there?

                      neil
          i don't want to talk about it.

                      nate
              (re-examining
               securities)
          wait a minute.

                      neil
          what's the matter?

                       nate
              (laughs)
          you know who these belong to?

                      neil
              (takes manila
               envelope)
          "malibu securities ...

                      nate
          you know john van zant?

                       neil
          no.

                      nate
          malibu securities is a brokerage
          he controls. planned
          bankruptcies, made out during
          the s&l's, money laundering...

nate pulls t.c.'s.

                      nate
              (continuing; laughs)
          you ripped off his treasury
          certificates.

                       neil
          so what?

he's got insurance.

                      nate
          that's the point. on top of
          collecting his insurance, maybe
          he wants to buy back his bonds.
          from him i can get you 60 cents
          on the dollar instead of 40.
          means an extra 320 to you.

                       neil
          try it on.

          he's got this score he's putting
          out and wants you to look at.

                      neil
          what do i need look at his score
          for? i got my own.

                      nate
          he said you'll get near eight
          figures. very clean.

          9:00a.m. tomorrow.

                      nate
          take it easy.

neil starts the car.   nate pulls away in his mercedes.

an l1011 roars overhead.   neil pulls out.
