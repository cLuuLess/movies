int. polynesian bar, door lillian - night

enters. a tv mounted high in the corner broadcasts the
news with the sound off. a man in a motorcycle jacket
plays the pinball machine. it clicks, bells ring, lights
flash.

lillian

crosses to the bar and leans over.

                        lillian
            say, bartender... ?

bartender

rings up a sale, changing a $20.

                        bartender
            in a minute, lady.

lillian waits. behind and above her the newscaster cuts
from last coast storms to coverage of the bank robbery
aftermath: bullet holes in windows, cerrito's body,
breedan's body, etc.

lillian

sees none of it.   then: impatient:

                        lillian
                (shouts to bartender)
            you seen that fella i pulled out
            of here the other night? big
            fella with a beard?

more robbery aftermath plays across the screen.

bartender

at end of bar. finishes with the customer.       on his way to
lillian he turns up the tv volume.

                        tv announcer (v.o.)
            ...dead were michael t. cerrito,
            caucasian male and the driver,
            an unidentified black male in
            his early 30's, who died enroute
            to st. vincent's hospital...

as the bartender reaches her - widen to include lillian.
she stares at the television - stunned - at seeing david's
face on the paramedic stretcher in a freeze frame.

                        bartender
                (to lillian)
            what can i get you, ma'am?
                (she says nothing)
            lady, you okay.

she stares at the tv and holds onto the deep polished grain
of the bar.
