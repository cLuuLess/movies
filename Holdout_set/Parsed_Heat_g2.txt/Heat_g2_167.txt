ext. hawthorne - wide - sunset

it's the taped-off crime scene where michael cerrito
dropped. news media are all over. spectators mill.
emergency vehicles flashers spin. motorcycle cops re-route
traffic.

angle

the battered mercury wagon is still in situ, being dusted
by two technicians for prints. we hear a car pull in o.s.
and.

                        elaine (o.s.)
                (screaming; shouting)
            get out of my way!
                (shrieks; sobs)
            michael. michael. michael.
            michael!!!

elaine cerrito

knocks over a uniformed cop and runs down the sidewalk to
the chalked outline of cerrito's body on the cement and
lawn.

closer

another cop moves to stop her. she dodges him. disheveled,
screaming, hysterical - she throws herself on the bloodied
ground michael cerrito died upon and clutches at the outline
drawing of his body and blood stains as if it were him.

news cameraman

with lights moves in and tapes her. a police woman tries
to help elaine up. elaine bats her away.
