charlene ignores dominick playing at her feet as she watches
the news coverage of the bank robbery with her hand over
the mouth.

charlene

rises, picks up dominick, crosses to the phone. she punches
11 digits. we hear the phone ring on the other end.

                 (into phone)
            harry? if you want me, come
            right down and get me and dominick
            out.
