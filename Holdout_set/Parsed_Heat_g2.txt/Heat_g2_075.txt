driven by neil to camera appears and disappears up and
down the earthwork ramps. we don't know what he's doing
in one the last drive-in theaters in california at high
noon.

wide from the rear

the white screen reveals its cracks and patches.

close on entrance

a yellow full size dodge pickup with darkened windows
enters. it hesitates and then slowly drives toward neil -
up and the ramps between the speaker poles.

                        neil
            you keep your hands in sight! i
            tell you what to do, how to do
            it.

                         driver
            yessir.   i'm just the delivery
            boy.

                        rear shots
            of the two vehicles. out of the
            covered bed of the pick-up a
            small man slowly slips out.

man

crawls under the pick-up and   neil's car and emerges on the
passenger side behind neil's   rear wheel in neil's blind
spot. he inches towards the    window. he  carries a 15-shot
colt .22 woodsman with a huge   silencer.  he is totally
relaxed and professional.

neil

concentrates on the driver, who's calm.

                        neil
            now, with your right hand only:
            throw the envelope in my back
            seat.

driver

starts to reach for the envelope and tosses it into neil's
car.

neil

sees his eyes dart.    neil glances at his right rear view
mirror.

neil's pov: man

with the silenced .22.

wide from the front

neil floors the caprice and it catapults and bucks over
rows of ramps.

rear shot - man

pumps shots into the rear of the caprice.
