ext. food stand - hanna + neil - night

at a table. headlights stream by to and from the airport:
business people, families going on vacations, people living
normal lives who have never used guns to kill people, never
experienced physical violence, some who have never been
stolen from and never steal. surrounded on all sides by
this flow of normalcy:

                      hanna
          seven years in san quentin. in
          the hole for three. mcneil before
          that.

                       neil
          yeah.

                      hanna
          was mcneil as tough as they say?

                      neil
          you looking to become a
          penologist?

                      hanna
          you looking to go back? i chased
          some crews, the guys were lookin'
          to fuck up and get busted back.

                      neil
          you must have worked some dipshit
          crews.

                      hanna
          i worked all kinds.

                      neil
              (pause)
          you see me doing thrill-seeker
          liquor store holdups with a "born
          to lose" tattoo on my chest?

                      hanna

              (low threat)
          i am never going back.

the adversarial intensity is eye-to-eye.

                      hanna
          then don't take down scores.

                       neil
          i do what i do best. i take
          scores. you do what you do best
          trying to stop guys like me.
              (shrugs)

                      hanna
          you never wanted a normal-type
          life?

                      neil
          what the fuck is that?    barbecues
          and ballgames?

                      hanna
          that's part of it.

                         neil
          that's nice.     that your life?

                      hanna
          no. my wife spends half her
          time on the couch. my
          stepdaughter's got problems 'cause
          her real father's a world class
          asshole. and every moment i
          got, i'm chasing guys like you.

                      neil
          a man told me once: you want to
          make moves? don't keep anything
          in your life you're not willing
          to walk out on in 30 seconds
          flat if you feel the heat around
          the corner.
              (pause)
          so if you're chasing me and you
          gotta move when i move, how do
          you expect to keep a family?

                      hanna
          what are you, a monk?

                         neil
          no.
              (pause)
          i got a woman.

                      hanna
          what do you tell her?

                      neil
          she thinks i sell swimming pools.

                      hanna
          and if you spot me around the
          corner. you gonna walk out on
          her? leave her flat? like that?
          not even say goodbye?

                      neil
          that's the discipline.

                      hanna
          what you're left with is pretty
          empty.

                      neil
          yeah?
              (beat)
          then maybe you and me, we should
          both go do somethin' else, pal.

                      hanna
          i don't know how to do anything
          else.

                      neil
              (the shared
               confession)
          ...neither do i.

                      hanna
          and i don't much want to.

                      neil
          neither do i.

both of these guys look at each other and recognize the
mutuality of their condition. hanna's light laughter:

                      hanna
          we're sitting here like a coupla
          regular fellas. you do what you
          do. i do what i gotta do. what
          happens if i am there and i got
          to put you away?
              (pause)
          i won't like it. but, if it's
          between you and some poor bastard
          whose wife you're going to make
          into a widow, brother, you are
          gonna go down. 'cause you don't

                        hanna (cont'd)
            have to be there. you coulda
            gone and been a... a mailman.

                        neil
            there's a flip side to that coin.
            what if you got me boxed in and
            i gotta put you down?
                (beat)
            'cause no matter what, you will
            not get in my way.
                (beat)
            but now that we been face to
            face, i would not feel good about
            that. but i won't hesitate.
            not for one second.

                         hanna
                (smiles)
            maybe it'll happen that way.    or
            who knows ...

                         neil
            ...maybe we'll never see each
            other again.

they look at each other for a moment.      neil's wry smile.

                        hanna
                (to waitress)
            can we have the bill.

                                                      cut to:
