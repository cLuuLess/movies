ext. alley - wide on pavement - day

we're looking at chalk outlines of the bodies of guard one
and driver from the armored truck. the pavement is
bloodstained. bright lights illuminate the crime scene.

                      hanna (o.s.)
          where's the ambulance?

                      heinz (o.s.)
          they dumped it four blocks from
          here...

widen to reveal hanna who we now identify as a police
lieutenant of detectives. he's just arrived. the alley's
been roped off with sawhorses labeled "crime area." the
armored truck with the holed side is still there. one of
hanna's crew, drucker, a black intelligence analyst and
technician at 45, was already there. a uniformed sgt.
heinz was there first and by procedure took command. it's
his crime scene.

                      heinz
          masks, guns, radios - all left
          behind. no prints.

                      hanna
          what about the crash, the white
          towtruck.

two more of hanna's crew arrive in an unmarked car and
join him: casals - bald at 30 and wiry; bosko - a huge,
oversized man.

                      heinz
          hasn't turned up. got a witness:
          janitor next door.

                       hanna
          i.d. anybody? plate?
          description?

                      heinz
          shhaaapes ...
              (beat)
          one big. one thin.    he heard
          it...

guy's nearly blind.

                      hanna
              (re: body outlines)
          what about them?

                      drucker
          according to the janitor, he...
              (guard two outline)
          started mouthing off to one of
          the gunmen.

                      hanna
          oh, that was smart.

                       drucker
          i figure the other went for...
              (points)
          ... that gun when the shooting
          started. one guy called a guard
          "slick."

                       hanna
          "slick?"

                       drucker
          yeah.   and they ignored the loose
          cash.

               hanna
   'cause they had no time, cause
   they knew our response time,
   cause they were on our air.

               heinz
   you recognize their m.o.?

               hanna
   yeah. their m.o. is that they
   are good. once it escalated
   into a murder one beef for all
   of them after they killed the
   first two, they popped guard
   number three 'cause it didn't
   rake any difference anymore, so
   why leave a living witness?
   drop of a hat? they'll rock and
   roll. also: the way they went
   into the side indicates they are
   equipped to go in on the prowl.
   so also start looking for recent
   highline burgularies that have
   'mystified' us.
       (to drucker)
   run the "slick" bit to the fbi
   and see what it kicks out.

               drucker
   i called it in already.

               hanna
       (to casals)
   split the fences. i'll take
   cuzomano and torena. you take
   the east side. go through the
   tapes of who we been listening
   to.
       (to drucker)
   hang in with forensics on all
   physical evidence.
       (to bosko)
   how'd they know the route of the
   van and what it was carrying?
   does gage print the day's routes?
   what do they do with the
   printouts? who collects their
   trash? run makes on all their
   middlemanagement. did someone
   give this score up?
       (beat)
   check the three guards. see if
   one of them was a tipster.

                        bosko
           what's the vibe: home-grown or
           out-of-town?

                       hanna
           out-of-town. frankly, i hope
           they are scoring once and passing
           through. and i doubt it.

                       heinz
           this going to stay in area?

                       hanna
           this look like boosters working
           the local seven eleven to you?
           it goes to major crime.
               (to his crew)
           go to work.

they move toward the forensic unit, scraping tire rubber
and measuring distances as we

                                                  cut to:
