int. eady's house - eady - night

was in bed. now   she answers the door. the bamboo shades
are partly raised  revealing the l.a. basin - the city of
light. she wears   a red and black japanese kimono. neil
mccauley enters.   eady stares at him as he crosses to the
fridge and drinks  from a bottle of club soda.

                      eady
              (quietly)
          what did you do?
              (re tv)
          was that you?

                      neil
          it's what i don't do.
              (beat)
          i don't sell swimming pools. it
          would have been okay. you would
          have flown out after. you didn't
          need to do a thing. now i'm
          jammed. we got to go together.
          because we get dropped in a place
          and then i decide: new zealand
          or brazil or tunisia, whatever.
          i can't leave a string back here
          to where i am.

                      eady
              (confused)
          what.

he realizes he's way ahead of her.

                      neil
          i rob and steal for a living.
          do you understand?

                       eady
              (amazed)
          you killed people?

                      neil
          if they got in the way.    yes.
          it's their problem.

                      eady
          the woman on the grass...where
          her husband got shot..

          was my friend. he knew the risks.
          he didn't have to be there. he
          coulda been a...been a mailman.
              (he stops)

                      eady
          i don't believe it.

                        neil
          believe it.

she stares at him.

                      neil
              (continuing)
          eady. get packed.     get dressed.

eady runs out the door.
