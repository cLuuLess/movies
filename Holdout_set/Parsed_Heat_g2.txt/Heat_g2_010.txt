int. truck - wide - day

michael cerrito is the driver.

                         cerrito
          you waingro?

                         waingro
          yeah.

he climbs in. cerrito pulls out. waingro - delayed -
offers his hand. cerrito has to wait until he finishes
his gear change to shake it. the timing's a little weird.

                      waingro
              (continuing loud)
          you're cerrito huh?
              (pause)
          what kinda guy is this neil?

                         cerrito
              (loud)
          okay.

just do like he says.    exactly... like ... he ... says.

they have to talk loudly over the clapped-out engine's
noise.
