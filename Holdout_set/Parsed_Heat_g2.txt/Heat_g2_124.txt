int. nate's mercedes - two shot - traveling - day

vapor lights glide past. neil examines circuit diagrams
and architectural blueprints of the bank. next he unfolds
a pasted-together 180 degree view of the street.

                      nate
          worth it?

                      neil
              (impressed)
          there's enough circuit diagrams
          and blueprints here to build the
          bank.
              (beat)
          it's terrific.

neil puts the materials back in the case and snaps it shut.
next, nate hands neil a thick envelope. inside are the
pictures neil took of hanna and xeroxes of hanna's
employment records.

                      nate
          his name is hanna; first name,
          vincent. i smeared this sergeant
          in vice five yards. hanna's all
          over you. he's a hot dog.
          lieutenant in major crimes unit.
          he's taken down some heavy crews.
          blew away frankie yonder in
          chicago and he was a fucking
          maniac. was working narcotics
          before that. he's good, neil.
          dedicated. divorced three times.
          current wife's justine. he's
          why the extra heat.
              (pause)
          vice sergeant says hanna likes
          you. thinks you're some kind of
          'star.' 'you do this sharp, you
          do that sharp. look how sharp
          this guy is to figure that.'

neil laughs.

                      nate
              (continuing)
          funny as a heart attack.
              (pause)
          with this guy and this much heat,
          you should pass on the bank.

                         neil
             i've had heat before.

                         nate
             that's not the point.

                         neil
             this one's worth the stretch

                            nate
             you sure?

                          neil
             i'm sure.   drop me at the garage.
