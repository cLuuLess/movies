int. towner bathroom - on neil

through the crack in the door. he starts to push it open.
something blocks it. the water sounds are louder. neil
shines his light into camera.

neil's pov: wide - on the floor

towner is near death, beaten to a pulp. something or
someone is in the shower stall. blood's all over.

another angle

neil uses his penlight. he puts a towel under towner's
head. towner's face - against the white octagonal tile
floor - is a mess. he opens his eyes. tilt up to neil.

                            neil
          who?

                      towner
              (whispers)
          made me...anna...?

neil crosses to the shower stall and looks in.    he comes
back to towner.

                      neil
              (grim)

          guy who stood in...for you.

                      towner
              (whispers)

neil thinks. then:

                        neil

towner nods his head.

                      neil
              (continuing)
          you sure?

                      towner
              (nods; whispers)

              (implores; whispers)

neil can't get a straight answer.

                      neil

          the house clean?

towner nods.

              (continuing; rising)

and leaves.
