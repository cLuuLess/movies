entering door.

cooking sounds.    he stops.    frozen.

farina's pov:

a man

on his sofa watching his tv.      his name is ralph.

                        justine (o.s.)
                (ignorant of hanna's
                 presence; to ralph)
            it's ready...

justine

enters, sees hanna.

                       justine
                (cool)
            oh. meet vincent.

ralph sees hanna's 2" .38 in his waistband.

                        ralph
                (continuing)
            oh, my god...

                        hanna

hanna's reaction to ralph is vacant of emotion.

                      hanna
          i'm vincent hanna.

                      justine
          don't you even get angry?

                      hanna
              (to justine)
          i'm angry.
              (to ralph)
          ralph, you can ball my wife.
          you can lounge around her $1.7
          million condominium on her sofa.
          you can do all those things.
          but you do not get to watch my
          fucking tv...!

hanna lifts it off the table, spilling framed pictures.   a
commercial segues to a quiz show.

                      hanna
              (continuing; to
               justine)
          i've never screwed around. i've
          been true blue to you since the
          day we met.

                      justine
          it would have been preferable if
          you had! you made me do this!

                      hanna
          right i had ralph fuck you 'cause
          it makes me feel so good.

                      justine
          put down the television. you
          look ridiculous.
              (he doesn't)
          dr. prince says i'm trying to
          get your attention. christ! i
          have to pay someone to figure
          out my life with you.

                      ralph
          maybe i should...

                      hanna
          shut up!

                      justine
          why's it my job to figure it all
          out and explain it to you?

                      hanna
          'cause you're the one who spends
          all the time on the couch.

                      justine
          and what do you do?

                      hanna
          what do i do? i speak the english
          language. words. sentences
          even.

                      justine
          how admirable: proletarian candor.

                       hanna
          thank you.

                      justine
          except you don't say a damned
          thing. you neglect me. you
          don't call. i can worry about
          you or not. so i withdraw. you
          don't notice. you're walking
          through our life chloroformed,
          vincent. wake up. it's almost
          over.

she unplugs the tv. the image hanna's holding dies.   hanna
looks at her and leaves.
