ext. eady's house, balcony - neil + eady - night

the house is high in the hill's over sunset. they stare
down at the city - like an ocean of small lights. from
the previous scene we hear:

                        eady (v.o.)
            the plates are mezzotints. they
            evoke a feeling japanese painters
            called "sabi". they believed
            there were eight scenes of
            transcendental loneliness. they
            painted them over and over again.
            one is a flock of geese hovering
            over a field. there's always
            mist. it's painted just as the
            leader touches down.

pause.    they drink scotch in highball glasses.

                        neil
            city of lights.

                         eady
          yeah.

                      neil
          i flew over the arctic once at
          40,000 feet. the moonlight was
          blue on all the snow. it felt
          like that.

there's a long pause.    then:

                      eady
          do you travel a lot?

                         neil
          yeah.

                      eady
          are you lonely?

                        neil
          i'm alone.    not lonely.

he pulls her closer.    a pre-dawn red band cracks the
horizon.

                         neil
                 (continuing)
          you?

                      eady
          i get lonely.

his hands hold her face as he looks into her eyes and she
moves to him.

                                                dissolve to:
