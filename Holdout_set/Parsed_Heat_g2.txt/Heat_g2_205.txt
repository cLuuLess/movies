ext. pacific palisades cliffs - two shot- twilight

the sun is setting beyond point dume. neil and eady are
at the edge of the sea cliff. he checks his watch. he
looks cut at the sky. he wears clothes eady bought.

the swells rock a few small boats near the reef: pan right.
the sun is gone. the sky to the left the bulk of a 747
rises over the ocean slowly, as if gravity didn't exist.

                       neil

           i don't even know how to think
           like this...cause this has
           happened to me late in my life.
           but i got some expectations.
           for us. you can walk right now

           you...on your own...you choose

           in there to take care of us for
           forever.
