              (counts the money)
          where's the rest?

                       chris
          that's it.

                      charlene
          eight thousand dollars?   you
          gotta be kidding me!

chris enters from the bedroom. while buttoning a shirt,
he's mostly oblivious. it frustrates the hell out of
charlene.

                      chris
              (off-handed)
          i squared the bookies and we had
          to pay off some guy and were
          short to start 'cause the rest
          is comin', in a coupla days. so
          don't sweat it.
              (checks watch)
          we're late.

slips on a boot.

                      charlene
          listen to me. "as the world
          turns" can get interrupted with
          a news flash of you splattered
          all over the street ...

pulls on boot two.

                      charlene
              (continuing; running
                on)
          i can get sent up on an accessory
          beef. your son, dominick, winds
          up in a home. for $8,000?
              (voice breaks)
          honey, for $8,000, it ain't worth
          the risk. risk versus reward?
          baby?

                      chris
          don't worry about money. neil's
          got...
              (checks watch)
          hey, if we're goin', let's go.

                      charlene
          where's the club you were going
          to open?

          here comes the "showgirl with a
          future" bit.

                      charlej
          shut up! i left for a good thing.
              (beat)
          why am i even talking to you? i
          can't talk to you. all you are
          is a child growin' older...

                      chris
          the hell's that mean?

                      charlene
          it means we're not making forward
          progress like real adults and
          you won't listen.

                      chris
          i told you: me and neil got
          planned ...

                      charlene
          "me and neil." i'm married to
          you, now. this isn't the fucking
          joint.

                      chris
          don't mouth off to me!

                      charlene
              (screams)
          i want out of here!

                       chris
              (shouts)
          well there's the fucking door!
              (opens it)
          only leave dominick, the bank
          book and the car keys on the
          kitchen table!

                      charlene
          you can keep that other crap!
          but dominick goes with me.

chris shoves her up against the wall.

                      chris
              (suddenly low)
          i'll find ya and kill you, you
          bitch, wherever you are - you
          ever try to take dominick away
          from me.

he means it. she knows it. he takes the car keys and
goes. she's frozen to the spot.
