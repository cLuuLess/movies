                      neil
              (holds her close:
               looks at her face)
          come away with me.

                      eady

          new zealand.

                            eady
          when?

                            neil
          soon.

                      eady
          you're kidding.

                      neil
          what's stopping you?     what's
          here?

                       eady
              (laughs)
          i don't know you.

                      neil
          what's to know?

                      eady
          are you married?

                            neil
                 (laughs)
          why?

                      eady
          way you come and go.

                      neil
          i deal with state officials.
          county. weird hours. a lot of
          traveling, entertaining.

                      (beat)
          the last thing i am is married.

there's a pause, then:

                      eady
          you don't know me at all, neil...

                      neil
          i know enough.

                      eady
          my father wanted me to marry
          someone in taipei. it was like
          i was a piece of furniture: "go
          be his wife." after i left he
          won't talk to me. because i
          went on my own. i can't let
          people tell roe what to do again.
          and that trust comes from knowing
          someone over time.
              (avoids neil)
          this is hard between us for me.
          because i like you very much.

neil looks right into eady's face.

                      neil
          i have to leave. come away with
          me.
              (beat)
          no one will ever tell you what
          to do... you'll never lose
          yourself with me.

she believes him.   so do we.
