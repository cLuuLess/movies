int. 1403 - door

smashes into waingro. neil hits the door again and it
smashes into waingro a second time.

neil

reaches around, grabs waingro by the arm, dislocates his
shoulder, breaks his collarbone and throws him across the
room. waingro's gun goes flying.

waingro

on the sofa, seeing neil mccauley. he feels his internal
organs drop through the floor. he looks away.

                         neil
             i should have dumped you in that
             parking lot. look at me, you
             sick fuck.

waingro won't look at neil.

                         neil
                 (continuing)
             gimme your eyes. 'cause you're
             gonna die.

waingro, pathetically, obeys and looks up.      neil's .45
explodes twice.

closer: neil

now looks out the window, searching.

neil's pov: high rise across the street + "painter" two

staring at neil through the nite vision scope, disbelieving.
neil sees "painter" one is shouting into his police radio...
