int. mercury wagon - cerrito - day

breedan at the curb on a residential street off hawthorne
in view of the bank. cerrito from a paper bag hands out
three h & k model 53 small machine-guns and gives breedan
a .45 and two extra clips.

close shots

neil, chris   and cerrito wear their stubby weapons concealed
under nylon   shell jackets on shoulder straps. they shove
into place   the curved clips, and release the top bolts,
jacking the   first rounds into chambers.

neil

checks his watch.

                         neil
                 (with finality)
             drop us in the slot.   let's take
             it down.

the mercury wagon pulls from the curb.

cerrito

checks and he re-checks his gun.

breedan

drives. cool. unharrassed. his own ran, performing the
simple and critical task of driving a station wagon and
obeying perfectly every single rule of the california
vehicle code.
