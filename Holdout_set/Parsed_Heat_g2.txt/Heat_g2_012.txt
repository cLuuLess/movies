int. truck - cerrito

lights a cigarette. belatedly, he offers one to waingro.
waingro lights up. the two men relax under the swirls of
blue smoke.

                      waingro
          you guys always work together?

                      cerrito
          all the time.

                      waingro
          real tight crew, huh?

                      cerrito
          that's right.

awkward pause.

                      waingro
          this works good, maybe i could
          go again?

cerrito looks at waingro.   he wants to protect his
concentration.

                       cerrito
          yeah.   stop talking, slick...

it ends the conversation. waingro drums his fingernails
on the dash. he's anxious.

chevy towtruck - on towner - day

towner's a sloppy, nondescript man in his 40's. he slouches
behind the wheel. a bearcat 210 scanner is under the dash
and a walkie-talkie on the seat. as in the garbage truck,
it's quiet and he waits. then:

                      neil (v.o.)
              (radio filter)
          you ready if i need you?

                      towner
              (into radio; low)
          yeah.

                      neil (v.o.)
              (radio filter)
          got their air?

                       towner
          yeah.

at a low level we hear police calls.
