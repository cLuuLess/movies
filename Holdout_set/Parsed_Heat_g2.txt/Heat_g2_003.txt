ext. r & c construction supplies - on chris - day

chris shiherlis crosses past stacks of gravel and cement
with a white-coated black clerk. chris wears a hard hat
over a mongol cut, levi's, black boots and a sleeveless
sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,
milwaukee tool company case. he looks like a construction
worker by day who by night hits l.a's slams, jams and raves.
he's 29, from austin, texas. chris is also a highline
pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.
right now he's buying a hollow core drill. he and mccauley
were cellmates in san quentin penitentiary from 1984 to
1987. chris hit the streets in 1988. he's a hot dog and
spends money as fast as he makes it. right now, he and
the clerk exit to the sales counter.
