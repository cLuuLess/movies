he looks like hell. neil puts his browning on the table.

                         chris
             my mouth tastes like a sewer.

chris crosses to the sink and turns the dish sprayer onto
his face and the back of his neck.

                         chris
                 (continuing; comes
                  down)
             charlene's going to leave me.

             freezer.

          jimmy - whatsisname - bohunk, in
          the joint used to say: "on the
          street you wanna be makin' roves,
          you don't put anything in your
          life you can't walk out on in 30
          seconds flat if you spot heat
          around the corner."

                      chris
          jimmy banghart. and to hell
          with jimmy banghart.
              (beat)
          i'd rather go ten rounds with
          jesus christ than fuck with her.
          but she and dominick save my
          life, man; everyday. everyday...

committed to making it work.
