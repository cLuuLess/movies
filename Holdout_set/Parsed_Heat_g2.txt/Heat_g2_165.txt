int. dr. bob's office - dr. bob - day

washes his hands in the sink. neil sits on his desk.     a
tv plays news footage from bosnia.

                      doc
          blood loss and shock and he'll
          have a lot of pain in the shoulder
          and back, but i'll give you
          quarter-grain phials of morphine.
          subcutaneous injections.

                      neil
              (nods)
          what's the bottom line?

                      dr. bob
          missed the carotid artery by
          millimeters. there is mostly
          tissue damage. and the collar a
          bone's smashed. can he rest
          awhile?

                      neil
          six, seven hours.   what do i owe
          you?

news coverage switches to scenes from the robbery with the
commentator in a window.

                      dr. bob
          it's got to be twenty thou.

                      neil
          what is this?

                      dr. bob
          you're number one with a bullet
          on the six o'clock news. it's
          at least double the risk. so
          i'm doubling my price.

neil opens a shopping bag and stacks packets of bills.
news coverage switches to sports and weather.

                      neil
          you're wrong. it's four times
          the risk. 'cause something happens
          to him, i'm coming back for you.
          and i'm double the worst trouble
          you ever had.

bob looks at neil's eyes and believes it.
