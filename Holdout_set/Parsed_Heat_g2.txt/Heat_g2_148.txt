int. bank - on street door - day

neil and chris enter the street door. chris lingers by
the guard. he reads a rosicrucian handout. they smile at
each other. neil approaches the window of teller john
fiske.

on side door

cerrito enters and hesitates to tie his shoe near guard
frank magid.

neil

in line, waits: an old lady finishes and leaves.

                         john
                 (to neil)
           hi!

                          neil
           hi!

can i borrow your pen, john?

                          john
               (smiles)
           sure thing!

john reaches into the side jacket pocket.

neil

pulls his stocking mask down over his face. he reaches
over the counter and grabs smiling john fiske's lapels and
yanks him over the counter top and throws him across the
floor. meanwhile:

                       cerrito
           say, frank...?

magid turns. cerrito saps him expertly on the right
shoulder, paralyzing his gun arm, spins him and swipes the
sap across his neck. meanwhile:

chris

has smashed guard one in the stomach with the h & x -
doubling him up. now he braces him against the wall,
disarms and handcuffs him. he jerks on his stocking mask.

wide - the bank

there are two female tellers and four customers. neil
moves toward the bank officers at their desks, specifically,
while bringing up his h & k.

                       neil
               (very nicely)
           ladies and gentlemen!  we are
           holding up this bank.
               (continuing)
           we want to hurt nobody.  you do
           exactly like we say and you come
           away okay. we're here  for the
           bank's money, not your money...

timmons

with neil approaching, frantically stomps the alarm button
under his desk.

                       neil
           ...you people behind the windows:
           the salaries this bank pays aren't
           big enough to take risks for, so
           think of your take-home pay before
           you risk your life.

faces

of tellers and customers. scared, but neil's monologue
holds their attention. throughout he's approaching timmons.

                       neil
               (to customers -
                like a commercial)
           ...don't forget your money is
           insured by the federal government.
           you're not going to lose a penny.
           relax and you'll get through
           this okay.

                         neil (cont'd)
                 (nice)
             any of the ladies feel ill or
             anybody with heart trouble wants
             to sit down, go right ahead.

he smiles.

neil

reaches timmons.

                            neil
                 (smiles)
             the key.

                            timmons
             what key?

neil slams a punch into timmons' face in calculated contrast
to his friendliness. it's an object lesson to customers
of the result of disobeying. timmons flips backwards over
his chair.

neil

hauls him up, rips open his white shirt and pulls the key
an a lariat off his neck.

                         neil
             don't touch your face.   let it
             bleed.

the white shirt is already splattered with blood.        customers
watch. they do not want this to happen to them.

cerrito

pulls a straight razor and leans over guard magid. he
slits his pants leg and pocket open and extracts the other
key and it.

pan 0n key

through the air and is caught by chris.        throws timmons'
key. pan it to chris.

chris

spins the ring handle for five seconds. the massive round
vault door opens. it reveals a second, rectangular door.

cerrito

handcuffs magid.    handcuffs timmons to his chair.
