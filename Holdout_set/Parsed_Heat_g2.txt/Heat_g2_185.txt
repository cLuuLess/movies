                        hanna
                (to bosko; sarcastic)
            he's the burglary cop with the
            "terrific tip?"

                           bosko
            yeah.

                           dieter
            who are you?

                         hanna
            hanna.   where'd it come from?

                        dieter
                (defensive)

            you got...

hanna kicks a chair out of the way and bounces dieter up
against the wall. bosko starts to restrain him.

                        hanna

            got no liver. he's dying. don't
            come on to me with "confidential
            source" crap!

he slams dieter into the wall.

                         dieter
                (shouts)
            hugh. hugh benny.       he gives me

hanna's gone.    bosko follows.
