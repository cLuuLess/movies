int. early 60's coffee shop - wide - night

it's 1963 futuristic: flagstone and rubber plants. most
of the patrons are night people: pimps, hookers, customers,
disintegrating couples, etc. we pan around the interior
and settle on a booth by a window. in the booth are chris
and cerrito on one side and waingro alone.

                       waingro
           anybody want some pie?

cerrito

looks at waingro, sips his coffee, and looks away again
waingro is nervous.

chris

sees something in the parking lot.

door - neil

enters, crosses to the booth, slides in across from waingro.

close

the four men huddle together and talk in a whisper. neil
pulls out three yellow envelopes, presumably full of money.
neil will talk about waingro in the third person as if he
inanimate.

                        neil
                (whispered)
            this is a partial   split, but i
            took out of ours   - every - to
            make up...
                (waingro's)
            ...his full end.    because i want
            to settle him up   and get rid of
            this jagoff right   now.

cerrito and chris looks at waingro.

                        cerrito
            okay.

chris nods.    waingro's speechless.   neil flips him an
envelope.

                        neil
                (whispering)
            fuck off.

waingro doesn't move.

                        waingro
                (whispered; tense)
            i had to dust him!

neil grabs the back of waingro's neck, slams the side of
his face onto the table top and flicks the middle finger
of his left against waingro's temple. neil could kill
him.

                        neil
                (whispered)
            electricity and chemicals a little
            fucked up?
                (flick)
            you a shooter? speed? what?

flick.    cerrito looks around the coffee shop: it's quiet.

                        neil
                (continuing;
                 whispered)
            you didn't have to. now we got
            extra heat off a clean score.

waingro does nothing. neil shoves him into the corner of
the booth. plates fall. all three get up and walk out.

                                                     cut to:
