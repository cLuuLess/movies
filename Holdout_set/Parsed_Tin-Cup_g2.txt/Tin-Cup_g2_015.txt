24   int. back room - night                                      24

     romeo scoops balls into wire buckets from the garbage can
     of water where the balls are washing. tin cup sits on a
     bench, alternately swigging cheap whiskey and maalox.

                                                         28.
                        tin cup
          if i had it all to do over, i'd
          still hit that shot.

                        romeo
                 (nods with neither
                  rancor nor irony)
          the look comes over your face, you
          would bury yourself alive to prove
          you can handle a shovel.

tin cup looks over at romeo for signs of an implied
pejorative. but romeo's just washing and scooping
balls... and looking badly in need of perspective.

                        tin cup
          you know why i'd still hit that
          shot?

now romeo looks over... and he decides that tin cup is
the one in need of perspective.

                        romeo
          'cuz it's the only way you can
          beat david simms. 'cuz you never
          got over that he is on tour and
          you are not. 'cuz you get that
          look on your face...

                        tin cup
          no...
                 (pauses, adding
                  weight to his
                  thoughts)
          i'd hit it again because that shot
          was a defining moment. and when a
          defining moment comes along you
          define the moment or the moment
          defines you. i did not shrink
          from the challenge. i rose to it.

romeo nods, holding his peace.

                        romeo
          1981, fort washington golf club,
          fresno, california, final round of
          the tour qualifying school...

tin cup cringes at the memory, then moves for the high
ground.

                        tin cup
          i was playing to win.

                        romeo
          a defining moment when you tried
          to hit the same impossible cut

                                                               29.
               three wood into the wind from a
               hilly lie -- four in a row out of
               bounds -- until you finally pulled
               it off and tapped in for a
               thirteen.
                      (beat)
               when a twelve woulda got you on
               the tour! that was a defining
               moment and the definition was
               shit!

                             tin cup
               greatness courts failure, romeo.
               that's why most people, in their
               whole lives, never ever reach for
               the brass ring, never know when to
               dig deep and try for the
               impossible shot...

                             romeo
               you're right about that, boss, but
               sometimes... sometimes... par is
               good enough to win.

     tin cup tosses down another maalox cocktail.

                                                    cut to:
