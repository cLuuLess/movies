129   ext. third green - day                                      129

      molly and doreen stand together behind the big gallery.
      molly is using a cardboard periscope to look over the
      gallery to the green. doreen is on her tip-toes but all
      she can see are the backs of heads.

      a swell of cheers builds, then turns to groans.

                               molly
                 oh no, tin cup ran it five feet
                 past.
                        (beat)
                 how did he get the name 'tin cup'?

                               doreen (o.s.)
                 he played catcher on the high
                 school baseball team. the star
                 pitcher had this big-league curve,
                 and not all his pitches hit roy
                 in the mitt. finally, you gotta
                 respect a man's doggedness. you
                 know?
                        (beat)
                 the team decided tin cup sounded
                 better than clank.

      molly puts down the periscope at that remark, and hands
      it to doreen.

                               molly
                 'clank''s not a good name for a
                 man...

                                                                 119.

      doreen looks through the periscope.


      periscope's pov - tin cup

      lining up a putt.   she pans over to romeo helping him.

                              doreen (v.o.)
                tell me something, molly... have
                you ever had a latin lover?
