    tin cup enters, cash in hand, as the regulars all gather
    excitedly around the tv monitor now coming in.

                            tin cup
              a class act there, boys --
              probably the first actual `lady
              type' female ever seen on these
              premises --

                            romeo
              shut up, boss -- we got the corpus
              christi dog track on the dish --

                            earl
              this is yer dead mortal cinch lock
              bet with do-reen.

    everyone's glued to the set. a greyhound race comes on
    from a remote texas track on the gulf.

                            tin cup
              free money, boys, what does
              doreen know about the fine art of
              greyhound breeding?

                            romeo
              all she knows is she likes the
              three dog 'cause his name is
              pride of odessa 'cause she's
              from odessa.

                            tin cup
              get ready for oddessa-lation, boys.
              how deep we in?

                            romeo
              you gave her twenty to one --

                            earl
              it's only fifteen to one on the
              toteboard --

                            tin cup
              yeah, but i got every other dog
              in the race. i'm just getting
              even with doreen -- i'm not
              trying to clean her clock.

                            clint
              so how much you stand to lose?

                            romeo
              twelve thousand.

                                                           13.

                        tin cup
          hundred.

                        romeo
          thousand.

                        tin cup
                 (panicky)
          hundred.

                        romeo
          you said to shoot the wad.

                        tin cup
          i said get even, pod. i didn't
          say shoot the wad. we better see
          that three dog rolling on his ass.

all eyes on the monitor -- the dogs break.

                        earl
          except... if he breaks slow, he
          won't get creamed...

the starting box opens -- "there goes the rabbit" -- the
three dog breaks slow and trails down the front stretch.

                        regulars
          three dog's dying, t.c.... easy
          money... (etc.)

the one dog veers wide, going into the escape turn,
annihilating the field. dogs fly ass over teakettle
like bowling pins, and --

                        regulars
          uh-oh.

the three dog clears the pileup, untouched, hugging the
rail. it has a ten length lead as it moves down the
backstretch and past the toteboard. the race is over --
the three dog wins.

deathly silence. somebody flips off the tv. finally,
in a lame attempt to lighten the moment, romeo speaks --

                        romeo
          so, roy, you were saying you
          felt a little flutter for this
          doctor lady?

                        tin cup
          yes, i was saying that... just
          before i was interrupted by...
          bankruptcy -- a development that
          the 'doctor lady,' as you call her,

                                                                   14.
              will consider utterly predictable.

                                                   cut to:
