15    ext. cottonwood - 16th fairway - day                       15

      a leader board reads:   simms/stadler -10, mickelson/
      mccord -8.

      a giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant
      green which is fronted by a lake, as:

      stadler hits a three wood toward the green -- the ball
      plunks in the middle of the lake. the gallery groans.

      stadler just shrugs to simms, as if to say, "i thought i
      had enough club."

                              simms
                like i told you, it was more'n
                you had in the bag.

                              stadler
                yeah, well... i had to go for it
                after your caddy said he could
                get home from here.

      simms swivels his head around to look at tin cup.

                               tin cup
                i could.

      simms looks away, at the shot he's facing: a two hundred
      fifteen yard carry over water. he looks back at tin cup,
      shaking his head.

                              simms
                i gotta hand it to you, roy. for
                fifteen holes you've seemed to
                grasp the concept here: i'm
                trying to win and your job is to
                help me.

                                                            23.
                        tin cup
          five percent of your earnings does
          numb the gag reflex.

                        simms
          give me the seven iron.   i'm
          laying up.

                        tin cup
          you can make that shot.

                        simms
          the smart play's to lay up.

                        tin cup
          these fans didn't pay thirty bucks
          to watch a tour star lay up on a
          short par five.

                        simms
          i'm sitting on a two shot lead
          with three to go, and my partner's
          in his pocket. suddenly, par's a
          good number. gimme the seven
          iron.

                        tin cup
          no way. you're going for the
          green. these fans paid good money
          to see golf shots they can't hit,
          not golf shots they feel shitty
          about themselves for having to
          hit.

simms reaches for the seven iron.   tin cup clamps a hand
over the club.

                        tin cup
          thirteen years on tour and you're
          still a pussy. hit the fucking
          one iron, dave.

                        simms
          thirteen years in a driving range
          and you still think this game's
          about your testosterone count.

simms removes tin cup's hand from the seven iron and
grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball. tin cup
mutters to the gallery.

                        tin cup
          two-fifteen to carry, and the tour
          star's laying up.

and the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging
simms to go for the green. simms motions for tin cup, as

                                                               24.
     if reconsidering.

                             simms
               but if you're gonna editorialize,
               do it on the other side of the
               ropes. i got no qualms about
               firing your ass right here, right
               now.

                              tin cup
               fire me?   hell, i should fire you.

     simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron, and:


16   stadler's still standing back where he hit the shot into  16
     the lake. mickelson and gary mccord, the other team in
     the pairing, are there with him. romeo, stadler's caddie,
     stands just behind them.

                              mccord
                      (to mickelson)
               i know you could knock it on from
               here, i'm just saying that caddie's
               been drinking muddy water if he
               thinks he can.

                               romeo
               he can.

     all the players look at romeo as:

     simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of
     the water to a smattering of polite applause.

     simms tosses the club back to his bag as tin cup
     retrieves the divot. and:

                              stadler
               hey, dave!   we in a hurry?

     simms looks several yards back where stadler is still
     standing with mccord and mickelson.

                             stadler
               'cause i just bet mccord and
               mickelson that your caddie could
               knock it on from here.

                             simms
               we're trying to win a tournament,
               pardo.

                               stadler
               i know.    but i'm getting five to
               one.

                                                                  25.
