97   int. clubhouse bar - sunset                                  97

     simms enters to numerous congratulations from officials,
     caddies, other players. instantly, in public, he feigns
     humility with convincing flair.

                             player #1
               helluva round, dave!

                                                            99.

                           simms
             got lucky out there...

                           player #2
             great start, simmsy...

simms stops when he sees tin cup and romeo drowning their
sorrows.

                           simms
             hey, tin cup -- heard you put a
             monster number up there...

                           tin cup
             coulda been worse...

a small bar crowd is enjoying simms' taunts.

                           simms
             i played in the pro-am with some
             asshole movie star shot 82 here
             once... how did a great ball-
             striker like you, a `legend,'
             manage to shoot an 83?

                           tin cup
             i missed a four foot putt on the
             eighteen for an 82, that's how...

                           simms
             it ain't like playing some muni
             track in brownsville, is it?

a voice interrupts.

                           molly
             does, `integrity, tradition, and
             honor' include kicking a man when
             he's down?

                           simms
             oh, mol', this is just guy stuff,
             bar talk, part of the game -- no
             offense, right, cup?

no answer.    tin cup's about as low as one can go.

                           molly
                    (defensively)
             this man still has a lot of good
             golf shots in his system --

                           tin cup
                    (trying to hide)
             molly, it's okay, go away... i
             don't need any attention right

                                                           100.
          now...

                        some guy at the bar
                 (to tin cup)
          you the guy shot 83?!

                        molly
          david, i'll bet you a hundred
          dollars right now that roy here
          can hit a ball --
                 (looks around)
          -- from right here to... through
          that door to the patio...

she points to a double door, forty feet away across, the
bar, about an 8 x 8 foot opening.

                        tin cup
          molly, please...

                        molly
                 (to bartender)
          and give me a vodka tonic with a
          twist --

                        simms
          molly, really, this isn't...
          dignified...

                        molly
          roy?

                        tin cup
          i wanta go back to texas...

                        molly
          what about the river, the piranha,
          the immortality? all that
          bullshit? you gonna drag your ass
          home with an 83?
                 (looks around)
          in fact, two hundred says he can
          hit it through that door, over the
          patio, into the river, and make
          that pelican fly off that post.

everyone strains to look --


pov - about 170 yards away

a pelican sits on a piling in the river.   impossible.


back to scene

                                                            101.
                        simms
          this is ridiculous...

but romeo's sizing it up.

                        romeo
          you got that shot, pods, hood the
          seven, turn it over, start it low,
          right to left...

molly takes a swig of her drink and slaps some money on
the bar.

                        molly
          i'm not leaving till one of you
          men starts acting in a manly
          fashion.

simms puts a hundred dollar bill on the counter.

                        simms
          let's just get this over with.
          one ball, one swing, one gull.

                         molly
          roy?

tin cup still sits, head half buried at the bar. he's
never passed up such an opportunity, but he's pretty low.

                         romeo
          you the man.

he turns from his bar stool, glances at the situation.

                         tin cup
          one swing?   four to one odds.

                        simms
          i'll make it ten to one. stick it
          up your ass. i'm leading the
          open.

                        molly
          now we're talking! manly men!

whoas! from the barside gallery. tin cup rises and
someone hands him a club. suddenly there's a crowd,
including gary mccord who's been watching from the far
end of the bar. he grabs a seltzer hose as if it's a
mike and begins announcing.

                        mccord
          ... he's looking at thirty yards
          of bar and grill, an opening
          through the french doors, forty
          yards of patio umbrellas, a

                                                                102.
               hundred yards of water, and a
               lonely pelican sitting out there
               in a 15 mile an hour breeze, south
               by southwest...
                      (beat)
               he'll probably try to shut down a
               four iron -- no, he's selected his
               trusty seven iron...

     tin cup steps up to a ball lying on the carpet.

                             tin cup
               kind of a thin lie...

                             simms
               beats all that deep rough you were
               in today...

                             romeo
               fore in the grill! fore on the
               patio! you're the legend, boss...

     tin cup suddenly backs off the swing and turns to molly.

                             tin cup
               what is this all about?

                             molly
               shut up and hit the ball.

                             mccord
                      (on "mike")
               the ledge still has to be thinking
               about that brutal, ego-sapping,
               manhood-robbing eighty-three he
               buried himself under yesterday. i
               mean, that's just an avalanche of
               golf swings, a landslide, a
               pyroclastic flow --

                             tin cup
               dollar bills...


98   and he swings -- the ball rockets through the hall and     98
     clears the open door...

     the bettors pile from the bar and grill and race to the
     patio to watch the flight of the ball, as --

     it's carrying, it's hooking, it's carrying, then:

     thwack! -- it hits the piling!    the seagull lifts off,
     screeching angrily.

                             romeo
               stiff, baby, stiff!

                                                                  103.


99    a whoop goes up -- and simms storms out.                    99

                              simms
                i'm outta here. you're all nuts.

                              molly
                i musta been blind thinking you
                were worth a shit, simmsy!
                       (raucously)
                drinks on me, boys! helluva shot,
                roy!

                              tin cup
                actually i thinned it a little or
                that pelican'd be flying around
                with a titleist up his ass...

      this is the old tin cup -- and he's in the clubhouse with
      an eightyfuckingthree.

                                                     cut to:
