     tin cup hangs up the phone and turns to romeo.

                             tin cup
               man, ever since i let her dump my
               ass she just can't resist kicking
               me in it.

                             romeo
               maybe you should treat her more
               like a lady.

                             tin cup
               after she ran off with that dallas
               banker?

                             romeo
               she did that after you let her
               dump you. it wouldn't kill you
               just once to tell her she's
               beautiful, she can dance, she's

                                                        41.
           sexy.

                         tin cup
           romeo... are you sweet on doreen?

                         romeo
           no more'n you are for that doctor
           lady.

a couple of deep sighs.   two losers with fluttering
hearts.

                         tin cup
           great, romeo, just great... just
           when i need you to be my friend
           and coach, you go get all gooey
           about one of my ex-girlfriends
           who just happens to be our boss.

                         romeo
           anybody comes to me for help on
           their love life about women is
           already too far gone.

                          tin cup
           i don't recall asking you for
           advice.
                   (beat)
           women are tougher to figure out
           than a feathered one iron from a
           tight lie --

suddenly a golf image relaxes them into their comfort
zone.

                         romeo
           actually if you open the club face
           a hair and play it off your back
           foot --

                         tin cup
           shut up, romeo... i wasn't really
           seeking golf tips...

                         romeo
           it's all i'm good for -- but you
           can count on me for that, at
           least.

                         tin cup
           how far off the back foot?

                         romeo
           'bout three balls...

silence.   golf is so much easier than life.

                                                                 42.
                              tin cup
                i'm ready to charge forth in
                pursuit of my mythic destiny and i
                can't get time off work to do it.

                               romeo
                i'm no expert, but it seems to me
                that the `pursuit of a person's
                mythic destiny' is not the sort of
                thing that a person needs to get
                off a five dollar an hour job in
                order to do...

                              tin cup
                i'm stuck. buried. my life's a
                plugged lie in a kakuyi bunker
                with a tight pin position on a
                green with a stimp meter reading
                of thirteen.
                       (beat)
                i need help. i need advice. i
                need counsel...
                       (beat)
                i need a shrink.

                              romeo
                you don't know no shrinks.

                              tin cup
                i know one.

                              romeo
                not the doctor lady?

                              tin cup
                why not?

                              romeo
                you can't ask advice about the
                woman you're trying to hose from
                the woman you're trying to hose!

                              tin cup
                hose?! hose?! get your mouth
                outta the gutter! this is a
                matter of the heart!

      tin cup's caddy pulls up and   he gets out, goes to the
      front of a store that is now   a health services office.
      he looks around warily -- as   if someone might see him
      entering such a place -- and   ducks inside.

                                                                 43.

      it's the exit, "cool down" room, not the waiting room.

      tin cup sits nervously, he's slightly overdressed for
      the occasion. he looks childlike.

      the door to the inner office opens -- a woman comes out
      and sits down across from him. she's weeping
      uncontrollably. he stares. he fidgets. he's nervous,
      out of place.

      finally molly enters through the same door because she
      hears the crying. she sees tin cup -- an awkward moment,
      then --

                              tin cup
                i didn't do anything!

                              molly
                i know... i know... wait in there.

      tin cup slips into the main office while molly consoles
      the weeping woman.
