     the scorer posts an eighty-three next to tin cup's name.

     tin cup stares, shell-shocked, as his score is posted.

               eleven bogeys and seven pars. i
               didn't make a three. i didn't
               make one goddam three all day.

                             romeo
               you weren't trying to make threes.
               you were trying to avoid making
               thirteen.

               i was hungover!

               maybe that was a coaching error on
               my part.
