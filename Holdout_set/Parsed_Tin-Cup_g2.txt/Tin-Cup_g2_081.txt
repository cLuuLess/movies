                i've got some money from the
                pelican bet -- why don't we go
                somewhere fancy and celebrate --
                get ready for the final round.

                              tin cup
                nothing to celebrate yet. plus
                these are my people. i'm a waffle
                house guy -- gotta stay in touch
                with that...

                plus he needs his carbohydrates --

                                                           112.

          if the boys from salome was in
          town -- this is where they'd be...

the boys from salome walk in -- with doreen, all looking
like hell from the long bus trip. they're ecstatic to
see tin cup and romeo.

                          clint

          ex-shrink.
                 (matter-of-factly)
          we're sleeping together now so i
          can't be his therapist.

                          doreen
          i knew it.

                          molly
          knew what?

                        doreen

                ready for the final round?

      but the regulars overwhelm her.

                              dewey
                this is the waffle house, doreen --

                              curt
                hell, i been dreaming of waffles
                for 1800 miles...

                              earl
                they got a waffle house in odessa
                just about like this...

                               jose
                odessa?   it's in midland, ain't it?...

                              clint
                no, it's in odessa.

      they all pull up chairs and settle in for a long evening
      at the waffle house.

      tin cup leans back in his chair, turns to molly.

                              tin cup
                it just don't get much better than
                this...

                              clint/earl
                you the man, cup, you the man...

      romeo leans over to doreen amidst the chaos and speaks
      with suave elegance.

                               romeo
                you're looking particularly lovely
                this evening... the coif is
                extraordinary.

                              doreen
                why thank you... romeo.
