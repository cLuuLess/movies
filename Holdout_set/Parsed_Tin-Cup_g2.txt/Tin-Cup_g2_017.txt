26   int. golden tassel - night                                26

     doreen dances in a yellow rose outfit, a more classic
     strip look than her protegees.


     close on row of dollar bills

     held aloft by the eager locals in the front row... and
     then a handful of papers held aloft by one roy mcavoy,
     also in the front row.

     doreen dances over and picks the papers from his hand,
     reading them as she dances.

               the diehard/west texas calcutta,

               club scramble... what do i want
               with all these entry forms?

          it's a business proposition. i'm
          offering you my winnings from all
          them tournaments this summer.

                        doreen
          in exchange for what?

                        tin cup
          my driving range back.

she dances away from him, not exactly sold on the idea.

she dances back to him, reclines a leg on the partition,
and moves her face opposite his.

                         doreen
          roy, i'm not as dumb as my hair
          makes me look.

                        tin cup
          they ain't all strictly minor
          league. one of 'em pays almost
          two grand!

she twirls off.    he chases her, beer and entries in hand.

          now wait, doreen. you gotta do
          the math, and you gotta look at
          how good i'm playing. i hit the
          shot of the tournament at the
          best-ball. they put it on
          national tv.

                          doreen
          i saw.

                        tin cup
          and what does that tell you?

the music comes to an end.   the club is momentarily
silent.

                        tin cup
                 (shouting)
          and what does that tell you?

                        doreen
          it tells me you took an
          unauthorized day off. next time
          it happens, you're fired. in the
          meantime, i'm putting in a time
          clock.

                        tin cup
          i'm not punching in no time

                                                                 31.
               clock like some working stiff!
