5   ext. driving range - night                                 5

    the lesson begins. tin cup can be slightly condescending
    in these situations, though she's got him a little wary.

                            tin cup
              the first thing you gotta learn
              about this game, doc, is it ain't
              about hitting a little white ball
              into some yonder hole. it's about
              inner demons and self-doubt and
              human frailty and overcoming all
              that crap. so... what kinda
              doctor'd you say you were?

                            molly
              i'm a psychologist -- in layman's
              terms call me a neo-jungian, post-
              modern freudian, holistic
              secularist.

                               tin cup
              damn.

    she begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every
    golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull
    your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from
    your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc.

                            molly
              inner demons and human frailty are
              my life's work. i used to
              practice in el paso but i've moved
              here now...

                               tin cup
              what're those?

                            molly
              i ordered these from the golf
              channel.

                                                           6.

he stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some
of this stuff. he's enchanted and dismayed.

                        tin cup
          that stuff's a waste of money.

                        molly
          i'm sure there are excesses and
          repetitions here, but i believe in
          the gathering of knowledge and i
          figured, well, there must be some
          truths about the golf swing
          illustrated by these devices --
          and that you'd help me sort
          through it.

she stands there with contraptions coming from every
limb.

                        molly
          i have dozens of golf videotapes,
          too... and a golf watch.

                        tin cup
                 (irritated, impatient)
          take it off. all of it. now!
          you're a smart woman, for
          chrissakes -- don't you know the
          work of charlatans when you see
          it?

she deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile.

                        molly
          no. i can always tell when
          someone is lying to himself, but
          i'm quite susceptible and
          frequently wrong when that person
          lies to me.
                 (pointing to the
                  pile of devices)
          that stuff cost me over 200
          dollars --

                        tin cup
          then it's 200 dollars of shit...

he tees a ball, hands molly her driver and steps back.

                         tin cup
          go ahead.   take a swing.

molly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs, and mutters
under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman.

                                                          7.
                        molly
          aw, fuck...

                        tin cup
          well, you talk like a golfer --

molly unloads a mighty second swing. the club head
bounces off the mat. the ball sits untouched.

                        molly
          shit.

                        tin cup
          'fuck...' 'shit...' these are
          highly technical golf terms and
          you're using them on your first
          lesson -- this is promising.

                        molly
          awright, wise ass, show me.

tin cup takes the club from molly, motions for her to
step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the
night.

                        tin cup
          something like that.

he hands her back the club and tees up another ball.
molly just looks at him.

                        molly
          impressive. y'know, i tend to
          process things verbally. can you
          break down into words how you did
          that?

tin cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech.

                        tin cup
          'what is the golf swing?' -- by
          roy mcavoy.
                 (beat)
          the golf swing is a poem.

                        tin cup (cont'd)
          sometimes a love sonnet and
          sometimes a homerian epic -- it is
          organic and of a piece, yet it
          breaks down into elegant stanzas
          and quatrains. the critical
          opening phrase of this song is the
          grip, in which the hands unite to
          form a single unit by the simple
          overlap of the smallest finger...
                 (displays grip)
          ... held lightly, a conductor's

                                         8.
baton.
       (starts swing)
lowly and slowly the clubhead is
pulled back, led into position
not by the hands but the body
which turns away from the target,
shifting to the right side without
shifting balance. tempo is
everything, perfection unobtainable,
as the body coils, now to the top
of the swing, in profound equilibrium.
and then a slight hesitation, a nod
to the gods...

              molly
a nod to the gods?

              tin cup
to the gods, yes... that he is
fallible. as the weight shifts
back to the left pulled now by
powers inside the earth -- it's
alive, this swing, a living
sculpture -- and down through
contact, always down, into terra
firma, striking the ball crisply
-- with character -- a tuning
fork goes off in your heart, your
balls -- such a pure feeling is
the well-struck golf shot -- and
then the follow through to finish,
always on line -- the reverse 'c'
of the golden bear, the steelworker's
power and brawn of carl sandburg's
arnold palmer, the da vinci of
hogan, the unfinished symphony of
roy mcavoy.

                molly
what?    what's unfinished?

              tin cup
i have a short follow through --
my swing can look unfinished.

                molly
why?

              tin cup
some say it's because that's the
best way to play through the winds
of west texas... and some say it's
because i never finish anything.
you can decide. the point is every
finishing position is unique as if
that is the signature left to the
artist, the warrior athlete who,

                                                       9.
          finally and thereby, has asserted
          his oneness with and power over the
          universe by willing a golf ball to
          go where he wants and how and when,
          because that is what the golf swing
          is about...
                 (finally)
          it is about gaining control of
          your life, and letting go at the
          same time.

molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued.

                           molly
          jeez louise...

                        tin cup
          there is only one other acceptable
          theory of how to hit a golf ball.

                        molly
          i'm afraid to ask. what's the
          other theory?

                        tin cup
          grip it and rip it.

                        molly
          while i appreciate your poetic
          sensibility, mr. mcavoy --

                        tin cup
          call me roy, molly...

                        molly
          call me dr. griswold...

                        molly (cont'd)
          roy... but at this point i think
          i'm more of the 'grip it and rip
          it' school. hand me the driver.

tin cup does.   she tees it up.

                         tin cup
          waggle it, doc, don't forget to
          waggle.
                  (as she stares at
                   him)
          waggle... the club head...
                  (shows her)
          ... it's a little relaxing
          ritual...

she waggles the club head, then takes the club back.

                                                             10.
                        tin cup
          let the big dog eat!

she stops, lets the club fall.

                          molly
          what big dog?

                        tin cup
          the driver, the number one wood --

                          molly
          it's metal.

                        tin cup
          yeah, woods are metal -- don't
          worry about it -- and the driver's
          known as the big dog and i'm just
          saying to turn him loose, let 'er
          rip, let the big dog eat!

                          molly
          oh.

she swings.   tops the ball.   it goes ten feet.

                        molly
          this is, without a doubt, the
          stupidest, silliest, most idiotic
          grotesquery masquerading as a game
          that has ever been invented.

                        tin cup
                 (cheerfully)
          yes, ma'am, that's why i love it.
                 (beat)
          and if you hit one good shot -- if
          that tuning fork rings in your
          loin -- you can't wait to get
          back.

she cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night.   it
felt great and she knows it.

                        molly
          i think the big dog ate something.

                        tin cup
          did the tuning fork ring in your
          loin?

                        molly
          i wouldn't go that far.

                        tin cup
          always quit on a good shot. we'll
          call that lesson number one...

                                                              11.
                 (confidentially)
          ... and if ya wouldn't mind paying
          me in cash -- there's a little
          i.r.s. situation i'm dealing with
          --

                        molly
          if you're such a legendary striker
          of the golf ball as everyone says,
          then why are you, at your age, out
          here in the middle of nowhere
          operating a barely solvent
          establishment, ducking the i.r.s.,
          collecting a few pathetic dollars
          to buy your next sixpack -- when
          you're capable of so much more?

her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor, so
matter of factly that he's disarmed.

                        tin cup
          perhaps i'm chocked full of inner
          demons?

                        molly
          no, you're chocked full of
          bullshit --
                 (cheerily)
          same time next week?

she heads off to the parking lot.    he stares.

                        tin cup
          what did you mean i should try
          'being saddled' sometime?

                        tin cup (cont'd)
          were you being literal or was that
          some kind of freudian type deal?
          molly? doctor?
                 (beat)
          what kind of saddle?


close on molly

as she walks into the west texas night.    she smiles,
enjoying tin cup's confusion.

tin cup just stares into the night, holding his cash, until
jose's voice echoes down from the roof.

                         jose
          i got it!   esta bien!    the flag
          is up!

                                                  cut to:

                                                               12.
