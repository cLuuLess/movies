      tin cup's eyes focus with the look of eagles as he
      addresses the shot.

                              tin cup
                one swing, roy. one good swing.
                dollar bills...

      he swings -- the ball explodes off his club.   tin cup
      holds the pose...

                                tin cup
                we're home...

      suddenly a gust of wind blows, out of nowhere, and tin
      cup's cap blows off, provoking immediate concern.

                              tin cup
                ... little gust there, romes...

      picking up the flight of the ball approaching the green,
      carried it seems by the swelling roar of the gallery.
      the ball clears the water...

      ... and lands at the top of the slope fronting the
      elevated green. it pops up in the air, lands just past
      where it hit, and comes momentarily to rest. the gallery
      roars. and then:

      the ball starts trickling back down the slope, gaining
      speed, moving towards the water, even as the gallery
      screams for it to stop...

                                                                 127.

      ... until finally it disappears into the water with
      scarcely a ripple.


155   back to tin cup                                            155

      he stares first with betrayal, then with anger, and
      looks at romeo, who just shrugs, then at molly.

                              molly
                you can still make par from up
                there --

                              romeo
                she's right, pods, a drop and a
                stroke, up and down par -- we'll
                win it in sudden death.

      but tin cup still has the look of eagles. he's staring
      at the shot he just made, still holding the three wood.

                              tin cup
                i nutted that thing. little gust
                from the gods cost me...

                              romeo
                helluva move you put on that
                sucker, now let's get up there,
                take the drop, and make our par,
                tie peter...

                              tin cup
                i can make this shot.

                              romeo
                not now.

                              tin cup
                now.

      tin cup throws another ball on the ground.

                              tin cup
                i'm playing it from here.

                              molly
                take your drop and make your par!

      tin cup addresses the ball.

                                                    cut to:
