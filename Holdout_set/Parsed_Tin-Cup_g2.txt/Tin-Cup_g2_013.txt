     the announcer from the golf channel looks at the monitor
     where a hand-held camera is picking up stadler motioning
     tin cup over.

                              golf channel announcer
               from two-fifty from a snarly lie,
               over water, on national tv, with
               no warmup... i'd give ten to one
               to a tour pro.

     stadler, mccord, and mickelson are smiling at the bet.


     this is golf. but simms snarls at being challenged.
     stadler drops a ball in the rough for tin cup to hit.

                              stadler
               here ya go.   take a hack at it.

                             simms
               balls versus brains, roy. you
               hit that shot, just keep walking,
               'cuz your ass is fired.

     tin cup mulls over the warning, as:

                               stadler, mccord, mickelson
               come on, roy!    your fans are
               calling!

     stadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery.
     tin cup puts down simms's golf bag.

                             tin cup
               how you gonna fire me in front of
               all these people? especially when
               i knock it on the green.

     and he heads over to where stadler and the others stand
     waiting.

     peter kostis, with a hand mike, following the group,
     begins to describe the extraordinary event unfolding.

                             kostis
                      (on mike)
               it seems like the charity
               tournament is taking a little

                                                               26.
               break for a side bet, here --

     gary mccord moves toward the camera and takes the
     microphone.

                             mccord
               peter, i've done a little
               background here -- this unfolding
               disaster's a driving range pro
               named roy mcavoy, who everyone
               calls tin cup. locals claim he
               he was a pretty good college lick
               and knocked around the mini-tours...

20   tin cup steps up to hit the shot.   mccord lowers his     20
     voice.

                             mccord
               ... but i guarantee you, he's
               about to suffer brain arrest.
               he's thinking about the cameras
               and the gallery and the water, and
               all that gray matter between his
               ears is turning to goo... and
               incidentally, stadler's got it booked
               at ten to one...

     tin cup swings, and:

21   the camera picks up the ball arching high and true off  21
     the club. it lands on the green. the crowd roars... and
     the roar becomes deafening as the ball rolls three feet
     from the pin.

                             kostis and mccord
               he's not that good... he's
               definitely not that good... (etc.)


22   back to the course -- a scuffle's breaking out.           22

     david simms helping some guy over the gallery rope.
     simms walks the guy back to his golf bag... and now tin
     cup understands what's happening, and:

                             simms
               take a hike, roy -- the loop's
               over.

                             tin cup
               you can't fire me. how can you
               fire me? i just knocked it stiff
               from two fifty. gimme that bag.

     tin cup reaches for the bag. the guy holds onto it.
     they wrestle briefly, as simms sighs with fatigue and
     looks for a marshal.

                                                                 27.

                               simms
               security!

     tin cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshals
     approaching. he turns his anger on simms.

                             tin cup
               what about my money?

                             simms
               you just hit the shot that took
               you out of the money. welcome to
               life on the tour.

     tin cup goes after the bag again. the guy still hangs
     on. the marshals arrive, and begin to wrestle with tin
     cup. he goes berserk... a wwf battle royal.

                                                     cut to:
