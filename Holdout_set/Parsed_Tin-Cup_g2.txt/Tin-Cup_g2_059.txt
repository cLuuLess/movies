96   ext. just off eighteenth - day (same time)               96

     live coverage of the simms interview. molly is among a
     small crowd gathered to watch. he doesn't seem to know
     that she's there.

                      (live on mike)
               so tomorrow i'll just go out there
               and try to make some good swings
               and, lord willing, maybe i can put
               up another good number. thank
               you.

                             nantz
               thank you, david simms, a
               brilliant opening round 67 to take
               the lead.

     simms walks away, now off-camera.   fans call out --

                                                                  98.
                                 fans
               david!   david!     over here!

                                 simms
               gotta go.

     simms cuts down behind the tent toward the clubhouse,
     away from the galleries. the marshals open a rope
     allowing him to avoid the crowds, but --

     an elderly couple with a young child are there.   the lady
     has a tiny dog in her arms.

                             old man
               excuse me, mr. simms!
                      (off no response)
               can you sign an autograph for our
               grandson?

                              simms
                      (snaps)
               can't you see i'm busy?! i'm
               working! this is my office! do i
               come to your office and ask you
               for an autograph?! jesus...

     he practically stiff-arms them as he passes, heading up
     to the clubhouse. they stand there in shock.

                             simms
                      (muttering to
                       himself)
               who the fuck these people think
               they are...

     camera pans over to the edge of the tent. molly, trying
     to get to david, has seen the whole thing.


     close on molly

     she speaks to herself.

                             molly
               old people, children, and dogs...

                                                   cut to:
