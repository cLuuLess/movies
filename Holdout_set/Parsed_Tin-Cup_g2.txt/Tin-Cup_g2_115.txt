      tin cup and simms sign their cards and get up to leave in
      unison. simms turns to tin cup and has to shake his
      head.

                                 simms
                   i gotta hand it to you, roy.   when
                   you go down, you go down in
                   flames.

                                 tin cup
                   someday you can tell your
                   grandchildren you finished second
                   in the u.s. open...
                          (beat)
                   -- just don't tell 'em how.

      and he moves brusquely past simms and out of the tent,
      congratulating tubbs, the winner, as he passes.

                                 tin cup
                   good job, tubbsy... you won it.

      and out of the scorer's tent...
