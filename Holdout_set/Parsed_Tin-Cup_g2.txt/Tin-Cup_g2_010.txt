13    ext. winnebago - day                                      13

      romeo and simms under the awning.   a spiffy new car
      parked nearby.

      david simms, 38, looking every bit like the successful
      tour pro he is... payne stewart to tin cup's maynard g.
      krebs.

                              simms
                romeo! it's been awhile.    is
                tin cup around?

      romeo is evasive.

                              romeo
                he's on business in houston... you
                supposed to be out playin' on the
                golf tour.

                                                           19.

                        simms
                 (unfazed)
          well, you tell him i'm in town for
          my big charity best-ball
          tournament, and i got a spot for
          him when he comes back from...
          whatever.

                        romeo
          you got a spot for tin cup?   i
          thought you hated him.

                        simms
          romeo! you wound me. i'm fond
          of the guy, going way back to our
          days at university of houston,
          when we won all those titles
          together.

                        romeo
          he says he carried you on his
          back.

simms won't be drawn into this adolescent competition --
he's too comfortable with himself and his success.

                        simms
          i didn't have much craft back
          then -- just a little native
          ability. roy's a great ball-
          striker....

                          romeo
          why you here?

                        simms
          i want to win my own tournament,
          and he can help me if we can
          manage to behave like grownups
          together. tell him that.

tin cup suddenly appears in the doorway.

                        tin cup
          what's the catch?

                        simms
          there is no catch. i put together
          a tournament with an elite field
          and a half-million dollar purse,
          and i'm tired of seeing all the
          money head out of town.

                        tin cup
          then make more birdies.

                                                            20.
                        simms
          i need you on my team.

                        tin cup
          you ain't that friendly a guy...

                         simms
          we're playing cottonwood where you
          once shot fifty-nine, where you
          can shoot sixty-five in your sleep
          'cuz you know every bump on every
          fairway, every subtle break on
          every green --

                        tin cup
                 (warily)
          you an' me --

                        simms
          me an' you -- like the old days.

tin cup can't quite believe this offer from his old
nemesis but there aren't many options out there. he
grabs simms's hand and starts pumping it, gushing
with enthusiasm.

                        tin cup
          ... well, put 'er there, partner!
          these two homeboys are gonna show
          the world what golf in west texas
          is all about!

                        simms
          no, roy. i didn't mean i want you
          to play with me. i just want you
          to caddie for me, read my putts,
          club me, that kinda stuff.

tin cup wilts like a time-lapsing daisy.   his hand falls
free of simms's. words fail him.

                        romeo
          you son of a bitch.

                        tin cup
                 (to himself, blankly)
          caddie? me?

                        simms
          i can't bring a guy in off the
          street to play in my tournament.
          it's a big-time event, corporate
          sponsors, thirty dollar tickets...
          i got a network to cover --

                        romeo
                 (interrupting,

                                                                   21.
                       outraged)
               this guy off the street, he could
               kick your ass on that golf course.
               like he kicked your ass in junior
               golf. like he kicked your ass in
               college. like --

                             simms
               i'll pay you a hundred for the
               loop, five percent of any
               earnings --

                             romeo
               get the hell outta here! take
               your goddamn color coordinated
               corporate sponsored soul and get
               outta here.

                             simms
               okay, okay, just thought i'd offer
               you some work...

     simms heads to his car.

                                  tin cup
               simms!

                                  simms
                        (stops)
               what?

                             tin cup
               i'll take the job.

                             romeo
               we'll take the job.

     simms nods in agreement, and exits.    tin cup stands there
     with romeo, feeling humiliated.


     pov shot - simms

     drives away down the road.

                             tin cup (o.s.)
               that man stands for everything i
               hate in life.

                             romeo (o.s.)
               you mean like... success?

                                                     cut to:
