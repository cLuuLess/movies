      her face close to tin cup's.    both awake.

                                                                   114.

       molly serves coffee to the regulars.     she's upset.

                                molly
                  which one of you is the bookie?

                 what are the odds that roy will win?

                               earl
                 vegas has him at ten to one. they're
                 sure he's gonna self-destruct.

                               molly
                 those sound good to me -- i want
                 you to place a bet for me. five
                 thousand nine hundred dollars on
                 tin cup to win.

      they stare nervously.

                 that's your nestegg.

                               earl
                 that's a bad idea, honey -- we
                 love him, but he's gonna fuck-
                 up --

                               molly

                 boys --

      silence.   molly's in charge.    she hands them a roll of
      cash.

                               molly
                 put it all on tin cup.

      earl reluctantly takes the money.
