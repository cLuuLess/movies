93    ext. golf course - early morning                             93

      the first tee -- the early morning air is heavy and
      still. the course is quiet and wet with dew. the
      gallery is sparse. the silence is broken by the
      starter's voice.

                              starter (v.o.)
                with the honor in the 7:08
                pairing, from salome, texas,
                mr. roy mcavoy.

      a half-dozen people clap, and --

      tin cup and romeo stagger to the tee, barely making it on
      time. tin cup is massively hung-over and unshaven.

                              tin cup
                no time for a bucket, eh?

                              romeo
                almost missed the starting time
                trying to get you off the floor,
                boss. you don't handle the hooch
                like you used to...

      tin cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurried
      practice swings. the early tee times are strictly for
      the longest of long shots, and almost nobody is around.
      tin cup's hand shakes as he closes the velcro flap on his
      glove. he's wearing the hat and shirt with the sew-on
      patches, as he stares down the first fairway.

      romeo hands him a driver.

                                                                   96.
                             romeo
               i seen this hole on tv. hit the
               big dog down the chute --

                             tin cup
               no, i've learned my lesson. gonna
               play it safe, smart, conservative.
               fairways and greens. hand me the
               two iron.

                               romeo
               you sure?

                             tin cup
               thought of the day is -- `be
               humble.'

     and tin cup launches a two iron down the first fairway.

                                                    dissolve to:
