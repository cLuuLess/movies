      venturi and nantz can barely look at the monitor.

                                                                  130.

                              venturi
                this is the most painful thing
                i've ever watched.

                              mccord (v.o.)
                jim, this is the last ball he has
                in his bag. if he doesn't finish
                the hole with it, he can't turn in
                a card. he'll be disqualified.

      venturi and nantz cover their eyes.

      tin cup unloads another three wood -- another splash.

      he looks at molly.

      close on molly

      she's just laughing.

      romeo tosses down another ball -- tin cup launches
      his fifth attempt to clear the pond. splash.

                              molly
                you're right, roy, what the hell!
                let 'er rip!

                              doreen
                you two are made for each other.

      back to tin cup

      this is still all business to him.    he sets his jaw,
      addresses the shot, and:

                              tin cup
                dollar bills...

      he swings -- another perfect shot... but this time the
      wind relents a knot, and:

165   ball                                                        165

      clears the water, clears the slope, hits the front of the
      green, rolls up toward the pin, and drops in the hole.
      the gallery goes berserk!

      raising his three wood aloft in triumph, he looks over at
      molly and finally cracks a smile.

                                                                   131.

166   continued:                                                   166

      and when she smiles back, he takes his hat off and walks
      to the green, to as great an ovation as the game has ever
      heard.

      venturi and nantz slump, drained, over their monitors.
