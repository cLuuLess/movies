157   ext. eighteenth fairway - day                               157

      tin cup swings again -- the ball sails long and true once
      again, and once again...


158   ... it lands into the hill, bounces once, and trickles      158
      back into the water.

                               venturi (v.o.)
                oh, my.   this is tragic.


159   back to tin cup                                             159

      holding his hand out to romeo, as the gallery murmurs
      uncomfortably.

                gimme another ball.


      back to doreen and molly

      watching behind the ropes.

                              molly
                i can't believe he's doing this.

                              doreen
                       (unfazed)

                              molly
                he can blow the whole tournament!

                              doreen
                it's a miracle he lasted this
                long...

                                                                129.

      waiting at the green, amidst the rest of the gallery
      who's in shock about tin cup's decisions to keep going
      for it, keep trying to prove a point.

                               clint
                 he done blew a gasket, boys...

                 lasted...
