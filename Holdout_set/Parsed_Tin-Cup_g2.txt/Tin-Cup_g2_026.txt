38   ext. pawn shop - day                                        38

     tin cup and romeo emerge, romeo carrying t.c.'s sticks.

                             tin cup
               listen, swami, your job is to
               teach me patience and humility,
               not to advise me on my love life.

                             romeo
               no. my job is to get your head
               straight so you can qualify for
               the open, much less win it. to
               get your head straight you got to
               forget about the doctor lady.

     they head up the street under a collonade toward tin
     cup's waiting caddy.

                             tin cup
               not all my thinking occurs below
               the belt. i actually stand for a
               few things beside where my next
               romantic interlude is coming from.

                             romeo
               then you got no problem telling
               the doctor lady you can't teach
               her no more till after the open.

     tin cup blinks silently a moment, feeling slightly cornered.

                                                              39.
                             tin cup
               that would make an issue of
               something that ain't an issue.
               besides, i'm focused.

     romeo responds with a spanish curse.

                             tin cup
               i mean, this is my quest!

                             romeo
               ahhh... your quest... chingaso...

                             tin cup
               this is where i stand up for all
               the little guys everywhere who've
               had their fill of soulless robots
               like david simms --

                             romeo
               he may be a soulless robot but
               he's a rich, happy soulless robot
               with a beautiful doctor lady
               girlfriend who's got you by the
               huevos --
                      (beat)
               besides, how is getting into the
               u.s. open gonna change what she
               thinks about you?

                             tin cup
               it'll prove to her that i'm not
               who she thinks i am.

                             romeo
               but you are who she thinks you
               are! look, i don't bet on a
               horse with a hard-on.

                             tin cup
               hard-on?! hard-on?! hard-on?!
               here, touch me, feel --
                      (as tin cup grabs
                       himself)
               i don't feel nothing! here!

                             romeo
                      (embarrassed)
               hey, hey... shit... cool it...


39   suddenly a convertible passes -- simms and molly,        39
     laughing, carefree, enjoying each other. the couple in
     the car doesn't see tin cup grabbing his crotch making
     a fool of himself on the sidewalk -- but tin cup and
     romeo see them.

                                                                40.
     the car disappears down the street. tin cup cools off,
     chilled, really -- and full of chagrin.

                             tin cup
               okay, okay... maybe i got a semi.

                                                      cut to:
