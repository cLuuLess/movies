78   ext. driving range - day                                78

     tin cup arrives, fresh from the qualifier.   romeo is
     shafting glubs.

                             tin cup
               romes!  you've come back!
                      (no answer)
               you shoulda been there, romes, i
               drained a 30-foot snake to
               qualify!
                      (off no answer)
               earl gave me a straight read --
               the thing broke half a dozen times
               -- missed ya, pods!

     romeo gives him the silent treatment.

                             tin cup
               okay, don't talk to me -- but
               you're still my guy...
                      (losing patience)
               it's a little late to be pissed
               off! we're in the open! you and
               me!

     still nothing from romeo.

                             tin cup
               awright, be that way --
                      (switches course)
               -- say... has molly been around?

                             romeo
               i knew you had the hots for her.

                             tin cup
               what's this? garbo speaks? of
               course i have the hots for her and
               i'm doing a damn good job of
               keeping things platonic and
               professional till i kick simms'
               ass and show her i ain't who she
               thinks i am because, in fact, i am
               who she thinks i am but if i win
               the open i won't be.

     romeo stares back at that curious logic.

                             romeo
               well, i don't think her nor me nor
               the god of golf his self can keep
               you from blowing up in the open...

                             tin cup
               i made it this far! i just got to
               hold it together for 72 more

                                               76.
           holes!

                         romeo
           there's a lotta triple bogeys out
           there waiting to grab your ass.

                         tin cup
                  (cheerily)
           you're complaining again! romeo's
           back! whining, bitching, pissed
           off -- you're my man!

silence.   some chagrin.

                         romeo
           you didn't fall in love with earl
           to be your caddie?

                         tin cup
           he was a wheezing heart attack
           waiting to happen -- cost me
           three strokes a side...
                  (beat)
           i carried my bag the last four
           holes. i love ol' earl but i need
           you.

                         romeo
           you don't love me?

                         tin cup
                  (exasperated)
           i love you, too, god damn it!

                         romeo
           as much as earl?

                         tin cup
           i don't know! yes, yes, as much
           as earl --
                  (beat)
           more than earl!

                           romeo
           am i special?

                         tin cup
           if you can remove the sexual
           connotations and overlay a golf
           theme, romeo -- i am your juliet.

romeo ponders it all.

                         romeo
           muy bien, julietta. in that case
           -- i am your caddy once again.

                                                                   77.
                             tin cup
               podnuh.

     they shake hands.

                             tin cup
               awright... now that we got that
               bullshit outta the way, i'm gonna
               hit me some balls and start oilin'
               that sweet swing o' mine for the
               big boys...

     romeo sits back in the shade, still washing the thousands
     of golf balls in the rack, watching as --


79   tin cup drops a bucket of balls on the hardscrabble           79
     ground, pulls out a club and limbers up.

                             tin cup
               nobody heard from molly, eh?

                             romeo
               you got it bad, don't ya?

                             tin cup
               somethin' about that chick...

     tin cup addresses the ball and takes a swing.    everything
     looks normal in his swing, but...

     thwock! -- the ball squirls off to the side and rattles
     against a fence. ugly.

                             tin cup
               hmmm... little chili dipper
               there...

                             romeo
               be sure to do that in the open.

     unfazed, tin cup steps up to hit again, but... once
     more --

     thwock! -- another horrible-looking squib to the right.

     romeo stops washing balls and notices, watching tin cup.

     thwock, thwock! -- something's terribly wrong.


     close on tin cup

     concern crosses his face.

                             tin cup
               romeo!

                                                                   78.

                               romeo
               i'm watching.

                             tin cup
               it ain't no chili dipper.

                             romeo
               yeah, boss, you got the 's' word.

                             tin cup
               what am i doing wrong?

                             romeo
               shanks are like a virus -- they
               just show up. nobody can figure
               'em out.

     thwock, thwock, thwock! -- three more chili dippers.   our
     man definitely has the shanks. and he's panicking.

                              tin cup
               romes!   something's terribly
               wrong.   what's your guess?!

                             romeo
               it's the woman.

                             tin cup
               i thought you said it was a virus?

                             romeo
               a woman can have the same effect.

                               tin cup
               what do i do?

                             romeo
               keep swinging...

                                                    dissolve to:
