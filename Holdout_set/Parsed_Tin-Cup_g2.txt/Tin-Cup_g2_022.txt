32   ext. mesquite country club - day                          32

     expensive cars in the parking lot -- a putting green in
     b.g.


     close on truck of mercedes

     the trunk opens. a set of expensive golf clubs is
     removed by a wealthy looking guy, boone, 40's. he
     turns to face tin cup and romeo who is reaching into
     the trunk of roy's cadillac.

                             boone
               let me get this straight -- you're
               going to play me for four hundred
               dollars with those?

     romeo removes an old golf bag from the trunk. it
     contains a rake, a hoe, a baseball bat, and assorted
     garden tools.

                             tin cup
               and i'll give ya two a side... i
               got the title to my car as
               collateral.

                                                                 36.
                             boone
               i'm not interested in that piece
               of shit.

                              tin cup
               that's cuz you think of it as
               transportation, boone. think of
               it as bragging rights. think of
               yourself sitting around the bar
               crowing to your buddies about the
               cadillac you won off tin cup
               mcavoy.
                       (the real kicker)
               they'll forget all about the
               winnebago you lost to me.
