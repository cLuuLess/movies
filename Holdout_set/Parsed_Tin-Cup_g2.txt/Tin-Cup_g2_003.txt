2   ext. driving range - late day                               2

    a man, jose, is on the roof, wrestling with a rickety
    satellite dish, stringing wire, trying to get it to work.
    (we get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he
    struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation.)

    four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of
    yellow into the gathering darkness. roy "tin cup" mcavoy
    stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest
    light, hitting golf balls. thwock...! launching them,
    really, into the deepening night. there's a beer between
    his legs. behind him:

    a group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from tin
    cup. these men are the range regulars: curt, clint,
    earl, and dewey. each man has money in one hand and his
    preferred libation in the other. they're all looking
    back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back
    wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to:

    romeo posar -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of
    the group with a handful of cash. romeo is a part-time
    bookie and full-time driving range man. born across the
    river in mexico, romeo is tin cup's caddie, confidante,
    best friend.

                             romeo
               okay, all bets are down!

    their eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful,
    until... zap! a bug is electrocuted. and dewey cheers
    triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about
    how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet.

                                                                   2.
                             romeo
               number one is the winner! dewey
               has the winner. pays five to two!

     romeo quickly pays dewey and more quickly takes money from
     the losers. it's fast-paced, inane, time-killing
     gambling. tin cup looks over.

                             tin cup
               don't you shitheels ever get
               bored?

     the regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the
     negative as they turn back to romeo and the action at the
     bug lights.

                             tin cup
               ... 'cuz i got a riddle.

     tin cup leads the regulars inside.

     tin cup holds court.

                             tin cup
               takes about two ounces of brains
               to figure it out. anyone think
               they got a brain with two ounces
               of brains in it?

     the regulars silently look at each other, reluctant to
     reveal the heft of their brains.

                             tin cup
               for chrissakes, boys! a little
               self-confidence from the players'
               gallery. we ain't talking long
               division.

                             earl
                      (timidly)
               how much we gotta lose?

                             tin cup
               you want to liven things up, earl?
               that's a hell of an idea. say
               everyone puts in twenty bucks and
               the pot goes to whoever solves the
               riddle.

                             dewey
               you going to get the riddle, tin
               cup?

                                                            3.

                        tin cup
                 (patiently)
          dewey. i'm the one asking the
          riddle. i already know the
          answer. i don't getta guess.
          although... we could say if i get
          to five hundred bounces and no one
          gets the riddle, i get the pot.
          and i know what you're thinking.
          it's an impossible riddle. well,
          it's not. it's an easy riddle.
          and if somehow by the grace of
          fluke luck i win, and you all
          don't agree it was an easy
          riddle, hell, i'll refund your
          money.

                        earl, clint & all
          i'm in... we're in... count us
          in... etc...

                        tin cup
          okay, a man's driving down the
          road with his son and they get
          in a crash. two ambulances come
          and take the man and his son to
          different hospitals. son goes
          into the operating room, the
          doctor looks at him and says, 'i
          can't operate on this boy. he's
          my son.' how's that possible?
                 (beat)
          the clock's ticking boys...

tin cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge.

                        earl
          father didn't sneak back in,
          right? he's still at the other
          hospital?

                        tin cup
          it ain't 'star trek,' earl.   no
          one beamed him aboard.

that eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds.
the men think harder.

                        earl
          well... if the father married the
          son's daughter --

                        tin cup
          it's a family riddle, earl.   think
          clean thoughts.

                                                                   4.
    the regulars puzzle some more.

                            clint
              give us a little hint.

                            molly (o.s.)
              the doctor's a woman.

    all heads turn to take in the arrival of:


3   molly griswold                                             3

    standing just inside the door -- she's a fresh-faced
    beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new
    everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new
    clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks
    like she stepped out of an ad in golf digest. and all
    the men are asking themselves the same question: what's
    she doing here? the silence invites molly to supply the
    riddle's answer.

                            molly
              the doctor is the son's mother.
              feminists pose the riddle to
              reveal how deeply our sexual
              stereotypes run.
                     (directly to tin cup)
              i take it you're a feminist?

    tin cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the
    spell. the regulars wait for tin cup's response.

                            tin cup
              ma'am, i've been called a lot of
              things -- but no one's ever
              saddled me with that one.

                            molly
              you might try being saddled
              sometime -- the smell of leather,
              the sting of a whip...

    the regulars snicker, enjoying her one-upmanship.

                             tin cup
                     (slightly taken
                      aback)
              i'm just a humble golf pro...

                            molly
              you're roy mcavoy the golf pro? i
              pictured something... different.
              i have a seven o'clock lesson.

                            tin cup
              i thought i had a doctor griswold

                                                                   5.
              at seven.

    they hurry out to the range, tin cup oblivious to his
    gaffe.

    and the regulars gather to look out the window --


4   their pov - through window                                 4

    to the range, where molly is stretching and tin cup is
    discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost.
