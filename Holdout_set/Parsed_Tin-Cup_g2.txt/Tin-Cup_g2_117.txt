170    ext. driving range - night                               170

       tin cup and molly are sitting, feet up, a couple lone
       star beers beside them, just taking in the warm texas
       night. her head rests on his shoulder. the world at
       peace.

                               tin cup
                 some people don't like west texas
                 but i think it's the most
                 beautiful place on earth...

                               molly
                 it has its charms...
                        (beat)
                 y'know, by finishing in the top 15
                 at the open you qualified to be in
                 it next year --

                               tin cup
                 damn, i didn't know that...

                               molly
                 i'm thinking with your game you
                 should go back to the qualifying
                 school, try to get out on tour...

                               tin cup
                 then i wouldn't see you...

                               molly
                 actually, i picked up a whole
                 bunch of new clients at the open.
                 lotta guys on the tour said if i
                 could do that much for you,
                 imagine what i could do for
                 them...

                               tin cup
                 there's a lotta head cases out
                 there, you could make a bundle...

                               molly
                 and sleep in the winnebago at
                 night...

                                                             134.
silence.

                         tin cup
           y'know... a man goes through what
           i've gone through, he's supposed
           to learn something.
                  (beat)
           i'm trying to figure out what i
           learned. did i learn anything?

                         molly
           you're learning some discipline and
           self-control...

                         tin cup
           and that there's a time in life to
           play it safe...

                           molly
           that's great,   roy... and i'm learning
           how to listen   to the tuning fork,
           throw caution   to the wind, and take
           crazy risks i   never thought were
           possible...

                         tin cup
           c'mon, molly, when did you ever take
           a crazy risk?

                         molly
           i fell for you...


wide shot - landscape

a desolate driving range outside of salome, texas. bugs,
trucks passing in the night, and a tiny radio sending
george jones across the plains.

                                                 fade out.
