47   ext. cottonwood - first tee - morning                     47

     local qualifier. the first tee of the local open
     qualifier. and the voice of the starter.

                             starter (v.o.)
               ... the next group... roy mcavoy,
               salome, texas... who will be
               playing with...

     the regulars applaud and whistle and shout way too many
     "you the man's!" as tin cup steps onto the first tee,
     followed by his sancho panza, romeo. tin cup is feeling
     on top of the world, at his cocky best.

                             romeo
               how ya feelin', boss?

                             tin cup
               i'm feelin' like par's a bad
               score, podnuh -- fifty-eight's
               within the realm!

                             romeo
               jesus, the doctor lady's here --


     pov shot - molly

     standing not far from the regulars.

                             tin cup
               didn't i tell ya? she's gonna be
               your guru partner. you handle my
               swing mechanics and she handles my
               brain mechanics.

                             romeo
               long as you keep your dick out of
               it --

                             tin cup
               me an' the 'big guy' have an
               understanding. he's gonna lie low
               till i get in the open -- then...
               then...

                             romeo
               the big dog'll eat?

                             tin cup
               the big dog'll hunt, that's for
               sure...

     tin cup steps up to the tee, a couple quick limber

                                                            54.
swings, and he tees it up.   as he does, romeo slips over
to molly.

                        romeo
                 (softly)
          looks like we partners, dr. molly
          --

                        molly
          i just have to help him keep his
          head on straight --

                        romeo
          if you can, you be the first.

                        molly
          he does have the occasional
          tendency towards self-destruction
          it seems.

                         romeo
          it ain't occasional and it ain't
          no tendency -- it's a fact of life
          that he gonna blow sky high, it's
          just a matter of when and how
          fast can the pieces be put back
          together.
                 (beat)
          behind that twinkle in his eyes is
          nitroglycerin.

tin cup waves and motions to his team.

                        tin cup
          quiet in the gallery! a man's
          trying to do his job.

and tin cup uncoils a mighty drive with an elegant
stroke, fully confident and smooth. the gallery
applauds.

                        tin cup
                 (generally
                  announcing)
          got my 'a' game with me today,
          folks... you're in for a real
          treat!

molly leans to romeo just before they all head down the
fairway and confides --

                        molly
          i find him mildly attractive when
          he's obnoxious and arrogant like
          this --

                                                                 55.
                            romeo
               good. 'cause it's his best
               side...

     and they head down the fairway, a scruffy little gallery
     on a so-so course. with a lot at stake...

                                                      cut to:


48   montage of tin cup's front nine                             48

     he hits a perfect wedge -- and says to himself, romeo,
     molly, the gallery, the universe --

                             tin cup
               dollar bills...

49   he nails a two iron straight as a string.                   49

                              tin cup
               nutted it...

50   he rifles another drive into the stratosphere.              50

                              tin cup
               ben hogan?   who's he?

51   putt after putt drains into the jar.                        51

52   close on the scoreboard -- the red numbers (under par)    52
     are going up quickly as every shot he hits is dead, solid
     perfect. minus one, two, four, five, seven...

                                                      cut to:
