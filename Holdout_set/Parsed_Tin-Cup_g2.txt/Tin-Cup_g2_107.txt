      the monitor shows tin cup's drive bounding down the
      middle of the fairway.

                              nantz
                mcavoy's hit a perfect drive, ken.

                i'm not sure that's good news for
                mcavoy. with his inexperience,
                the last thing he needs is an
                excuse to fool with that water
                again today.


150   back to tee                                                 150

      tin cup whispers to romeo as simms tees up.

                              tin cup

                              romeo
                then you got to lay up.

      simms rips a drive down the middle, the ball landing
      a little short of roy's.
