                                                                 110.
      tin cup steps up to his shot.

                              tin cup
                this is for venturi, up there in
                the booth, thinking i should lay
                up...
                       (addressing his ball)
                dollar bills...

      he swings and holds the pose. he caught the ball
      perfectly -- it sails high and true into the luffing
      breeze, the gallery roars, and...

      ... the ball drops, sploosh! into the water, a couple
      feet short of dry land. the gallery groans.`


      back to tin cup

      staring amazed, almost betrayed, that his ball didn't
      carry the water.

                              tin cup
                that's a long fucking ways.
                       (holds out his hand)
                gimme another ball.

                                romeo
                roy...

                                tin cup
                what?

                              romeo
                it's a water hazard. you go up
                there and take a drop. try to
                save par like you did yesterday.

      tin cup's eyes blink with thought as romeo's words get
      through to him.

                                tin cup
                you're right.    what the hell was i
                thinking?

      and he starts down to the water. a thunderous ovation
      greets his approach, and he raises his hat to salute the
      fans saluting him.

                                                       cut to:
