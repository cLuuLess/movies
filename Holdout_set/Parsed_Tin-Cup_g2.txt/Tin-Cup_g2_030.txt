43   ext. driving range - high angle - night                     43

     the lone figure of tin cup stands on a tee, arching seven
     irons -- thwock! -- into the night, serenaded by crickets
     and the occasional bug-light zapping a fly.

     romeo and the regulars stand behind tin cup observing
     approvingly. tin cup mutters something with every swing.
     it sounds like he's saying --

                               tin cup
                        (just before
                         swinging)
                 dollar bills...

     tin cup hits another shot, totally focused.

                               tin cup
                 dollar bills...

                                                             49.
                        romeo
          how'd it go with the doctor lady,
          boss?

                        tin cup
          if she was a par three, i'd'a made
          a nine.

                        romeo
          stroke and distance, eh?

                        tin cup
                 (nods, deep in
                  concentration)
          dollar bills...

romeo backs off to let the man practice, and clint asks:

                        clint
          what's he saying?

                        romeo
          dollar bills. his divots got to
          look like dollar bills. 'course
          moe norman hits divots like bacon
          strips 'cuz he come over the top,
          but that's gettin' too technical
          for you.

clint turns and nods approvingly to the rest of the
regulars.

                        clint
          see that, boys? he's hitting
          dollar bills. tightening his
          game.

they murmur approval, but earl catches clint's eye and
jerks his head at tin cup, indicating clint isn't doing
his job as group spokesman. clint takes a step forward.

                        clint
          uh, something us shitheels want
          you to know, tin cup, is uh, well,
          we been to see doreen, and we told
          her we'd stage a customer's strike
          if she didn't give you time off to
          win the open.

this remark penetrates tin cup's concentration.   he turns
with a smile to the regulars.

                        tin cup
          you perverts did that for me?

                        jose
          we believe in you, man.

                                                                    50.

                             earl
               and if you get past the local
               qualifier, we gonna sponsor you.

     tin cup looks at the beaming faces of the regulars and
     smiles broadly.

                              tin cup
               thanks, boys -- a man couldn't
               have better friends. now move the
               hell back and shut the fuck up.
               you're messing up my
               concentration.

     and with big smiles, they move each other back so as not
     to mess up tin cup's concentration. and he pulls out
     another ball, mutters dollar bills, and hits another
     perfect shot.

                                                     dissolve to:
