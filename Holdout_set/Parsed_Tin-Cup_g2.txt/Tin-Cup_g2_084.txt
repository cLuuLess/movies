125   ext. first tee - high angle - day                          125

      a large gallery surrounds the tree and lines the fairway
      as:

                              starter
                with the honor in the final
                pairing, from salome, texas, mr.
                roy mcavoy.

      boisterous applause.   tin cup tips his cap and nods at

                                                                   117.
      david simms, his pairing in this the final twosome of the
      final round of the u.s. open.

                              tin cup
                fairways and greens, dave... and
                don't forget to wave as i blow by.

                              simms
                you mean blow up? like you always
                do?

      and tin cup moves to the tee.

      his hand shakes worse than it did the first day as he
      tees his ball. stepping back to line up his shot, he
      peers down the fairway through a narrow corridor of
      faces. a daunting sight. he edges over to romeo and
      tautly whispers:

                              tin cup
                do me a favor. bet me a buck i
                don't put it in the fairway.

                              romeo
                i bet you a hundred.

                              tin cup
                okay, good.
                       (going to tee off)
                puts things back in perspective.

                                                     cut to:
