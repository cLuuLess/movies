      venturi and nantz watch tin cup set up to play the shot.

                              venturi
                his adrenalin's gotten the better
                of him, jim. if he lays up he
                takes bogey out of play.

                              venturi (cont'd)
                but if he knocks this ball in the
                water he could make seven or eight.
                and he still has to think about
                making the cut.

                well, every golf fan in america is
                pulling for him.


111   wearing that look, the look of eagles, tin cup addresses 111
      his ball... and he swings -- the ball arches off his
      club, the gallery roars, and...

                                tin cup
                nope.

      ... tin cup drops the three wood on his bag, even as:

                                romeo
                carry, honey!    please!   carry!


      lake

      the ball plunks in the water inches short of dry land.
      the gallery groans.


      back up fairway

      tin cup smiles at molly with chagrin but not defeat.    he
      turns to romeo.

                                                                   108.

                              tin cup
                what the hell. you ride 'er till
                she bucks you or you don't ride at
                all. i can save par from here.

      tin cup hits a wedge to within five feet.

                                 romeo
                up an' down...

                                                         cut to:
