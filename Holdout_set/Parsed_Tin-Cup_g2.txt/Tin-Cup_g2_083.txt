124   ext. putting green - morning                                124

      tin cup hits putts, intense, focused.    peter jacobsen
      works his way over to tin cup.

                               jacobsen
                 looking a little tight, ledge.

                               tin cup
                 musta got too much sleep last
                 night. how you choking?

                                                                 116.
                              jacobsen
                just got one thought in my head.
                ten under. that's my number.

      tin cup looks up, amused by the gamesmanship.

                              tin cup
                no one's ever been ten under for
                the open, not even nicklaus.

                              jacobsen
                that's right, ledge. not even
                nicklaus.

      and he moves off to putt. tin cup drops a couple balls
      on the green to putt, and:

      a ball rolls past them and into a hole.   tin cup looks
      over and sees simms.

                              simms
                sorry, roy, can't believe i didn't
                see you with all that high-priced
                endorsement crap you're flaunting.

                               tin cup
                that's always been your problem,
                dave. you don't think about
                winning; you just want to look
                good.
                       (turns away
                         to putt)
                thing is, this ain't a beauty
                pageant.
                       (turns back, getting
                         in simms' face)
                and it ain't a rain-shortened quad
                cities or a greater greensboro you
                can back into. this is you'n me,
                pal. this is match-play, and this
                time you ain't getting no three
                shots.

                                                      cut to:
