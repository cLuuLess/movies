     -- and there he finds molly, waiting on the tee with her
     driver and a bucket of balls.

                                tin cup
               am i early?

                              molly
               mr. mcavoy, i can appreciate that
               you have a fairly laid-back,
               relaxed lifestyle -- but i have
               hours to keep.

               a former paramour once ascribed my
               fluid sense of time to being born
               under the sign of pisces --
               something about floating through
               the universe --

     he tees a ball for her and steps back.   she's staring at
     him, half-amused.

                             molly
               you amuse me, roy. but i'm the
               only woman in america born after
               world war ii who thinks astrology
               is a crock of shit.
                      (beat)
               now let's see if the big dog'll
               eat.

                                tin cup
               waggle.

                             molly
               i'm waggling...

                              tin cup
               set up to the ball like i showed
               you last time.

mechanical.   tin cup winces.    but she looks terrific.

                        tin cup
          quit trying to wring that club's
          neck, molly. show it a little
          warmth and compassion...

he moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders.

                        tin cup
          remember, this game's about trust
          and touch and letting go. so
          while i'm subtly enhancing your
          technical prospects, why don't you
          tell me all about your personal
          life...

                         molly
          it's none of your fucking
          business, roy.

tin cup's hands move down to square her hips.    he's
discreet and professional.

                        tin cup
          your boyfriend's a golfer --
          that's my bet -- and he's why
          you're taking this game up.
          hell, i probably even know
          him --

                        simms (o.s.)
          get your hands off her ass, roy.

and, as tin cup's hands recoil in alarm...

david simms steps onto the range.

                         molly
                 (to simms)
          hi, sweetie...

                          tin cup
          not him...


close on tin cup

crushed and bewildered.


close on simms

a killer smile. the man is absolutely at ease with his
own success and charm.
