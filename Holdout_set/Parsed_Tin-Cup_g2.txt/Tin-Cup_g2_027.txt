               i cannot give you time off to win
               the open. i don't care if it's
               your 'quest'...
                      (listens)
               ... or your 'destiny'...
                      (listens)
               ... or any of those terms you
               vaguely remember from your cliff
               notes...
                      (listens)

               wouldn't be such a nasty boss.
               g'bye, roy -- i have a business to
               run.
