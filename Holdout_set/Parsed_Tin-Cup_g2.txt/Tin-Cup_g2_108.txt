151   ext. eighteenth fairway - day                               151

      tin cup in the fairway, studying his shot.

                              tin cup
                so birdie wins it.

      he looks at simms, ten yards across the fairway from him.

                              tin cup
                you or me, dave?

      simms points to himself. he has a wood in his hands, but
      he puts the club back and reaches for an iron. tin cup
      edges closer to romeo.

                              tin cup
                       (whispering)
                he's laying up. birdie to tie,
                eagle to win, and that gutless
                wonder's laying up.

                              romeo
                       (whispering)
                par to tie, birdie to win... you
                lay up too, roy. you can make
                birdie laying up.

                                                           125.

they watch simms lay up. then romeo offers tin cup an
iron, hoping he'll take it.

                         tin cup
          you know something, romeo? eagle
          puts me ten under. no one's ever
          finished an open ten under, not
          even nicklaus.

                         romeo
          you don't need an eagle. birdie
          wins, par ties.
                 (firmly)
          hit the lay up. hole a wedge for
          goddamn eagle.

tin cup throws some grass in the air, looks back at the
green, the gallery, the whole grand setting... and he
seeks out molly's face in the crowd. he moves over so
she can hear him.

                        tin cup
          this is everything, ain't it?
          this is the choice it comes down
          to. this is our immortality...

                        romeo
          no time to be thinkin'
          'immortality,' cup... time to be
          thinkin' 7 iron.

molly stands with doreen, hearing tin cup's words.
thrilled and terrified and spellbound, she finds herself
nodding. doreen, on the other is turning ash-white.

                       doreen
          oh no. this is what always
          happens. he's going for it.

                        molly
          go for it!

                        doreen
          no! he just needs par to tie!
          tell him to lay up! he listens to
          you!

                        molly
          go for it, roy! knock it on!

                        doreen
          this is why we split up -- he
          always went for it...

                        molly
          my problem is i've never been with

                                                                 126.
                a man who went for it...

                              doreen
                well, honey, he's your guy.


      back to tin cup

      he selects the three wood.    romeo sighs.
