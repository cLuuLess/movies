105    ext. sixteenth hole - day                                   105

       we hear ben wright's voice as tin cup marks his ball on
       the green. a small gallery has begun to follow him.

                               wright (v.o.)
                 if anyone was ever to make a run
                 at what is the most storied number
                 in open history, miller's sixty-
                 three, it would be today when the
                 rain has softened the greens,
                 enabling the players to take dead
                 aim at the flags. still, the
                 unswerving courage of an unknown
                 driving range pro from salome has
                 raised that humble journeyman from
                 the ashes of an ignominious
                 eighty-three to wave a mighty fist
                 at the pantheon of golf's
                 immortals. this man, this roy
                 mcavoy has laid siege to the
                 record book by birdieing the first
                 seven holes. a brave par from the
                 water at eight, and a glorious
                 birdie three at the daunting
                 twelfth, another at thirteen...

       tin cup gets his read, and steps up to putt.

                               wright (v.o.)
                 ... this putt to go ten under for
                 the day...

       tin cup putts -- when the ball is still two feet from the
       hole, tin cup raises his putter in triumph... and sure
       enough, the ball drops in the hole.

                                                      cut to:
