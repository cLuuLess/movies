	int. big o's

	we track with chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through 
	the crowded roadhouse. the customers are all black, many 
	from the nearby army post, shouting and laughing over the 
	loud music. chet, edgy, is looking for somebody.  he sees...

	chet's pov -- otis

	seen through the crush is otis "big o" payne, a large man in 
	his early 60s, laughing as he stands behind the bar.

	chet

	he nervously puts his hand under his jacket. a gun? he pushes 
	forward to get a better view.

	chet's pov -- otis

	moving in on him. otis looks over, sees the boy, frowns--

	chet

	reaching under his jacket, he pulls out--a photograph. he 
	looks at it--suddenly there is a scream from behind, then 
	gunshots, patrons diving for the floor.

	chet whirls around and we whip pan to see a young man, shadow, 
	emptying his pistol into richie, a young soldier, as a young 
	woman, athena, screams and tries to pull the gun away. with 
	the last shot, shadow turns and heads for the door, but is 
	tackled and swarmed by angry men, shouting.

	we pan to athena, kneeling over the bleeding, twitching body 
	of richie--

	chet

	chet backs up, horrified. a large hand grasps him on the 
	shoulder from behind. he turns to see otis standing over 
	him, strangely calm amid the chaos

				otis
		you weren't in here tonight, were  
		you?

				chet
		no sir.

				otis
			(points)
		go out through the back.

	chet hurries away.  otis watches him for a moment, then turns 
	to the mess in his club.
