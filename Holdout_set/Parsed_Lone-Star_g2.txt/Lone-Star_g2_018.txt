	ext. obstacle course -- morning -- pit

	we shoot up from a pit in the ground. whump! whump! whump! 
	three men leap over, landing on the far side and running 
	away from us.

	men

	del payne runs with cliff and mikey on a pathway along a 
	security fence, the two sergeants struggling to keep up, 
	occasionally vaulting or scaling some mild obstacle.

				mikey
		there's not that much down here, 
		colonel. big o's is the only place 
		in the county that our african 
		american soldiers are uhm--that they 
		feel comfortable in.

				del
		have we had trouble there before?

				cliff
		since i've been stationed here? a 
		fistfight now and then--

				mikey
		we had a kid pass out in the men's 
		room. the town isn't much.

				del
		they didn't come for a vacation.

				cliff
		yes sir.

				mikey
		you know how it is, colonel--first 
		time away from home, dealing with 
		new people--i remember my first hitch--

				del
		substance abuse?

				mikey
		well, yeah, but i went through the 
		program. i haven't had a drink since--

				del
		i meant on the post. in general. how 
		are you dealing with it?

				cliff
		we throw a urine test at them once a 
		month. random numbers, maybe a hundred 
		people at a time

				del
		why don't we make it once a week for 
		a while?

				cliff
		no problem, sir.

	del notices bow hard they are breathing--

				del
		i sprint the last quarter mile. you 
		gentlemen don't have to keep up if 
		you don't care to.

				mikey
		appreciate it, sir.

	del accelerates and we hold with the sergeants, slowing to a 
	near-walk.

				mikey
		guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.

				cliff
			(grins)
		you get the feeling he doesn't want 
		to be here?
