	ext. school -- morning

	pilar sits with amado on the football field bleachers before 
	school starts--

				pilar
		i'm only going to have you for two 
		more years. if you decide not to go 
		on to college--

				amado
		i can't take any more school.

				pilar
		--you're going to be on your own.

				amado
		so?

				pilar
		so i'm worried about you. i don't 
		want you to end up in jail like your 
		friends.

				amado
		they're not going to jail.

				pilar
		don't try to con me, amado. you knew 
		how they got all those things.

				amado
		just some rich anglo out on the lake. 
		don't even live here all year.

				pilar
		that makes it okay?

				amado
		they stole our land--

				pilar
		save your breath. that line doesn't 
		cut it with me.

	a silence. amado sulks.

				pilar
		how do you think you're going to 
		make a living?

				amado
		i can fix cars.

				pilar
		you can fix old cars. mr. washburn 
		told me that the cars they're making 
		now are all computerized--

				amado
		you think i can't learn that?

				pilar
		i think you can learn whatever you 
		want to. i just don't see you doing 
		it. if you want to settle for--

				amado
		i'm not settling for anything. i 
		like cars, it's just not a move up 
		the ladder to you, so you think it's 
		a waste.

				pilar
		that isn't true.

				amado
		oh, come on--you and grandma think 
		anybody who works with their hands 
		is a peasant. when dad--

				pilar
		if you grew up to he anywhere near 
		as good a man as your father was, i 
		would be happy! i would be thrilled.

	they look, at each other for a long moment.

				amado
		it's my life. if i want to fuck it 
		up, that's my business.

				pilar
			(nods)
		i said pretty much the same thing to 
		my mother when i was your age.

				amado
		and what did she do?

				pilar
		two years at hard labor, our lady of 
		perpetual help.

				amado
		catholic school, nasty.

	pilar is nearly in tears.

				pilar
		honey, i think you're smart and you're 
		good and i love you. so don't act 
		like an idiot, all right?
