	int. garage -- kincaid house -- day

	a mess. we start on a campaign poster with sam's face on it 
	and the legend--"one good deeds deserves another--vote sam 
	deeds for county sheriff". we pan to see sam, who has been 
	digging through piles of old junk, set down the box he was 
	looking for--

	closer

	sam pulls out an old holster, a sheaf of real estate and 
	insurance forms, a couple of old paperback zane grey westerns. 
	he pulls out a cracked leather pouch, turns it over--letters 
	fall out. he examines an envelope--no stamp or postmark--
	pulls a letter out, reads--

				sam
		"dearest buddy--"

	he puts the letter down for a moment, thinks. he needs to 
	know. he picks the letter up again, reads.
