	int. high school classroom -- day -- texas map

	we look at a beautiful old pull-down map of texas.

				pilar (o.s.)
		we do the best we can here--

	a teacher in her late 30s, pilar cruz, steps in front of the 
	map and we follow her across the room, carrying a poster

				pilar
		--but hey, public education these 
		days is a bit of a battleground.

	posters hung on the walls beyond her show luminaries from 
	texas history-- sam houston, stephen austin, juan seguin. a 
	new parent, celie payne, stands in the middle of the otherwise 
	empty classroom.

				celie
		he went to school on base when we 
		were in okinawa. it's all--you know--
		kids in the same boat--army brats.

				pilar
		his record shows that he's a good 
		student.

				celie
		i'm more worried about the social 
		thing. are therelike--gangs, or...?

	pilar starts to put the poster up. celie moves to hold it in 
	place for her.

				pilar
		we haven't had any serious violence, 
		if that's what you mean. we've got a 
		pretty lively mix though--you walk 
		into the cafeteria and the anglo 
		kids are in one section, the mexican 
		kids in another and the black kids 
		have a table in the back--thanks--

				celie
		so blacks are--

				pilar
		they're the smallest group except 
		for a couple kickapoo kids. look, 
		you're obviously a concerned parent. 
		chet has no history of getting into 
		trouble--i'm happy to have him in my 
		class.

	she steps back to see if the poster, an old photo of geronimo, 
	looks straight. another teacher, molly sticks her head in 
	the door--

				molly
			(uncomfortable)
		pilar, is uhm--is amado okay?

				pilar
		okay? he's not here?

				molly
		no. is he sick?

				pilar
			(mutters)
		he's going to wish he was dead.
