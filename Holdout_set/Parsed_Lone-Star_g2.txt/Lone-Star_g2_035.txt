	ext. san jacinto street -- day

	sam walks down the main street of town. a crowd is gathering 
	at the other end for the ceremony--

				h.l. (o.s.)
		sheriff!

	we widen as h.l. and jorge catch up to him. h.l. slaps sam 
	on the back--

				h.l.
		historic occasion, isn't it?

				sam
		seems like we have another one every 
		week.

				h.l.
		jorge and his chamber of commerce 
		boys got to keep things hummin'--

				jorge
		we're building up tourism, sam--

				sam
		people come here to catch bass and 
		to get laid at the boy's town in 
		cuidad leon--

				jorge
		sam--

				sam
		you ought to put up a banner--
		"frontera, texas: gateway to cut-
		rate pussy"--

				h.l.
		that kind of talk doesn't help, sam.

				sam
		rather have that than the ten-foot-
		high catfish statue--

				jorge
		i got eddie richter at the sentinel 
		to kill that story.

				sam
		the perdido thing?

				jorge
		he agreed it wasn't exactly news--

				sam
		danny's gonna be out for blood the 
		next time.

				h.l.
		which is why we need to talk to you 
		about the new jail--just so we're 
		all on the same page.

				sam
		we don't need a new jail.

				h.l.
		that's a matter of interpretation--

				sam
		we're already renting cells to the 
		feds for their overflow--

				jorge
		there was a mandate in the last 
		election--

				sam
		it wouldn't happen to be your 
		construction company gonna get the 
		bid on building this thing, would 
		it, h.l. and jorge, you wouldn't be 
		thinking about a couple dozen new 
		jobs to dangle in front of the voters--

				h.l.
		dammit, sam, the people are concerned 
		about crime--

				sam
		we need a drug rehab program, we 
		need a new elementary school--

				jorge
		there isn't money allocated for that. 
		but a jail--

				sam
		look, i'm not gonna campaign against 
		your deal here, but if anybody asks 
		me, i got to tell them the truth. we--
		don't--need--a new jail.

				h.l.
		when we backed you--

				sam
		when you backed me you needed  
		somebody named deeds to bump the  
		other fella out of office.  hey,  
		folks--

	sam and the others smile as they reach the crowd of 
	townspeople, mostly small business owners and retired people. 
	photographers from the paper and a local tv news crew wait 
	by a veiled statue roped off in a little traffic island. 
	mercedes, dressed to kill, stands waiting next to hollis 
	with a huge pair of scissors in her hand.

	cu mercedes

	slowly working the blades of the scissors, she looks coldly 
	at sam--

	cu sam

	he nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him.

				sam
		let's get this thing over with.
