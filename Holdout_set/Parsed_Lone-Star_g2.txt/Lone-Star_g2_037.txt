	ext. san jacinto street -- day

	hollis is finishing his oration, having put the crowd in a 
	good mood.

				hollis
		sometime in the early '70s a reporter 
		from a national magazine was talking 
		to the governor of our lone star 
		state, and he asked him, "governor, 
		what's your ideal of what a real 
		texan ought to be?" governor said, 
		"that's easy, son- you just go down 
		to rio county and get a look at 
		sheriff buddy deeds."

	applause--

	sam

	watching the crowd--

	sam's pov

	we pan with his gaze across smiling faces, till he comes to 
	danny and a couple of chicano friends, looking grim. we rack 
	focus beyond them to see pilar, watching the ceremony from a 
	few yards back--

				hollis (o.s.)
		thank you. we've got one more person 
		to hear from--

	hollis

				hollis
		--and he's somebody who probably 
		knew buddy better than any of us, 
		sam--would you say a few words?

	sam

	not thrilled to be called on. he steps forward reluctantly 
	to applause--

				sam
		you folks who remember my father 
		knew him as sheriff. but at home he 
		was also judge, jury

	he looks to hollis--

				sam
		--and executioner.

	laughter. sam holds hollis's eyes for a moment before 
	continuing--

				sam
		this is a real honor you're doing 
		him today, and if buddy was around 
		i'm sure his hat size would be gettin' 
		bigger every minute.

	pilar

	watching--

				sam (o.s.)
		i used to come to this park to hide 
		from him. now that you're putting 
		his name on it--

	sam

				sam
		i'll have to find someplace new to 
		duck out.

	more laughter--

				sam
		i do appreciate it, and wherever he 
		is, buddy's puttin' the beer on ice 
		for the bunch of you. thank you.

	applause--

	sam steps back and mercedes steps forward with her scissors 
	without looking at him--

				hollis
		and now my fellow council member and 
		one of frontera's most respected 
		businesswomen, mrs. mercedes cruz, 
		will do the honors for us.

	mercedes

	she freezes, smiling, till the still photographers have gotten 
	their shots, then snips the cord to a pulley system that 
	lets the cloth drop--

	statue

	the cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a 
	block of smooth limestone.  a decent likeness of buddy in 
	uniform, his hand on the shoulder of a small chicano-looking 
	boy who stands beside him, eyes raised worshipfully.

	applause from the gathering--

	sam

	watching, a bit removed, as mercedes shakes hands with jorge 
	and h.l. and hollis for the cameras. he overhears a pair of 
	bystanders who are checking out the statue--

				bystander 1 (o.s.)
		it does look like old buddy.

				bystander 2 (o.s.)
		runnin that kid in for loiterin'--

	the bystanders laugh--sam steps away, intercepting mercedes 
	as she steps away--

				sam
		nice to see you, mrs. cruz.

	mercedes just looks at him, keeps going. his gaze brings him 
	to pilar, standing on the sidewalk, watching.

	sam

	steps over from the dispersing crowd--

				sam
		field trip?

				pilar
		lunch hour. my next class isn't till 
		nine-thirty.

				sam
		want to take a walk?
