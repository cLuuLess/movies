	int. auditorium -- night -- cu anglo mother

	an angry woman stands from her auditorium chair--

				anglo mother
		you're just tearin' everything  down!  
		tearin' down our heritage, tearin' 
		down the memory of people that fought 
		and died for this land.

				chicano father (o.s.)
		we fought and died for this land, 
		too!

	we whip pan to see another standing parent--

				chicano father
		we fought the u.s. army, the texas 
		rangers--

				anglo father (o.s.)
		yeah, but you lost, buddy!

	we whip pan to a man in the rear--

				anglo father
		winners get the bragging rights, 
		that's how it goes.

				principal (o.s.)
		people--people--

	wider

	we are in the high school auditorium, a hot-and-heavy teachers-
	and-parents meeting in progress. pilar sits at the end of a 
	long table facing the agitated parents, taking some heat. 
	danny padilla, a young, long-haired reporter, sits in the 
	front taking notes, enjoying the show.

				principal
		i think it would be best not to put 
		things in terms of winners and losers--

				anglo mother
			(points at pilar)
		well, the way she's teachin' it has 
		got everything switched around. i 
		was on the textbook committee, and 
		her version is not--

				principal
		we think of the textbook as kind of 
		a guide, not an absolute--

				anglo mother
		--it is not what we set as the 
		standard! now you people can believe 
		what you want, but when it comes to 
		teaching our children--

				chicano mother
		they're our children, too!

				anglo father
		the men who founded this state have 
		a right to have their story--

				danny
		the men who founded this state broke 
		from mexico because they needed 
		slavery to be legal to make a fortune 
		in the cotton business!

				pilar
		i think that's a bit of an 
		oversimplification--

				anglo father
		are you reporting this meeting or 
		runnin' it, danny?

				danny
		just adding a little historical 
		perspective--

	rear of auditorium

	paloma cruz, pilar's teenage daughter, peeks into the room, 
	then moves down the side toward the stage.

				anglo father
		you may call it history, but i call 
		it propaganda. i'm sure they got 
		their own account of the alamo on 
		the other side, but we're not on the 
		other side, so we're not about to 
		have it taught in our schools!

				pilar
		there's no reason to be so threatened 
		by this--

	pilar is trying to stay calm despite her anger.

				pilar
		i've only been trying to get across 
		some of the complexity of our 
		situation down here--cultures coming 
		together in both negative and positive 
		ways.

				anglo mother (o.s.)
		if you mean like music and food and 
		all, i have no problem with that.

	reverse

	we shoot past pilar toward the parents in their seats. paloma 
	steps up to whisper to her.

				anglo mother
		--but when you start changing who 
		did what to who.

				teacher
		we're not changing anything, we're 
		presenting a more complete picture.

				anglo mother
		and that's what's got to stop!

	pilar looks troubled by what she's heard. she shoots a look 
	toward the others at the table, then slips away with paloma--

				teacher
		there's enough ignorance in the world 
		without us encouraging it in the 
		classroom--

				anglo mother
		now who are you calling ignorant?

				principal
		folks, i know this is a very emotional 
		issue for some of you, but we do 
		have other business to attend to--

				chicano father
		we're not going to get some resolution 
		on this?

	cu principal

	weary--

				principal
		would you people like to form another 
		committee?

	groans from the parents--
