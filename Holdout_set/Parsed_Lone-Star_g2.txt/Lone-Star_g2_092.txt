	ext. mercedes' house -- mercedes

	mercedes is lost in thought as she recalls. she steps into 
	the light by the carport. enrique and nestor are propping 
	anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of mercedes' old 
	station wagon--

				mercedes
		rapidamente! everybody in the world 
		is going to see!

				enrique
		donde vamos? [where are we going?]

				mercedes
		a casa de porfirio zayas. he used to 
		be a doctor on the other side.  
		gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if 
		you can pay he can handle it.

				enrique
		senora, anything it costs, i can 
		work--

				mercedes
		don't worry about it. he owes me 
		some favors.

	enrique turns to anselma still frightened in the rear of the	
	station wagon--

				enrique
		seas tranquila, mija.
			(nods to mercedes)
		estamos en las manos de senora cruz. 
		[just relax, honey. we're in the 
		hands of senora cruz.]

	mercedes starts the car--

				mercedes
		in english, enrique. in english--
