	int. black seminole exhibit -- day -- cu statue

	we start on a statue of a buffalo soldier made from spent 
	bullets and shell casings, then pan to another, then widen 
	to see chet as he pokes his head in, the bell of the door 
	ringing.  he steps in cautiously, looking around the room. 
	on the walls there are photo-blowups, some artifacts, 
	handlettered information on cardboard. chet stops to look up 
	at a picture of a barechested black man with a couple of 
	feathers stuck in his headband

				otis (o.s.)
		that's john horse.

	chet turns to see otis standing back by, the door from the 
	bar--

				otis
		spanish in florida called him juan 
		caballo. john horse.

				chet
			(looks at picture)
		he a black man or an indian?

				otis
			(steps in)
		both.

	otis crosses to the poker table, begins to clean up--

				otis
		he was part of the seminole nation, 
		got pushed down into the everglades  
		in pioneer days. african people who 
		run off from the slaveholders hooked 
		up with them, married up, had 
		children. when the spanish give up 
		florida, the u.s.army come down to 
		move all them indian peoples off to 
		oklahoma--

				chet
		the trail of tears.

				otis
			(smiles)
		they teaching that now?  good. only 
		a couple of 'em held out--this man, 
		john horse, and his friend wild cat, 
		and a fella name of osceola. army 
		put all of them in prison and osceola 
		died, but them other two escaped and 
		put together a fighting band and 
		held out another ten, fifteen years. 
		beat zach taylor and a thousand troops 
		at lake okeechobee.

				chet
		so they stayed in florida?

				otis
		they got tired of fighting, went to 
		the indian territories for a while. 
		but the slave-raiders were on 'em 
		even there, and one night they packed 
		up and nearly the whole band rode 
		down to mexico. crossed at eagle 
		pass.

	they move on to some photos of very african-looking people 
	dressed in beautiful seminole clothing--

				otis
		men worked for santa anna down there, 
		waited out the civil war. the land 
		wasn't much to feed people on, so in 
		1870 they come north and put up at 
		fort duncan and the men joined up 
		what was called the seminole negro 
		indian scouts. best trackers either 
		side of the border. bandits, rustlers, 
		texas rednecks, kiowa, comanche--

				chet
		they fought against the indians?

				otis
		same as they done in mexico.

				chet
		but they were indians themselves.

				otis
		they were in the army. like your 
		father.

				chet
			(surprised)
		you know who i am?

				otis
		i got a pretty good guess.

				chet
		that guy who got shot--

				otis
		you didn't go telling your father 
		you were here?

				chet
		are you kidding? and face a court-
		martial?

				otis
			(smiles)
		he's a pretty tough old man, huh?

				chet
		no sports if i don't keep a b average, 
		no tv on school nights, no pda's--

				otis
		pda?

				chet
		public display of affection. every 
		time he moves up a rank, it's like 
		he's got to tighten the screws a 
		little more--

				otis
		well--

				chet
		i mean, just 'cause he didn't--you 
		know--

				otis
		didn't have a father?

				chet
			(shrugs)
		he's still pissed off about it.

				otis
		when you're his age you'll still be 
		pissed off about him.

	chet nods, looks around--

				chet
		so how come you got into all this?

				otis
		these are our people. there were 
		paynes in florida, oklahoma, piedras 
		negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit--
		congressional medal of honor--

				chet
		so i'm part-indian?

				otis
		by blood you are. but blood only 
		means what you let it.

				chet
		my father says the day you're  born 
		you start from scratch, no breaks 
		and no excuses, and you got to pull 
		yourself up on your own.

				otis
			(sad)
		well, he's living proof of that, 
		son. living proof.
