	cliff stands looking at the arm with sam. mikey is a few 
	yards behind them, playing with his metal detector. beyond 
	him we see the sheriff's car parked.

				sam
		i was driving back from apache wells 
		when they got me on the radio.

				cliff
		this was a rifle range way back when. 
		but we figured it isn't army land 
		anymore, it's your jurisdiction.

				sam
			(nods)
		i've got the forensics fella coming 
		down from the rangers. no way to  
		know how old the body is without 
		some lab work.

				cliff
		that ring--

				sam
		masons been around a long while.

	mikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal 
	detector.

				sam
		treasure hunter?

				cliff
			(apologetic)
		old bullets.  he uhm-- makes art 
		with them.

	sam just nods. mikey frowns, goes down on one knee and 
	scratches something out of the dirt at their feet--

				cliff
		the sheriff says we shouldn't touch 
		anything,

				mikey
			(to sam)
		he can't hear with that rig on-- 
		mikey!

	mikey comes up with something, holds it before them. an 
	encrusted piece of metal--

				mikey
		what've we got here?

	sam takes the thing, lays it back down where mikey found it.

				sam
		s'posed to leave everything right 
		where we found it. they're real 
		particular about that.

				mikey
		the scene of the crime.

				sam
		no telling yet if there's been a 
		crime.

	sam frowns down at the piece of metal as he rubs the face of 
	it.

	cu metal

	sam's thumb wipes across the face of the encrusted metal. it 
	is roughly star-shaped.

				sam (o.s.)
		but this country's seen a good number 
		of disagreements over the years.
