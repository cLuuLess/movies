	int. roadhouse --

	the joint is crowded, people drinking, talking, laughing, a 
	few dancing, all trying to avoid locking eyes with sheriff 
	wade, who sits with his legs stretched out at a table.

	young hollis sits by him, smiling uncomfortably. sax-wailing 
	r&b blasts from the jukebox. young otis, a slick, confident 
	character with straightened hair and a silk shirt on, in his 
	early 20s, stops to talk with a man on his way to bring a 
	tray with a couple beers and glasses over.

				minnie (v.o.)
		--just sit back with his hand on 
		that big ol' gun and act the kingfish 
		with everybody. otis payne had come 
		to work for us by then, and that boy 
		had him some attitude--

	cu wade

	watching young otis with narrowed eyes--

	cu wade's pov -- otis

	a man puts a slip of paper in otis's pocket, pats his back. 
	otis winks to acknowledge the bet, turns, makes eyes at a 
	pretty woman sitting at the bar, who is eyeing him back.  he 
	lays the beers and glasses on the table, starts away.

				wade
		pour it.

	otis turns, cups his hand around his ear-

				wade
		pour it.

	expressionless, he starts to pour the beer into wade's glass. 
	the sheriff looks up into his face--

				wade
		i know you?

				young otis
		name's otis.

				wade
		otis what?

				young otis
		payne.

				wade
		one of cleroe payne's boys?

				young otis
		uh-huh.

				wade
		i sent your daddy to the farm once.

				young otis
		i know that.

				wade
		why you think that was?

	otis feels people watching.  he doesn't want to lose face--

				young otis
		some crop needed pickin' and the man 
		was shorthanded.

	a very insolent answer for the time and place--

				wade
		as i remember it was because he had 
		a sassy mouth on him. must run in 
		the family--you wouldn't be runnin' 
		numbers out of this club, now, would 
		you, son?

				young otis
		runnin' numbers illegal.

				wade
		runnin' numbers without i know about 
		it is both illegal and unhealthy. 
		you remember that.

	the beer is poured. otis starts away--

				wade
		whoah, son. you're not finished. 
		pour his.

				young hollis
		i prefer it in the bottle--

				wade
		shut up, hollis. pour.

	otis meets wade's look now, pours the other beer--

				wade
		how come you don't took familiar?

				young otis
		been away. up to houston.

				wade
		houston, huh? i hear they let you 
		boys run wild up there.

	no response. wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer 
	splashes on the table and drips into hollis's lap--

				wade
		aw--look what you done now. better 
		get something to wipe it up, son.

	half the people in the room are watching now, the other half 
	moving away to relative safety. otis tries to keep a lid on 
	his temper, looks around the room--

				young otis
		you spilt it, you wipe it up.

	wade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at otis nose to nose--

				wade
		i told you to do something. are you 
		gonna hop to it, or are we gonna 
		have a problem?

	otis is starting to shake, but holds his ground--

				wade
		don't want to turn tail in front of 
		your people. i understand.

	he starts to turn away then whap! brings the butt of his 
	pistol up under otis's chin, knocking him to the floor. a 
	woman screams and otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen 
	over, starts to get up--but wade has the pistol levelled at 
	his face--

				wade
		come on, houston, give it a try! 
		come to poppa--

	roderick is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture 
	of peace, as young minnie watches from behind the bar, 
	petrified--

				roderick
		don't mind him, sheriff. boy's just 
		a bit slow, is all. he don't mean 
		nothin' by it--

				wade
		that the problem, son?  you slow?

				roderick
		otis, apologize to the sheriff--

	otis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything--

				roderick
		you got him too scared to peep, 
		sheriff. maybe if you put that gun 
		up--

				wade
		you telling me what to do, roderick?

				roderick
		no, sheriff, i'm just--

	wade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise--

				wade
		what's this i see? is that whiskey 
		in them glasses on the bar? roderick, 
		i'm gonna have to cite you for a 
		violation of state law--

				roderick
		this is a club, sheriff--you been in 
		here--

				wade
		and people better clear out of here! 
		now!

	a few people start for the exit.  wade swivels and blam sends 
	a bullet past minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind 
	the bar.  people run for the door. wade squats down to look 
	otis in the face--

	cu wade

				wade
		you learn how to act your place, 
		son. this idn't houston.

	he stands and we follow him toward the bar--

				otis (v.o.)
		'course i was young and full of beans 
		then--

	the camera passes wade and instead of minnie there stands 
	otis, present day, reminiscing. we are back in '95--

				otis
		i didn't understand the spot i was 
		putting roderick in.

				sam
		and that was the last time you saw 
		him?

	we shift to see sam sitting where wade was headed--

				otis
		oh--i think he came in one more time 
		with hollis and--naw, your daddy 
		wasn't with them. made their monthly 
		pickup. roderick wasn't in so i just 
		kept my mouth good and shut and handed 
		over that envelope.

				sam
		that was the night he disappeared?

				otis
			(shakes his head)
		could of been. that was white people's 
		business.

				sam
		and when my father was sheriff?

				otis
		what about it?

				sam
		what was your deal with him?

	otis smiles, chooses his words carefully--

				otis
		buddy was more a part of the big 
		picture--county political machine,  
		chamber of commerce, zoning board if 
		i kept those people happy, he was 
		pretty much on my side.
			(smiles)
		whenever somebody thought--they start 
		up another bar for the black  folks, 
		they'd be--how should i put this? 
		they'd be officially discouraged.

				sam
		he ever accept cash for a favor?

	otis smiles, looks away to ponder his response--

				otis
		i don't recall a prisoner ever died 
		in your father's custody. i don't 
		recall a man in this town--black, 
		white, mexican--who'd hesitate a 
		minute before they'd call on buddy 
		deeds to solve a problem. more than 
		that i wouldn't like to say.
