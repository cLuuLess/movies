	int. country and western bar -- night

	a crowded room, c&w music plays on the box. sam sits behind 
	a bottle of beer as the bartender, cody, in his early 50s 
	philosophizes.

				cody
		now i'm just as liberal as the next 
		guy--

				sam
		if the next guy's a redneck.

				cody
		--but i gotta say i think there's  
		something to this cold climate  
		business. i mean, you go to the beach-
		what do you do? drink a few beers, 
		wait for a fish to flop up on the 
		sand. can't build no civilization 
		that way. you got a hard winter 
		coming, though, you got to plan ahead, 
		and that gives your cerebral cortex 
		a workout.

				sam
		good deal you were born down here, 
		then.

				cody
		you joke about it, sam, but we are 
		in a state of crisis. the lines of 
		demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run 
		a sucessfull civilization you got to 
		have lines of demarcation between 
		right and wrong, between this one 
		and that one--your daddy understood 
		that. he was like the whatchacallit--
		the referee for this damn menudo we 
		got down here. he understood how 
		most people don't want their sugar 
		and salt in the same jar.

				sam
		you mixed drinks bad as you mix 
		metaphors, you be out of a job.

				cody
		take that pair over in the corner--

	sam swivels to look where cody points--

				cody
		place like this, twenty years ago, 
		buddy woulda been, on them two--

	sam's pov -- corner booth

	cliff and priscilla talk across a table--

				cody (o.s.)
		--warning. not 'cause he had it in 
		for the colored

	sam and cody

				cody
		--but just as a kind of safety tip.

				sam
		yeah. i bet he would.

				cody
		old sam stood for somethin', you 
		know? the day that man died they 
		broke the goddamn mold.

	booth -- cliff and priscilla

	things are obviously more than professional between these 
	two--

				priscilla
		so where does that put us?

				cliff
		well--i don't see what's changed. no -
		pda's, no necking on the obstacle 
		course.

				priscilla
		seriously.

				cliff
		seriously, i think we should get 
		married.

				priscilla
		we been through this before--

				cliff
		we should just do it.

				priscilla
		and if i get a shot at a promotion 
		somewhere--

				cliff
		you could take it--

				priscilla
		it's up or out these days, cliff. 
		say i get transferred to a different 
		post--

				cliff
		i'd quit the army for you, if it 
		came to that.

				priscilla
			(grins)
		man's gonna retire in two years and 
		he offer to quit. big goddamn deal.

				sam (o.s.)
		excuse me--

	they look up to see sam standing over them--

				cliff
		sheriff--hi--this is sergeant--this 
		is priscilla worth.

				sam
		pleased to meet you.

				cliff
		sheriff deeds was in on our 
		archeological find yesterday.

				priscilla
		it true they gonna build a shopping 
		mall out there?

				sam
		if certain people have their way, 
		it's going to be a new jail.

				priscilla
		damn. maybe we got in the wrong 
		business. they closin' down military 
		bases left and right, puttin' up 
		jails like 7-11 stores.

				sam
		do either of you have any idea when 
		they stopped using that site as a 
		rifle range?

				cliff
		they stopped training infantry there 
		in the late '50s. it was just a 
		playground for the jackrabbits till 
		they gave it to the county last year.

				priscilla
		you know who it was they dug up?

				sam
		not for sure yet. but i kind of wish 
		they hadn't.
