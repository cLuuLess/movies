	int. roadhouse

	late-50s r&b plays on the jukebox. otis stands behind the 
	counter hooking the beer taps up. del steps in and sits on a 
	stool at the far end of the bar, tense, looking around the 
	place. when otis sees him, he stops dead. they lock eyes for 
	a moment, then otis turns to call.

				otis
		carolyn--knock that off for a minute.

	carolyn

	carolyn sykes, an attractive woman maybe ten years younger 
	than otis, pulls the plug from the jukebox near where she's 
	scrubbing bloodstains off the floor. she turns to look at 
	the newcomer--

	bar

	del doesn't move to come closer--

				del
		black seminoles?

				otis
			(shrugs)
		hobby of mine. got some artifacts, 
		couple pieces one of your men out at 
		the base made. free admission.

	del nods toward where carolyn is mopping--

				del
		that where he was shot?

				otis
		that's where he fell.

				del
		you get much of that in here?

				otis
		it's a bar. people come together, 
		drink, fall in love, fall out of 
		love, air their grudges out--

				del
		deal drugs in the bathroom--

				otis
		if i thought it would help i'd put 
		up a sign telling them not to. right 
		under the one about the employees 
		washing their hands.

	carolyn has come over by otis, lugging the bucket and mop--

				otis
		this here's carolyn. honey, this is 
		my son, delmore.

				del
		nice to meet you, ma'am.

	carolyn nods, shoots a look to otis--

				carolyn
		i'll be in back waiting for that 
		delivery.

	they wail till she is gone to start again--

				otis
		so.

				del
		so tell me why i shouldn't make this 
		place off-limits.

				otis
		this is an official visit, then--

				del
		i assume a lot of your business is 
		from our people.

	otis pulls a tap back and it coughs before squirting beer.

				otis
		your boys out there cooped up 
		together, need somewhere they can 
		let the steam out. if they're black, 
		there's not but one place in this 
		town they feel welcome. been that 
		way since before you were born.

				del
		we have an enlisted man's club at 
		the post.

				otis
		well, you're the man out there now, 
		aren't you? it's your call.

				del
		that's right.

				otis
			(smiles)
		i been hearing rumors about this new 
		commander coming for a couple weeks 
		now. boys say they heard he's a real 
		hard case. spit-and-polish man. full-
		bird colonel name of payne, they say-- 
		bet you never figured you end up 
		back here.

				del
		the army hands you a command, you go 
		wherever it is.

				otis
		right.

				del
		i hear things, too.  people call  
		you the mayor of darktown.

				otis
			(shrugs)
		over the years, this is the one place 
		that's always been there. i loan a 
		little money out, settle some 
		arguments. got a cot in the back- 
		people get afraid to go home they 
		can spend the night. there's not 
		enough of us to run anything in this 
		town- the white people are mostly 
		out on the lake now and the mexicans 
		hire each other. there's the holiness 
		church and there's big o's place.

				del
		and people make their choice--

				otis
			(smiles)
		a lot of 'em choose both. there's 
		not like a borderline between the 
		good people and the bad people--you're 
		not either on one side or the other--

	del looks away, not wanting to believe this--

				otis
			(softly)
		i gonna meet that family of yours?

				del
		why would you want to do that?

				otis
		because i'm your father.

	del gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between 
	them. he gets up and heads for the door--

				del
		you'll get official notification 
		when i make my decision. he is out 
		the door--otis pulls himself a beer 
		as carolyn steps back out--

				carolyn
		so that's him--

				otis
		yeah--that's him. got two, three 
		thousand people under him out there, 
		you count the civilians.

				carolyn
		that must be a laugh a minute.
