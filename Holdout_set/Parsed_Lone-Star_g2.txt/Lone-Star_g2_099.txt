	ext. drive-in, wide shot -- morning

	we see sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the 
	deserted drive-in lot, staring up at the ruined screen. 
	pilar's car rolls in, parks beside him--

	closer

	pilar gets out, kisses sam, sits by him on the hood--

				pilar
		when's the picture start?

	sam looks at her for a moment--

				sam
		you gonna tell your mother we been 
		seeing each other?

				pilar
		she'll figure it out sooner or later. 
		i don't have to ask permission 
		anymore, if that's what you mean.

				sam
		you have any idea when your father 
		died? eladio?

				pilar
			(shrugs)
		couple months before i was born--

				sam
		try a year and a half. he bands her 
		an old snapshot. pilar looks at it--

	cu photo

	buddy and young mercedes on the lake. buddy with his shirt 
	off on one end of a sailboat, mercedes in a bathing suit, 
	both smiling for the camera--

	sam and pilar

	pilar hands the photo back to him, tries to be calm--

				pilar
		i've never seen my mother in a  
		bathing suit before.  didn't know 
		she owned one.

				sam
		buddy bought the cafe for her with 
		money he took from the county.    
		pilar looks away, struggling not to 
		cry--

				pilar
		they can't pull this on me. it isn't 
		fair--i don't believe this--

				sam
		he paid the hospital bill when you 
		were born. your mom always calls you 
		"our beautiful daughter" in the 
		letters she wrote to him.

				pilar
		from the first time i saw you at 
		school--all those years we were 
		married to other people i always 
		felt like we were connected.

				sam
		i remember thinking you were the one 
		part of my life buddy didn't have a 
		piece of--

	a silence, both of them wondering what the next move should 
	be--

				pilar
		so that's it? you're not going to 
		want to be with me anymore?

	sam knows what he feels but doesn't have the words--

				pilar
		i'm not having any more children. 
		after amado, i had some complications-- 
		i can't get pregnant again, if that's 
		what the rule is about--

				sam
		if i met you for the first time today, 
		i'd still want to be with you.

	it is what pilar needed to hear--

				pilar
		we start from scratch--

				sam
		yeah--

				pilar
		everything that went before, all 
		that stuff, that history--the hell 
		with it, right?

	pilar takes sam's hand, kisses him--

				pilar
		forget the alamo.

	wide shot, drive-in

	sam and pilar sit by each other holding hands, looking at 
	the empty screen--

	music, roll credits
