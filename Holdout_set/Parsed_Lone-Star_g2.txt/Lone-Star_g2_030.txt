	int. cafe -- night -- enrique

	we start on enrique, talking surreptitiously on the pay phone 
	on the way to the kitchen.

				enrique
		sabado por la noche--is, es el  mas 
		seguero--a cruzar por la  manana y 
		pues tendremos que esperar--[friday 
		night--yes, that's the safest--i'll 
		cross in the morning and then we'll 
		have to wait--]

	mercedes bustles by, snapping her fingers--

				mercedes
		off the phone, by we've got people 
		waiting. andale!

	we follow mercedes back into the kitchen, where she moves 
	through, kibbitzing the operation--

	waitress

	mercedes stops by a young girl prepping a pork loin to be 
	cooked. she isn't wearing gloves.

				mercedes
		donde estan sus guantes? tonta! quiere 
		matar a mis clientes? [where are 
		your gloves? stupid! you want to 
		kill my customers?]

	she continues past, shaking her bead, bringing us to pilar, 
	who is trying to stay out of the way--

				mercedes
		these ones coming up are getting 
		stupider every year.

				pilar
		maybe you're just getting less 
		patient.

				mercedes
		if they're going to survive here, 
		they have to know how to work, elalco! 
		adelante! los clientes esperan!

				pilar
		well, you hire illegals--

				mercedes
			(indignant)
		nobody is illegal in my cafe! they've 
		got green cards, they've got relatives 
		who were born here--if they only had 
		a little common sense i'd be very 
		happy.

				pilar
		if you spent a little more time 
		training them--

				mercedes
		did you come here to tell me how to 
		run my business?

				pilar
		no. i was wondering if you'd like to 
		take a trip down south with us. maybe 
		see where you grew up--

				mercedes
		why would i want to go there?

				pilar
		oh, come on--you must be curious how 
		it's changed. amado is into this big 
		tejano roots thing and i've never 
		been further than ciudad leon--

				mercedes
		you want to see mexicans, open your 
		eyes and look around you. we're up 
		to our ears in them.

	pilar gives up on the trip. she watches her mother poking at 
	the plates of chips and salsa ready to go out--

				pilar
		mami, how old were you when my father--

				mercedes
		he was killed.

				pilar
		right. when he was killed.

				mercedes
		a little older than paloma is now.

				pilar
		how come you never got married again?

	mercedes just glares at her--

				pilar
		there must have been somebody.

				mercedes
			(mutters)
		i was too busy.

				pilar
		nobody's too busy.

				mercedes
		maybe now. it was different back 
		then. i had this place, i was doing 
		all the shopping, all the cooking. 
		what do i need some chulo with grease 
		under his nails to drink up the 
		profit?

				pilar
			(pissed off)
		thank you.

				mercedes
		i don't mean fernando.

				pilar
		mami, the first time i brought him 
		home, those were your exact words-- 
		"some chulo with grease under his 
		nails."

				mercedes
		i never said that.

				pilar
		you made it pretty damn clear you 
		thought he was nobody.

				mercedes
		i felt that you could do better for 
		yourself--

				pilar
		what? become a nun? you didn't want 
		me going out with anglos--

				mercedes
		i never said that. it was just that 
		boy--

				pilar
		"that boy"--mami, say his name for 
		chrissakes!

	the employees are staring. mercedes won't look at her daughter 
	as she steps out of the kitchen, banging into enrique on his 
	way back in--

				mercedes
		you people are stealing my money-- 
		entiende? robandome?

	mercedes is gone. the young girl, pulling plastic gloves on, 
	looks to pilar.

				girl
		su madre? [your mother?]

				pilar
		si.

	the girl puts her hand on her heart in sympathy--

				girl
		lo siento [my condolences.]
