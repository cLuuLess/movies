	ext. street -- day -- cu vaquero picture

	of a pancho villa-looking vaquero with bandoliers crossing 
	his chest and a gun blazing in each hand. we hear loud music--

	a small group of teenage chicano boys hang around the truck 
	in the bed, on the hood, leaning against it. a boombox placed 
	on top of the cab blasts rancha music out at the neighborhood. 
	somebody's legs are hanging out the open passenger-side door. 
	the kids suddenly look as a sheriff's department car slides 
	into the f.g.  a deputy sheriff, travis, gets out.

	kids

	trying to look tough and unworried as we track across the 
	street toward them. travis's hand reaches out from behind 
	the camera to flick the music off.
