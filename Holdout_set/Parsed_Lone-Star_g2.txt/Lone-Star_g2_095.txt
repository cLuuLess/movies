	int. club

	the door opens. the place is empty now except for otis, 
	standing behind the bar, deep in conversation with hollis, 
	sitting on a stool. both swivel to look around guiltily as 
	they hear sam step in--

	reverse

	sam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to 
	the two men--

				sam
		fellas.

				hollis
		hey, sam.

				sam
		open late.

				otis
		i'm not open. we were just talking.

				sam
		hollis probably told you we found 
		charley wade.

				otis
		yeah. how about that? people start 
		digging holes in this county, there's 
		no telling what'll come up.

	he sits a few stools away from hollis--

				sam
		you two saw it, didn't you? you two 
		saw it when buddy killed him.

	hollis and 0tis look at each other--

				sam
		imonna find out one way or the other.

				hollis
		your father had the finest sense of 
		justice of any man i ever met--

				sam
		yeah, and my mother was a saint. for 
		fifteen years the whole damn town 
		knew he had another woman on the 
		side. stole ten thousand dollars to 
		set her up in business. but hell, 
		what's that? you got a problem?  
		buddy'll fix it. facing some time in 
		jail? buddy'll knock half of it off--
		if you do what he says, when he says. 
		you got some business that's not 
		exactly legal? talk to buddy--

				hollis
		buddy deeds--

				sam
		buddy deeds was a murderer.

	he looks at the two older men for a long moment--

				sam
		that night in the cafe--he didn't 
		stay long after you left, did he, 
		hollis? maybe he decided he'd gone 
		too far with wade, maybe he figured 
		he better not wait for the sheriff 
		to get behind him. so he stepped out 
		to see if he could catch up--and you 
		were here at the club that night, 
		weren't you, o?

	otis sighs, begins to speak softly--

				otis
		i was here.

	cu otis

	he turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we 
	pan away with his gaze--

				otis (o.s.)
		i'd been running a game on the side 
		after hours craps, draw poker on the 
		weekends. roderick didn't know about 
		it. more important, charley wade 
		didn't know about it, 'cause i didn't 
		want to cut him in. i suppose i'd 
		been drinking some, and i was pretty 
		full of myself in those days--but 
		hell, i just didn't expect the man 
		so early--

	sheriff wade and young hollis step in the door and we are 
	back in 1957. blues harmonica fades up, wailing from the 
	jukebox. they stop and look at the place--

	their pov -- club

	music continues. the club is empty, dark. a light shines 
	from the back room.
