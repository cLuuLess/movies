	ext. riverside -- day

	sam and pilar walk together alongside the rio--

				sam
		your mother still doesn't like me.

				pilar
		i can't name anybody she does like 
		these days.

				sam
		i see she built a place up here by 
		the river.

				pilar
		a real palace. she rattles around 
		alone in that thing--

				sam
		she's done well for herself--on her 
		own and all--

				pilar
		so she tells me three times a week.

	she looks at him--

				pilar
		i thought you got through that pretty 
		well.

				sam
		they cooked the whole thing up without 
		asking me.

				pilar
		people liked him.

				sam
		most people did, yeah.

				pilar
		i remember him watching me once. 
		when i was little--before you and i--

	she shrugs.

				pilar
		i was on the playground with all the 
		other kids, but i thought he was 
		only looking at me. i was afraid he 
		was going to arrest me--he had those 
		eyes, you know--

				sam
		yeah.

				pilar
		weird what you remember.

	they walk in silence a moment--

				sam
		your boy, there--

				pilar
		amado.

				sam
		nice-looking kid.

				pilar
		he hates me.

				sam
		no--

				pilar
		with paloma, it's more like she pities 
		and tolerates me- totally age-
		appropriate. but amado--he's--he's 
		never been book-smart. had a hard 
		time learning to read. me being a 
		teacher and caring about those things 
		is like an embarrassment--like a 
		betrayal.

				sam
		fernando did okay, and he dropped 
		out--

				pilar
		fernando wasn't pissed off at 
		everybody. he just wanted to fix 
		their cars.

				sam
		it might just be the age. i spent my 
		first fifteen years trying to be 
		just like buddy and the next fifteen 
		trying to give him a heart attack.

	she looks at him--

				pilar
		so why did you come back here, sam?

				sam
		got divorced, i wasn't gonna work 
		for my father-in-law anymore. the 
		fellas down here said they'd back me--

				pilar
		you don't want to be sheriff.

				sam
		i got to admit it's not what i thought 
		it'd be. back when buddy had it--
		hell, i'm just a jailer. run a 60-
		room hotel with bars on the windows.

				pilar
		it can happen so sudden, can't it? 
		being left out on your own.

				sam
		you've got your mother, your kids--

				pilar
		they've got me. different thing.

	they stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank--

				sam
		remember this?

	pilar looks at the spot. she isn't ready to deal with whatever 
	memory it brings back--

				pilar
		i should get back.

				sam
		pilar--

				pilar
		looks real bad if the teacher's late 
		for class. it's really nice to talk 
		with you, sam.

	she waves and walks away, feeling awkward. sam watches for a 
	minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, he looks at 
	the water.

	river surface

	a little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and 
	drifts away with the current. we tilt up to see young pilar 
	tossing bark into the river as young sam sits on the bank 
	beside her. they are 14 and 15 years old--it is 1972--

				young sam
		you going to tell her?

				young pilar
		you going to tell him?

				young sam
		he doesn't need to know all my 
		business.

				young pilar
		he's gonna find out.

				young sam
		so? what's he gonna do, arrest us?

	young pilar frowns, tosses more bark--

				young pilar
		it's supposed to be some big sin, 
		even if you love each other.

				young sam
		you believe that?

	cu young pilar

	she turns to look at him--

				young pilar
		no.

	we pan with her gaze to see sam, present day, sitting on the 
	bank, lost in thought--

				sam
		me neither.
