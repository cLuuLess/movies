	int. bar

	music continues. we shoot past wade at the counter as otis 
	turns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind--

	cigar box

	music continues. lying open, an old pistol inside of it. 
	young otis reaches--

	cu young hollis

	music continues. frowning as he senses something wrong--

	wade

	music continues. wade levels his gun at young otis's back, 
	then turns to wink at hollis like he did before he shot eladio--

	wade's hand

	music continues. finger closing around the trigger of the 
	.45--

	hollis

	music continues. mouth open in horror--

	wade

	music continues. eyes burning as he aims--

	buddy

	music continues. stepping in the door, seeing, calls out--

	young otis

	music continues. turning to see buddy--

	wade

	blam! thwap! a bullet plows through his neck, knocking him 
	back against the bar.

	music continues. his gun falls from his hand--

	young otis

	horrified, splattered with the sheriff's blood. music 
	continues--

	bar counter

	music continues. twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the 
	envelope and are soaking up blood--

	cu buddy

	calm and hard-eyed. music continues. as he steps forward, we 
	see his pistol is still in its holster. he reaches out and 
	takes the .45 from young hollis's shaking hand, looks him in 
	the eye till hollis looks back, then looks toward young otis--

	we pan with his gaze to a close-up of otis, back in the 
	present. the music fades--

				otis
		sheriff charley had some real big 
		friends in politics then, and if the 
		truth come out it wasn't going to go 
		easy on hollis.
			(he shrugs)
		i don't know why i trusted buddy 
		with it--don't know why he trusted 
		me. the first time i ever talked 
		with him was right there, and then 
		with a dead white man leakin' blood 
		on the floor between us. he could 
		charm the scales off a rattler, buddy 
		deeds.

	wider

	this isn't what sam was expecting. hollis watches his face--

				hollis
		the three of us cleaned up and took 
		him to the post and put him under. 
		can't say i was much help.

				sam
		and the ten thousand?

				hollis
		widow's benefits. he figured it would 
		make the disappearance look better, 
		and that mexican gal was just scrapin' 
		by after charley killed her man. 
		they didn't get hooked up till late--

				otis
		time went on, people liked the story 
		that we told better than anything 
		the truth might have been.

	sam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where 
	charley fell. he has a lot of information to deal with--

				hollis
		what's the call, sam?

	sam rolls it over in his mind before answering--

				sam
		don't think the rangers are likely 
		to find out any more than they  
		already have.

				hollis
		word gets out who that body was, 
		people are gonna think buddy done 
		it.

	sam gets up--

				sam
		buddy's a goddamn legend. he can 
		handle it.

	he heads for the door--

				sam
		'night, fellas.

	hollis and otis watch him go--
