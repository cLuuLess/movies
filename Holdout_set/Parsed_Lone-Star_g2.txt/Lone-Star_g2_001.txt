	ext. texas scrub -- day

	two men in shorts and hawaiian shirts are poking around a 
	sandy section in the middle of scrub flats. sergeant cliff 
	potts is in the f.g., a plant-and-tree guidebook in hand, as 
	sergeant "mikey" hogan works a metal detector over a large, 
	sandy bank in the b.g.  both are army career men with a 
	morning off to pursue their hobbies.

				cliff
		we got ocotillo, devil's walking 
		stick--what's this stuff--it's that 
		whattayoucallit--horse-crippler.

	mikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it 
	in a canvas bag slung on his hip.

				mikey
		this place is a gold mine.

				cliff
		lead mine.

	mikey sees that cliff is talking, pulls his headset off.

				mikey
		what?

				cliff
		it's a lead mine.

				mikey
		right.

				cliff
		i don't know why i'm talking to you, 
		you've got that thing on your head.

				mikey
		you finding lots of cactus and shit?

				cliff
		it's not just cactus.  there's the 
		nopals, the yuccas--

				mikey
			(puts headset on)
		looks like a lot of cactus to me.

				cliff
			(grumbles)
		man knows a hundred-fifty varieties 
		of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia  
		from a prickly pear.

				mikey
			(troubled)

		something about it. explore--

				mikey

	mikey in the f.g. now, looking down at something as he pulls 
	his headset off again--

				mikey
		cliff, you gotta look at this--

	cliff wearily turns and approaches from the b.g.

				cliff
		don't tell me--spanish treasure, 
		right?  pieces of eight from the  
		coronado expedition--

	he stops by mikey and looks down, his expression changing

				cliff
		jesus--

	ground -- cu bones

	sticking out from the sand bank are the skeletal bones of a 
	man's hand.  there is a ring on one finger.
