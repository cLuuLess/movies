	int. apartment -- night

	music still blasting.  enrique steps away from the window, 
	and sits on the bed of his drab furnished apartment. he goes 
	back to tying knots in a length of clothesline splicing it 
	to another. on the bed beside him are new flashlights and 
	the batteries, still in their packaging. he begins to coil 
	the rope--it is hundreds of feet long.
