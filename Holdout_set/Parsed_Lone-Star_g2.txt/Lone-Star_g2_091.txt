	ext. river -- night

	moonlight kicks off the surface of the water.  we hear 
	splashing, the frightened voice of a young woman--

				young mercedes (o.s.)
		donde esta? estoy perdido--[where 
		are you? i'm lost--]

				eladio (o.s., distant)
		aqui! [here!]

	the girl flounders into the shot, wet and scared. young 
	mercedes, a teenager not unlike anselma is wading thigh-deep 
	in the rio, lost, scared--

				young mercedes
		no puedo ver la orilla! [i can't see 
		the bank!]

				eladio (o.s.)
		aqui! venga por aqui! [over here! 
		come this way!]

	mercedes struggles toward the voice and suddenly a young man 
	becomes visible, standing in the water, holding his band out 
	for her, eladio--

				young mercedes
		vi a rosaria arastrado para el  
		corriente--[i saw rosaria taken away 
		by the current--]

				eladio
		no te molestas. tenemos a ella. [don't 
		worry. we've got her.]

	he takes her arm, pulls her toward the far shore--

				eladio
		como se llama? [what's your name?]

				young mercedes
		mercedes gonzales ruiz.

				eladio
