	int. car -- late afternoon

	pilar drives amado and her daughter paloma home--

				amado
		if you had your way i wouldn't have 
		any friends.

				pilar
		oh, come on, amado--

				amado
		just 'cause i'm not like little miss 
		honor roll here--

				pilar
		leave your sister out of it.

				amado
		you and all of the teachers in this 
		dump--your story's over, so you don't 
		want anybody else to have fun.

	we see on pilar's face that he has scored--

				paloma
		you jerk--

				amado
		i'm not talking to you. you don't 
		have any friends.

	pilar eases the car down san jacinto street, seeing something 
	on the street and she's tuning her kids' conversation out--

				paloma
		who'd want to be friends with that 
		bunch of pachuco wannabes?

				amado
		i don't pretend i came over on the 
		mayflower--

				paloma
		and those stupid girls who hang out 
		with them--

				amado
		just shut up.

	pilar's pov -- sam

	sam walks on the sidewalk parallel to them, talking with 
	three other men--

				paloma (o.s.)
		joanie orozco's telling the whole 
		school she's like desperately in 
		love with santo guerra.

				amado (o.s.)
		so?

				paloma (o.s.)
		it's pathetic. you can't be 
		desperately in love when you're 14 
		years old.
