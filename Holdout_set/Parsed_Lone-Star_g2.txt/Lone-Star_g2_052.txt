	ext. llanteria (tire repair shop) -- day

	we watch a kid about amado's age pulling a tire off its rim 
	to put a patch on it--

				chucho (o.s.)
		over here we don't throw everything 
		away like you gringos do.

	chucho and sam

	chucho montoya, in his mid-50s, stands by sam drinking a 
	coke as they watch the kid work.

				chucho
		recycling, right? we invented that. 
		the government doesn't have to tell 
		people to do it.

				sam
		you own this place?

				chucho
		this place, the one across the street, 
		four other ones around ciudad leon-- 
		soy el rey de las llantas. king of 
		the tires. lots of your people rollin' 
		back over that bridge on my rubber.

				sam
			(nods)
		you lived in the states for a while?

				chucho
		fifteen years in el paso.

				sam
		made some money, came back here--

				chucho
		something like that.

				sam
		you ever know a fella named eladio 
		cruz?

	chucho smiles, draws a line in the dirt with his heel--

				chucho
		you the sheriff of rio county, right? 
		un jefe muy respetado. step over 
		this line.

	sam obliges--

				chucho
		ay, que milagro! you're not the 
		sheriff of nothing anymore- just 
		some tejano with a lot of questions 
		i don't have to answer.

	sam smiles, plays with the line with his toe--

				chucho
		bird flying south-you think he sees 
		that line? rattlesnake, javelina--
		whatever you got--halfway across 
		that line they don't start thinking 
		different. so why should a man?

				sam
		your government always been pretty 
		happy to have that line. the 
		question's just been where to draw 
		it

	cu chucho

				chucho
		my government can go fuck itself, 
		and so can yours. i'm talking about 
		people here--men. mi amigo eladio 
		cruz is giving some friends of his a 
		lift in his camion one day--

	we pan from chucho to the flat tire on a battered old pickup 
	truck--

				chucho (v.o.)
		--but because he's on one side of 
		this invisible line and not the other, 
		they got to hide in the back like 
		criminals--

	eladio cruz, young and good-looking, squats into the shot to 
	examine the tire, jack in hand. it is 1956--

				chucho (v.o.)
		and because over there he's just 
		another mex bracero, any man with a 
		badge is his jefe--

	conjunto music comes from the truck radio. young chucho steps 
	past eladio--

				eladio
		donde vas, chucho, tienes que quedar 
		escondido! [shit, chucho you got to 
		stay hidden!]

				young chucho
		voy a romper las rinones si no hago 
		pipi--[i'm gonna bust my kidneys if 
		i don't pee--]

	we track back with young chucho to see we are at the side of 
	a dirt road on the scrubby flatland near the border. eladio's 
	battered pickup truck has wood-slat sides and a canvas top. 
	eladio begins to undo the nuts on the flat tire as young 
	chucho climbs down into a dry creek bed to relieve himself--

				young chucho
		los demas son tan espantados que 
		prefieran mojar sus pantalones. [the 
		other guys are so scared they'd rather 
		wet their pants.]

	chucho tightens as he sees something, ducks down--

				young chucho
		mira, eladio [look!]

	we pan to see the sheriff's car approaching in a cloud of 
	dust--

				eladio
			(calling from where 
			he lies changing the 
			tire)
		muchachos! escondases! [boys! hide 
		yourselves!]
