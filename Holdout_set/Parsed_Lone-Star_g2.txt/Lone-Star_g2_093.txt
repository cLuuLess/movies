	int. del's house -- dining  room

	del steps in. chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in 
	panels. del looks over his shoulder for a moment--

	cartoon

	a tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun 
	blasting away--

				del (o.s.)
		homework?

	del and chet

				chet
		i finished that. i'm just messing 
		around.

				del
		tanks, huh?

				chet
		you got to be in the army, you might 
		as well have something slick to drive.

				del
		so you're going into the army?

	chet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his	
	drawing--

				chet
		that's the general plan, isn't it?

	del watches for a long moment, thinking--

				del
			(softly)
		that's up to you.

	chet looks at his father again. all this is news to him--

				del
		the army isn't for everybody.

	chet can't quite believe he is hearing this. del crosses to 
	the refrigerator--

				del
		not that i don't think you'd be good 
		at it, but--you know--i wouldn't be 
		disappointed if you decided to do 
		something else with your life.

				chet
		you wouldn't?

				del
		no.

	chet nods, begins to play again, considering the 
	possibilities. del is making an effort and he doesn't have 
	much practice--

				del
		how's your room shaping up?

				chet
		fine. i'm pretty much moved in.

				del
		good.

	an awkward silence--

				chet
			(tentative)
		are we going to ever see your father?

				del
		my father.

				chet
		yeah. he lives here, right?

				del
		he does.

	del pulls some food out, watching chet as he draws--

				del
		maybe we'll clean that thing out 
		back up, have a barbecue next weekend. 
		we could invite him and his wife 
		over.

				chet
		cool.

	chet flips the page of his sketchbook--

				chet
		he makes his own sauce.
