	int. jail hallway

	sam walks with amado, who is trying to look defiant--

				sam
		they tell me you're good at fixing 
		things.

	nothin--

				sam
		your father was a hell of a mechanic.

	still nothing--

				sam
		you know, if you figure minimum wage 
		on the time most thieves spend in 
		jail, they could have bought most 
		everything they stole.

				amado
		i didn't steal anything.

				sam
		i didn't say you did. my name is 
		sam, by the way.

	amado just gives him a look--
