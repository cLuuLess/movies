	ext. ruined drive-in -- dusk

	it is dusk, present day. our eyes readjust to see sam, 
	standing by his car in the lot of the long-abandoned drive-
	in. the ruined screen rises in the b.g.

	cu sam

	remembering. music begins as he gets back into the car, pulls 
	away.

	marquee -- dusk

	music continues as the car cruises out past the old marquee, 
	a few letters still jumbled on it, several bullet holes around 
	them.
