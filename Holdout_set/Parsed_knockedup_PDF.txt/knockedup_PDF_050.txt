Òwhat to expect when youÕre 
expecting.Ó 
alison 
what can we expect? 
ben 
well, you canÕt eat sushi. you canÕt 
smoke. you canÕt smoke marijuana. you 
canÕt smoke crack. and you canÕt jump 
on trampolines. this is basically a 
giant list of things you canÕt do. 
alison 
it sounds thrilling. 
ben 
iÕm gonna be sitting there on the 
trampoline smoking crack. and youÕre 
not gonna have anything to do. youÕre 
gonna be bored. but i canÕt wait to 
read these, honestly. i put these in 
front of my toilet, though, theyÕll be 
read by tomorrow morning. do you want 
me to get you that? 
alison 
yeah, thank you. 
ben 
no problem. these are heavy.
