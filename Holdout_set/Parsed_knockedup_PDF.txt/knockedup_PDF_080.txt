int. debbie and pete's house, bedroom - night 
debbie and alison eat ice cream in bed and watch tv. 
alison 
ben proposed to me. he did. it was 
really sweet. i feel a little bad. he 
was wearing this great button-down. he 
tucked it in. he got down on one knee. 
he didnÕt have an actual ring, though, 
just an empty box but he had this 
whole spiel about when he has the 
money, heÕll buy me the ring i 
deserve. 
debbie 
the box was empty? 
alison 
he canÕt afford a ring. 
knocked up - 73.
debbie 
so he got down on one knee and gave 
you an empty box? 
alison 
yes. 
debbie 
iÕm sorry. 
alison 
get over it. if youÕd been there, you 
would have cried. 
debbie 
you need to train him. oprah said that 
when two people meet they should point 
out each otherÕs differences and 
flaws. 
alison 
i thought you should love people for 
who they are. 
debbie 
you criticize them a lot, so they get 
so down on themselves they have to 
change. 
alison 
you donÕt think thatÕs naggy? 
debbie 
in the end, they thank you for it. 
i/e debbieÕs car - day 
debbie drives alison and the girls in her car. 
debbie 
you canÕt commit to him. you donÕt 
even know him. i donÕt even know pete 
after ten years. i donÕt know what 
heÕs up to. heÕs miserable. 
alison 
why do you say that? 
debbie 
i think heÕs cheating on me. heÕs 
always going to business meetings at 
odd hours. then i try to call him on 
his cell phone and he says heÕs in bad 
cell phone reception areas when heÕs 
in good reception areas. 
alison 
maybe heÕs working late. maybe heÕs 
trying to sign a new band. i canÕt 
imagine pete doing that. 
debbie 
thereÕs no part of you that thinks 
maybe heÕs a dirty little scumbag? 
knocked up - 74.
alison 
no. 
debbie 
i think he might be.
