int. geisha house - night 
ben and alison sit at a table in the crowded restaurant. 
ben 
nice place, huh? 
alison 
itÕs really nice. 
ben 
sorry it took so long to get a table. 
i didnÕt realize you needed a 
reservation. 
knocked up - 37.
alison 
thatÕs okay. 
ben 
you look very pretty, though. 
alison 
thanks. yeah, i just thought, i donÕt 
know, i thought maybe itÕd be cool to 
hang out a little bit and... we didnÕt 
really get to talk much last time so i 
thought-- 
ben 
that we didnÕt. 
alison 
i thought maybe weÕd just talk and get 
to know each other...better. 
ben 
cool. okay, iÕll start. iÕm canadian. 
alison 
thatÕs cool. 
ben 
from vancouver. i live here illegally, 
actually. donÕt tell anyone. but it 
works out in my advantage, ultimately, 
Ôcause i donÕt have to pay any taxes. 
so financially thatÕs helpful Ôcause i 
donÕt have a lot of money. iÕm not 
poor or anything but i eat a lot of 
spaghetti. 
alison 
so the web page is it just something 
that you guys do for fun? do you have 
a real job? 
ben 
well, that is our job. 
alison 
oh. 
ben 
we donÕt technically get money for the 
hours we put in, but it is our job. 
alison 
so, how do you...? 
ben 
how do i pay rent and shit? 
alison 
right. 
ben 
when i was in high school, i got ran 
over by a postal truck. 
knocked up - 38.
alison 
oh, my god. 
ben 
it was my foot more than anything. 
but, i got fourteen grand from the 
british columbia government. 
alison 
right. 
ben 
and that really lasted me until now. 
itÕs been almost ten years. i have 
like nine hundred bucks left. so that 
should last me for iÕm not a 
mathematician, but like another two 
years or some shit...i think. 
alison 
yeah. so, i have something i really 
need to tell you. itÕs kind of why i 
called you. here it goes. iÕm 
pregnant. 
ben 
fuck off. 
alison 
what? 
ben 
what? 
alison 
iÕm pregnant...? 
ben 
with emotion? 
alison 
with a baby. youÕre the father. 
ben 
iÕm the father. 
alison 
yes! 
ben 
how the fuck could this happen? 
alison 
i donÕt know. i thought you were 
wearing a condom. 
ben 
no. 
alison 
what? 
ben 
i wasnÕt. 
knocked up - 39.
alison 
why not? 
ben 
because you told me not to. 
alison 
what are you talking about? 
ben 
what am i talking about? you told me 
not to. 
alison 
i did not tell you not to wear a 
condom. 
ben 
hereÕs what happened, okay? i will 
give you a play-by-play of my memory. 
i almost had the condom on my dick. it 
was on the cusp and then you said, 
Òjust do it, already.Ó 
alison 
i didnÕt mean do it without a condom. 
i mean Òdo itÓ like Òhurry up,Ó like 
Òget fucking going!Ó 
ben 
well, i assumed you were wearing a 
patch, or like a dental dam or one of 
those fuckinÕ butterfly clips or 
something like that. 
alison 
what the hell is a dental dam? 
ben 
itÕs like saran wrap! itÕs disgusting, 
okay? but i thought you had one. why 
the fuck didnÕt you stop me once we 
started? 
alison 
oh, my god! i donÕt know! i couldnÕt 
tell that you didnÕt have one on! 
obviously, i was drunk! 
ben 
was your vagina drunk? did you think 
itÕs the thinnest condom on earth i 
have on? iÕm a fuckinÕ inventor? i 
made a dick-skin condom? he hollowed 
out a penis and put it on? what the 
fuck?! 
alison 
you are unbelievable. 
ben 
okay, you know what? maybe, iÕve 
reacted unfavorably. so what happens 
now? i donÕt know how this works. 
knocked up - 40.
alison 
i am going to the doctor next 
week...and i thought you could come 
with me to the gynecologist. 
ben 
so you havenÕt seen him, though? 
alison 
no. 
ben 
so you donÕt know if youÕre pregnant. 
alison 
well, iÕm not a hundred percent sure. 
ben 
youÕre not a hundred percent sure. i 
bet youÕre not pregnant.
