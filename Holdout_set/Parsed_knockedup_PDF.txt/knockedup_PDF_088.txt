ext. benÕs house - moments later 
jay, martin, alison, jodi, jonah, jason and ben stand on the 
street. jason is naked. jonahÕs girlfriend alex is also naked. 
jay 
that was horrible! that was so 
horrible. 
jason 
youÕre fine, man. 
jay 
when will it be light out? 
jason 
take it easy. 
jay 
when will it be light out? 
jason 
did anybody turn off the gas? 
martin 
i didnÕt do it. 
knocked up - 81.
jason 
oh, motherfucker. 
jason runs back to the house. 
jonah 
martin, this is my friend, alex. sheÕs 
a pretty incredible person. 
martin 
nice to meet you. 
martin holds out his hand to shake alexÕs. she removes one hand 
from covering her breast to shake his hand. jonah immediately 
covers her breast with his hand. 
jonah 
whoa, whoa, whoa. dude! not cool, 
martin. 
martin 
thatÕs, that wasnÕt... 
jonah 
hey, are you serious, howard hughes? 
jodi 
what happened? 
martin 
nothing. nothing happened. come on. 
alison 
(to ben) 
where were you? 
ben 
look, i forgot you were sleeping over. 
iÕm sorry okay? 
alison 
yeah, because you were getting high 
off your huge bong. how am i supposed 
to be comfortable with the idea that 
you can take care of me and the baby 
if you are always getting high? 
ben 
you want me to stop smoking pot 
because thereÕs an earthquake once 
every ten years? that makes no sense, 
alison. youÕre being irrational. just 
relax. weÕre all scared. oh, shit, the 
cops. 
a cop car rolls by. ben throws his bong behind him and it shatters 
on the payment. 
ben (contÕd) 
california. hey! 
knocked up - 82.
