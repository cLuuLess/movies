alison 
yeah. well, she saw one of his e-mails 
and thereÕs an address. ugh. 
ben

alison 
ben, come on. 
ben 
heÕs not cheating on her. 
alison 
how do you know? 
ben 
i just know. 
alison 
are you sure? 
ben 
iÕm one hundred percent sure heÕs not 
cheating. 
alison 
are you really? 
ben 
no. it actually kind of makes sense 
that he would cheat. 
alison 
why? 
ben 
because debbieÕs a pain in the ass and 
peteÕs awesome? 
alison 
well, why donÕt you just come over 
then, and, weÕll just diffuse the 
situation a little?
