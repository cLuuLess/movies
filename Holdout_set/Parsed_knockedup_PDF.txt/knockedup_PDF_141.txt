fucking lunatic. i shouldnÕt have said 
that. i feel terrible about it. 
alison

sorry i told you to fuck your bong.

alison

ben 
iÕm going to call him right now.

ben slips into the hallway and calls dr. howard. 
dr. howard (o.s.) 
hello, itÕs dr. howard. iÕm not here 
right now. please leave a message. 
ben 
(into the phone) 
hey, doc howard. ben stone calling.

youÕre at a fucking bar mitzvah in san 
francisco, you motherfucking piece of 
shit! and you know iÕm going to have

your ass. youÕre dead! youÕre tupac! 
you are fucking biggie, you piece of

ben goes back to alison. 
alison 
hey. 
ben 
hey. 
alison 
did you talk to him? 
ben 
i didnÕt talk to him directly, i left 
him a very nice message, though. what 
iÕm about to tell you isnÕt that bad. 
you should know that going in. we can 
get through this and itÕs just a 
little hiccup, but everything will be 
fine. do you trust me when i say 
everything will be fine? 
knocked up - 122.
alison 
i can deal with it. 
ben 
okay. so, dr. howard is at a bar 
mitzvah. 
alison 
a bar mitzvah? 
ben 
itÕs a jewish rite of passage. and 
heÕs going to be there for the next 
three days, so he will not be able to 
be here tonight. 
alison 
itÕs okay. what do you think we should 
do? 
ben 
i know exactly what to do. all we do 
is weÕll get in the car, iÕll drive to 
the hospital, and on the way, we will 
call every gynecologist weÕve met. 
someone will be available. you know? 
alison 
i can do that. 
ben 
good. we still have time. i mean, how 
far apart are your contractions? 
alison 
i think, like, seven minutes. 
ben 
seven minutes! see? not until four 
minutes is it really coming. and has 
your water broken, even? 
alison 
i donÕt know. iÕm in the tub. 
ben 
thatÕs a good point. have you had, 
have you had your bloody show? 
alison 
whatÕs that? 
ben 
itÕs a bloody mucusy discharge. but it 
only comes out right before the babyÕs 
going to come, so if that hasnÕt 
happened, we have time. we can make it 
to the hospital. itÕs no problem. 
alison 
you read the baby books. 
ben 
yeah. i did. i read three of them, 
actually. 
knocked up - 123.
alison 
thank you. 
ben 
youÕre welcome.
