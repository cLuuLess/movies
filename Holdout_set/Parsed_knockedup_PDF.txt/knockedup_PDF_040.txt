int. diner - day 
ben and his father, harris, sit at a table over lunch. 
harris 
iÕm gonna be a grandfather. 
ben 
you happy about that? 
harris 
absolutely. delighted. 
ben 
this is a disaster. 
harris 
no, this is not a disaster. 
ben 
it is, you know? 
harris 
an earthquake is a disaster. your 
grandmother having alzheimerÕs so bad 
she doesnÕt even know who the fuck i 
am, thatÕs a disaster. this is a good 
thing. this is a blessing. 
ben 
i had a vision for how my life would 
go and this definitely is not it. 
harris 
wait. are you living your vision right 
now? 
ben 
i am kinda living my vision, yeah. 
harris 
well, that is sad, iÕm telling you. 
life doesnÕt care about your vision. 
okay? 
ben 
okay. 
harris 
stuff happens. you just got to deal 
with it. roll with it. thatÕs the 
beauty of it all. 
knocked up - 45.
ben 
i just donÕt get how i tell the kid 
not to do drugs when i do drugs. iÕll 
feel like a hypocrite. 
harris 
well you remember what i told you? 
when you were a teenager? 
ben 
what did you say? 
harris 
i said, Òno pill, no powders.Ó 
ben 
thatÕs right, thatÕs right. 
harris 
right. if it grows in the ground, itÕs 
probably okay. 
ben 
i guess it worked. you told me not to 
smoke pot all those years. and then i 
found out you were smoking pot that 
whole time. 
harris 
not the whole time. just in the 
evenings and all day every weekend. 
not that much. 
ben 
honestly, though, when you look at me, 
do you not think at all, like, you 
know, if he just never existed, i 
would have avoided a massive heap of 
trouble? you know? 
harris 
absolutely not. i love you totally and 
completely. youÕre the best thing that 
ever happened to me. 
ben 
iÕm the best thing that ever happened 
to you? 
harris 
yeah. 
ben 
now i just feel bad for you.
