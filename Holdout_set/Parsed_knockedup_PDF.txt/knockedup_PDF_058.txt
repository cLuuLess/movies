ext. playground - day 
ben and pete sit while charlotte and sadie blow bubbles. 
ben 
they seem to love bubbles. 
pete 
they go ape-shit over bubbles. 
ben 
theyÕre really going ape-shit. 
pete 
thatÕs an incredible thing about a 
child. whatÕs so great about bubbles? 
ben 
they float. you can pop them. i mean, 
i get it. i get it. 
pete 
i wish i liked anything as much as my 
kids like bubbles. 
ben 
thatÕs sad. 
pete 
itÕs totally sad. their smiling faces 
just point out your inability to enjoy 
anything. 
ben 
am i going to be okay, man? 
pete 
who knows? is anybody okay? iÕm not 
okay. youÕre asking the wrong guy. 
just donÕt ask me to lend you any 
money, you know? 
ben 
can i just have some? 
pete 
no.
