int. hospital - hallway 
ben and debbie talk in the hallway alone. 
ben 
iÕd like to be in there with 
alison...without you. 
debbie 
okay. i understand how you feel, but 
this isnÕt up to you. 
knocked up - 131.
ben 
look, debbie, you are high off your 
ass if you think youÕre coming into 
that room. if you take one step 
towards that door, i will tell 
security thereÕs a crazy chick in a 
pink dress snatching up babies. okay? 
so donÕt even try to come into that 
room. thatÕs my room now. that little 
area with the pepsi machine...thatÕs 
your area. my room. your area. stay in 
your area. stay out of my room. back 
the fuck off.
