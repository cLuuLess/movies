int. debbie and pete's house, dining room - night 
alison, ben, pete and debbie have dinner. 
pete 
iÕm just saying the music industry is 
different now. steely dan would never 
even have a chance. 
ben 
well, maybe itÕs because steely dan 
gargles my balls. 
pete 
theyÕre incredible. 
knocked up - 84.
ben 
they really arenÕt good, man. 
pete 
old steely dan. 
ben 
if i ever listen to steely dan, i want 
you to slice my head off with an al 
jarreau lp. 
pete 
i should get going. iÕm supposed to 
see this band tonight in hollywood. 
actually, theyÕre playing in laurel 
canyon, so iÕll call you because the 
receptionÕs terrible over there. 
ben 
thatÕs true. 
pete 
and i donÕt want you to worry. iÕm 
just going to jump in the shower. it 
would be terrible if i smelled worse 
than the band. 
debbie 
okay. have fun. 
ben exits. 
ben 
you guys are crazy. heÕs acting 
totally normal and hilarious.
