int. benÕs house - night 
all the roommates and ben sit around passing a bong. 
jonah 
i canÕt fuckinÕ believe you didnÕt 
wear a bag! who does that?! 
jason 
why did we go to costco and buy a 
yearÕs supply of condoms if you 
werenÕt gonna use Ôem, man? 
jonah 
i canÕt believe you did this. you 
fucked everything up. 
jason 
look, the real point is not to get 
yourself in this position. thatÕs what 
you have to realize. you gotta know 
all the tricks. like, for example, if 
a womanÕs on top, she canÕt get 
pregnant. itÕs just gravity. 
jonah 
everyone knows that. 
jason 
what goes up must come down. 
jay 
i think itÕs awesome that youÕre gonna 
have a kid, man. think of it like 
this. itÕs just an excuse to play with 
all your old toys again. 
jonah 
you know what i think you should do? 
take care of it. 
jay 
tell me you donÕt want him to get an 
Òa word.Ó 
jonah 
yes, i do, and i wonÕt say it for 
little baby ears over there, but it 
rhymes with shmish-mortion.Ó iÕm just 
saying -- hold on jay, cover your ears 
-- you should get a Òshmish-morshmionÓ 
are the Òshmish-morshmionÓ clinic. 
jay 
ben, you cannot let these monsters 
have any part of your childÕs life. 
all right? iÕm gonna be there to rear 
your child. 
knocked up - 43.
jason 
you hear that, ben? donÕt let him near 
the kid. he wants to rear your child! 
ben gets up and leaves the room. 
jonah 
aw, ben. ben, come on, man. 
jason 
iÕm just kidding you. 
jay 
oh, great. now heÕs upset. 
jason 
i wonÕt let him do it.
