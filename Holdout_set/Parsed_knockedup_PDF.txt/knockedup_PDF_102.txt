ext. nightclub - night 
debbie and alison approach the nightclub, passing the line, 
straight to the doorman. the doorman lets two pretty girls past 
the rope. 
doorman 
(to the two pretty girls) 
hey, whatÕs up, baby girl? 
debbie and alison move up to the doorman. 
debbie 
hi. 
doorman 
whatÕs up? end of the line, please. 
debbie 
really? 
doorman 
yeah. 
debbie 
oh, come on. 
doorman 
look, weÕre at capacity, okay? weÕll 
let some people in when it clears out 
a little. youÕll get right in if you 
go back to the end of the line. 
knocked up - 99.
debbie 
we come here all the time. itÕs not a 
big deal. it doesnÕt really look that 
crowded in there. 
doorman 
hey, look, i donÕt make the rules. 
debbie 
please? 
doorman 
no. 
two cute girls approach. the doorman lifts the rope for them. 
doorman (contÕd) 
hey, whatÕs up, shorty? whatÕs up 
pretty girls? see yÕall when yÕall get 
out. take care of yourself. 
debbie 
what was that? what the fuck was that? 
doorman 
it is what it is, sweetie. now can you 
step to the back, please? 
alison 
(to debbie) 
you know what? maybe we should just 
go. 
debbie 
you donÕt need to call me sweetie. 
doorman 
yeah, but maybe you should listen to 
your friend. 
debbie 
no, you donÕt need to call me sweetie. 
doorman 
all right, you want to come in, youÕre 
going to have to go to the end of the 
line and wait like everybody else. 
debbie 
iÕm not going to go to the end of the 
fucking line. who the fuck are you? i 
have just as much of a right to be 
here as any of these little skanky 
girls! what, am i not skanky enough 
for you?! you want me to hike up my 
fucking skirt?! what the fuck is your 
problem?! iÕm not going anywhere! 
youÕre just some Ôroided out freak 
with a fucking clipboard. and your 
stupid little fucking rope! you may 
have power now, but youÕre not god. 
youÕre a doorman! okay? youÕre a 
doorman! so...fuck you, you fucking 
fag with your fucking little faggy 
gloves. 
knocked up - 100.
the doorman grabs debbie and takes her aside. 
doorman 
come here, come on. 
the doorman takes debbie aside. 
doorman 
(whispering) 
i know. youÕre right. iÕm so sorry. i 
fucking hate this job. i donÕt want to 
be the one to pass judgement and 
decide who gets in. this shit makes me 
sick to my stomach. i get the runs 
from the stress. itÕs not because 
youÕre not hot. i would love to tap 
that ass. i would tear that ass up. i 
canÕt let you in because youÕre old as 
fuck...for this club, not, you know, 
for the earth. 
debbie 
what? 
doorman 
you old. she pregnant. canÕt have a 
bunch of old, pregnant bitches running 
around. thatÕs crazy. iÕm only allowed 
to let in five percent black people. 
he said that. five percent. that mean 
if thereÕs twenty-five people here, i 
get to let in one-and-a-quarter black 
people. so i got to hope thereÕs a 
black midget in the crowd. 
debbie 
now i feel guilty. iÕm sorry. 
doorman 
why yÕall want to be in here anyway? 
yÕall need to be at a yoga class or 
something. 
(regarding alison) 
what the fuck is she doing at the 
club? thatÕs not even good parenting 
right there. your old ass should know 
better than that. 
debbie 
oh, god. ugh. 
debbie takes alison away.
