int. e entertainment television studio - day 
ryan seacrest stands in front of a series of cameras. alison 
stands behind with a clipboard and headset. 
ryan seacrest 
so if you want that perfect tan like 
the stars, heÕs the one to see. weÕll 
be right back on Òe! news.Ó stay with 
us. 
alison 
(into her headset) 
okay. 
ryan seacrest 
okay, is jessica simpson here yet? 
alison 
let me check. 
ryan seacrest 
is she on her way? 
alison 
hey, guys? 
ryan seacrest 
sheÕs left her house? 
alison 
(into her headset) 
okay, let me know when sheÕs pulling 
in. 
knocked up - 6. 
(more)
(to ryan) 
sheÕs about to pull in. 
ryan seacrest 
is she camera-ready? 
alison 
(into her headset) 
is she camera-ready? 
ryan seacrest 
if sheÕs going to be in hair and 
makeup for three hours. i canÕt do it. 
iÕm not going to be here. i got to do 
Òamerican idol.Ó itÕs live. i got to 
do it. i got to be there. what are we 
going to interview her about? 
alison 
nothing personal. 
ryan seacrest 
no personal questions. 
alison 
no personal questions. donÕt ask her 
about her sister and her nose job. 
ryan seacrest 
no plastic surgery questions. 
alison 
she doesnÕt want to talk about her 
boobs or her fatherÕs comments about 
her boobs. 
ryan seacrest 
great. weÕll talk about the middle 
east and maybe an idea of an exit 
strategy. maybe she has a good pitch. 
should i ask her about korea? maybe 
have her point it out to us on a 
globe? i donÕt understand the young 
talent in this town! it doesnÕt make 
any sense. i got four jobs. hell, iÕm 
more famous than half the people we 
talk to anyway! no one stands up. no 
one has the balls to sit them down and 
say, Òlook, just cut the shit.Óbut 
everybody works for Ôem. theyÕre all 
on the payroll. theyÕre all sucking 
the teat! nobody sits Ôem down, eye-to- 
eye, one-on-one, and says... Òcut the 
shit.Ó and all these stars just to 
fuck it up. thatÕs what they do. they 
fuck my day up! and it pisses me off! 
and now iÕm sweating. 
alison 
you know what? you want us to just 
come and get you when she gets here? 
you want to head to the green room for 
a minute? just chill out? 
ryan seacrest 
thatÕs a good idea. 
knocked up - 7. 
alison (cont'd)
alison 
want us to bring you anything? you 
want some water? 
ryan seacrest 
no. 
alison

ryan seacrest

alison 
okay, weÕll get you a cookie. 
ryan seacrest

office.
