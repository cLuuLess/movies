ext. pelennor fields - day

faramir and a few survivors flee west osgiliath, desperately
riding toward minas tirith . . . in the sky above dark shapes
pursue them ...

angle on: suddenly, from on high, the nazgul strike!

tilt down ... following the nazgul as it swoops out of low-
lying, murky clouds tossing men in the air like limp rag-dolls!

at that moment: across the plain, a figure clothed in white
rides towards them!

from the battlements of minas tirith, a call . . . "the white
rider!"
