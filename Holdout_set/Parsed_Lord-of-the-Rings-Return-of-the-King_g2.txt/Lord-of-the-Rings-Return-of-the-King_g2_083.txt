             and just where do you think you're off to?

aragorn looks at gimli - grateful for his courage but
determined to go alone.

                        aragorn
             not this time ... this time you must stay,
             my friend.

             have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
             of dwarves?

horse - already saddled.

             you might as well accept it - we're going
             with you, laddie.

aragorn shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

angle on: aragorn, legolas and gimli as they slowly ride
towards the back of the plateau . . . past the ancient
standing stones that lead to the narrow pass.
