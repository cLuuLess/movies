                     pippin
          it's so quiet.

gandalf watches the young hobbit.



                     gandalf
          it's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      pippin
          i don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one i can't escape
          is even worse.                                l
               (tense)                                  :
          is there any hope, gandalf - for frodo and
          sam?

gandalf joins pippin as they look towards the distant, jagged
mountains of mordor . . .

                        gandalf
             there never was much hope.

pippin looks up at him, unnerved. gandalf gives him a small
self-deprecating smile . . .

                       gandalf (cont'd)
             just a fool's hope.

gandalf and pippin share a quiet moment as they stare out
towards the fiery sky over mordor . . .

                       gandalf v/0
                  (grim)
             our enemy is almost ready, his full
             strength gathered. not only ores, but men
             as well.

             mercenaries from the coast . . . all will
             answer mordor' s call.

angle on: gandalf . . . he is almost talking to himself now ..
like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.


                       gandalf
             this will be the end of gondor as we know
             it. here the hammerstroke will fall
             hardest.

                       gandalf v/0
             if the river is taken, if the garrison at
             osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
             city will be gone.

close on: pippin ... desperately seeking reassurance.

                       pippin
            but we have the white wizard. that's got to
            count for something.

gandalf looks down at pippin, he says nothing ...

                 (nervous)
            gandalf?

gandalf stares into the distance as if seeing something in
his mind's eye.

            sauron    has yet to reveal his deadliest
            servant    . . . the one who will lead mordor's
            armies    in war, the one they say no living
            man can    kill.

close on: gandalf still staring intently as if facing his
enemy in .person.
