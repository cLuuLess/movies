int. theoden's tent, dunharrow plateau - night

angle on:- theoden looks up as aragorn enters.

                       theoden
             i take my leave.

angle on: theoden bows slightly to the hooded figure and
leaves, shooting aragorn a strange look as he goes ...

close on: the figure stands and pulls back the hood . . . to
reveal ... elrond.

                    aragorn
          my lord, elrond.

                       elrond
             i come on behalf of one whom i love.

elrond's face is etched with pain ...

                    elrond (cont'd)
          arwen is dying.

angle on: aragorn receiving this news ... ashen-faced.

                        aragorn
             she stayed?

                       elrond
             she will not long survive the evil that now
             spreads from mordor.

elrond's eyes fall to the evenstar which hangs around
aragorn's neck . . .

                        elrond (cont'd)
             the light of the evenstar is failing. as
             sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             ring. the shadow is upon us, aragorn, the
             end has come.

                       aragorn
             it will not be our end, but his.

                         elrond
             you ride to war, but not to victory.
             sauron's armies march on minas tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends
             another force which will attack from the
             river . . .

close on: aragorn looks at elrond in shock.

                       elrond (cont'd)
             a fleet of corsair ships sails from the
             south.

flash insert: a fleet of black sails moving along a silver
ribbon of water .

                        elrond (cont'd)
             they will be in the city in two days . . .
             you're out-numbered, aragorn. you need more
             men.

                        aragorn
             there are none.

elrond hesitates a beat ...

                      elrond
                (quietly)
           there are those who dwell in the mountain.

a sudden wind rushes through the tent, lifting hangings,
scattering maps, knocking over goblets . . .

as aragorn looks at elrond, an image flashes in his mind's
eye . . . the ghostly figure on the dimholt road . . .

aragorn looks at elrond in shock . . .

                    aragorn
          murderers, traitors - you would call upon
          them to fight? they believe in nothing.
          they answer to no-one.

                     elrond
          they will answer to the king of condor.

aragorn' s eyes fall to a plain black scabbard, which elrond
draws from beneath his robes.

close on: elrond' s long white fingers draw the hilt of a
sword from the scabbard to reveal . . . a elven sword glints in
the firelight!

                     elrond (cont'd)
          anduril, flame of the west . . . forged from
          the shards of narsil.

aragorn takes the sword . . . staring at it in wonder.

                        aragorn
          sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
          elendil . . .

aragorn draws the long blade from its sheath . . .

                     a rag or n (c on t' d)
          . . . the blade that was broken shall return
          to minas tirith.

                      elrond
            the man who can wield the power of this
            sword can summon to him an army more deadly
            than any that walks this earth.

elrond stares hard at aragorn . . .

                      elrond (cont'd)
            put aside the ranger - become who you were
            born to be - take the dimhplt road.

a heavy silence hangs in the room.

                         elrond (cont'd)
                  (elvish: with subtitles)
            onen i-estel edain.
         /, ,-,                       aragorn
                 (elvish: with subtitles)
            u-chebin estel anim.
            i keep none for myself.

angle on: aragorn re-sheathes the sword.
