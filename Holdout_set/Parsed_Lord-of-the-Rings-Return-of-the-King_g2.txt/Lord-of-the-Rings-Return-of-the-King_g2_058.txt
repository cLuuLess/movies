angle on: iorlas runs towards the gates, yelling . . .

                     iorlas
          open the gates! pull!
                                                      (continued)

the great gates open, allowing gandalf, pippin, faramir and
the osgiliath survivors to ride in . . . nearly 100 wounded and
shocked men.

as gandalf pulls shadowfax up . . .

                        faramir
             mithrandir!

angle on: faramir steers his horse through the crowd towards
gandalf ...

                        faramir   (cont'd)
             they broke through    our defences. they have
             taken the bridge a   nd the west bank.
             battalions of ores    are crossing the river.

                        iorlas
             it is as the lord denethor predicted - long
             has he foreseen this doom!

                        gandalf
             foreseen and done nothing!

faramir suddenly stares at pippin. gandalf reads the surprise
in his eyes.

                       ga nd alf (c on t'd )
             faramir? ... this is not the first halfling
             to have crossed your path ...

faramir shakes his head.

                       faramir
             no.

                        pippin
                  (disbelief)
             you've seen frodo and sam?

faramir nods.

                        gandalf
             where? when?


                                                          (continued)

                      faramir
            in ithilien, not two days ago. gandalf -
            they are taking the road to the morgul
            vale.

                       gandalf
                 (shocked realisation)
            . . . and then the pass of cirith ungol.

close on: gandalf, deeply troubled.

                       pippin
            what does that mean? what's wrong?

                        gandalf
                 (urgent)
            faramir . . . tell me everything.
