     ext. street above - night

     life as usual on delancey street.

     pedestrians crisscross the metal grate, hunched under their
     umbrellas.  traffic noise, t.v. displays on street front
     stores, boom boxes, car horns...

     they drown out the tiny sound of susan's voice...

     susan

     hears distant feet scurrying toward her, punctuated by a
     metallic clang!  clang!  clang!

     side tunnel

     clang!  the metal pipe, still imbedded in the mimic, bangs
     the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel.

     susan

     looks around frantically.  she crosses to a metal lid on the
     floor, lifts it.

     a hole is below, dropping off into darkness.

     the mimic's clanging grows louder.

     susan sits herself on the edge of the hole, grasping the
     metal lid by handles on its underside.

     the mimic rushes into the chamber, speeding toward her...

     susan jumps into the hole, hanging onto the lid...

     whang!  the lid slams shut over the hole a fraction of a
     second before the creature reaches it.

     the mimic touches the lid with its antennae, confused.
