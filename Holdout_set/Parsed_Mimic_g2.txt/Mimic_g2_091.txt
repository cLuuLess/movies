     int. shaft

     susan hauls herself up the framework, handhold by
     handhold. peter is right below her.

     she can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously
     with the effort.

                          susan
                we're gonna make it!

     peter grinds his teeth, trying to make the next
     handhold.

     wham!  something hits the gate below them!
