     int. hospital - icu ward

     susan watches siri from behind a pane of glass.  siri is
     connected to a respirator, her vital signs monitored by
     several machines.

     raymond approaches susan, two cups of coffee in his
     hands.

                          raymond
                how you feeling?

                          susan
                you tell me.

     he smiles, gives her one of the cups.

                          raymond
                your blood tests were all negative.
                you checked out.

     susan visibly relaxes.  she looks back at the icu ward.

                          susan
                what about siri?

                          raymond
                she's stable.  i don't think there's
                any immediate danger, but we'll have
                to keep her under observation...

                          susan
                you think it's some form of
                strickler's, don't you?

     beat.  raymond shrugs.

                          raymond
                pathology's still working on the
                tissue samples.  if it is...it must
                be an errant strain.  shorter
                incubation period.
                     (beat.)
                i'm sorry, sue.  we just don't know
                yet.
