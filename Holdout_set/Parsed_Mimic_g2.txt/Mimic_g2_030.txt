     int. laundry room

     peter comes in to find susan sitting in a chair before a
     dryer, quietly watching laundry whirl within.

                          peter
                     (regarding the laundry.)
                thought it was my week for that.

                          susan
                     (shrugs.)
                i needed to think. it was either this
                or the weather channel.

     peter walks over, kisses her.  he notices an open book of
     insect morphology on her lap. there's a full color
     photograph of an ootheca -- an insect eggcase.
