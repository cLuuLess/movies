     ext. flophouse - day

     the department of health van pulls up outside the flophouse
     where the chinese preacher died. peter and josh get out.

     cops push back a few onlookers. josh proudly flashes his doh
     badge.

                          josh
                health department...

     the cops let them pass.

                          peter
                you really love flashing that thing,
                don't you?

                          josh
                hey. i'm a short guy. waddaya want?

     two cops -- woychek and rice -- approach, in no real hurry.

                          peter
                peter tyler, doh. you gentlemen were
                the first on the scene?

                          woychek
                     (gestures to rice)
                we were both on patrol, saw this paint
                mess. then i looked through that cellar
                window. we both did...

                          peter
                you gone in?

                          woychek
                no. we waited.

                          peter
                good.

     peter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor.

     through the oily, smeared window, a ghostly array of pale
     face and hands appears, startling him.

                          peter
                     (to josh)
                get the emt's in there, now.

                                                            cut to:

     later

     paramedic ambulances rush in. sirens at full blast.

     stepping out of the building across, manny walks next to
     chuy, who holds his hand. the old man carries a box full of
     shoes.

     chuy looks back at the cop circus, amused.

                          manny
                c'mon chuy, we're gonna be late.
                     (discreetly crossing himself)
                cops are bad news. don't look at them.

     he gently pulls his grandson's hand and moves briskly away.

     josh

     uses an iron bar, and breaks a padlocked cellar door. a heavy
     stench emanates from inside. the cops cover their noses.
