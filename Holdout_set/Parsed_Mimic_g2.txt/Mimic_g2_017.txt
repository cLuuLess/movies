     int. cellar

     peter and josh enter a dingy, dungeon-like cellar,
     illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights. every
     door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy-duty
     padlock. peter and josh walk through the dismal scene.

     in sharp contrast with the dirt-smeared walls, we see shiny
     metallic sewing machines and swatches of cloth appliqued with
     a funny bunny cartoon character.

     josh examines the label stitched into the collar. it reads:
     proudly made in usa.

                          peter
                jesus.

     his light hits a group of quivering, skeletal chinese
     immigrants, standing in a tight group against a wall.
