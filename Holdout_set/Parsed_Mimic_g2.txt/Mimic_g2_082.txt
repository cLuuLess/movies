     int. subway repair car - later

     we now see the car is 50's vintage.  a poster of mickey
     mantle above an empty worktable.

     peter sits before susan.  she's trembling, understandably
     shaken from her previous experience.  blood pours from a cut
     on her forehead.

     peter takes a bit of torn cloth, puts it to the wound, then
     tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place.

                          peter
                just keep holding it.  can you do that
                for me?
                     (no reponse.)
                susan?

     susan nods silently.  her hand weakly presses the compress.

                          manny (os)
                doctor tyler?

     he turns to manny, who sits solicitously next to leonard.
     his wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages. he begins to
     stir.

     peter gets up, but susan's hand is closed tightly around his,
     like the jaws of the mimic.  he kisses her gently, then
     slowly manages to release his hand.

     he walks to leonard, inspects his wound. touches the sole of
     his foot.

                          peter
                you feel anything?

                          leonard
                yeah, i feel like ripping your
                fucking eyes out...

                          peter
                leonard, listen.  i need to see if
                there's any nerve damage before we
                carry you back.
                     (no response.)
                look, i'm trying to help you here...

                          leonard
                oh, you helped me here, all right, white
                boy.  you and your goddam memo. you
                needed to prove your point, uh?

                          peter
                i'm sorry.  but i don't think letting you
                bleed to death is the best apology.

     peter touches his foot again. leonard finally nods.

     manny gazes at the mimic carcass at the end of the car.

                          manny
                where the hell'd that thing come from?

     peter looks at susan.  she remains silent.

                          peter
                     (quietly)
                a mistake.

                          leonard
                "mistake"?  what's that supposed to...?

                          peter
                it doesn't matter, all right?  it's dead.

                          leonard
                how you know that?  shit, it was runnin'
                around with its buttside gone and a
                fucking pipe through its heart...

                          susan
                     (quietly)
                it doesn't have a heart.

     peter looks up at her.

                          susan
                just inner chambers...

                          manny
                but it look like a man. it... i saw it.

                          susan
                no...

     she gets up, finally moving.

                          susan
                that's what it wanted you to see.

                                                            cut to:

     outside car

     the subway car sits at the end of the platform, windows dimly
     glowing in the dark. the door opens, and manny and peter
     snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car.

     inside car - a little later

     the lower half of the insect has been moved into the car.
     susan is reassembling it.

                          peter
                so, you're saying this is like those bugs
                that -- that look like twigs or leaves
                or...

                          susan
                     (shakes her head)
                that's camouflage...

     susan displays the partly-charred head.

                          susan
                this is mimicry. they evolve to mimic
                their predators. a butterfly can look
                like the eyes of an owl.  a catterpillar
                can copy a snake...

     susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a self-contained
     bud shape, then pushes back the "face" mandibles.

                          susan
                this has evolved to mimic the most
                dangerous predator it's ever had...

     she holds it in her hand, like yorick's skull. the mimic's
     head obscenely mirrors her own. she inserts it into the
     shoulder cavity.

     she stands back.

                          susan
                us.

     camera cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like
     the overcoat man.

                          susan
                mantids can mimic. we gave the judas
                that code...

                          manny
                     (quotes)
                "...and behold he will come that walks as
                a man, yet is not a man- ..."

                          susan
                this, is our baby peter. yours and
                mine. aren't you proud?

     outside of the car - in the tunnels

     we see four shadows move fast, scuttling on the walls and
     ceiling...

     ...heading towards the car...

     inside the car

     a subway map on the wall.  red, blue, and orange lines
     branching through the boroughs like veins.

                          susan
                all these...they're like tunnels of an
                insect colony. once these things hit a
                certain population density, they'll have
                to move out, form new colonies.

     the realization hits the others.

                          susan
                we have to get help down here.  burn
                the tunnels before...

     she's interrupted by a clicking from the tunnel ahead.

     it's answered by clicking from the tunnel behind.

                          leonard
                get the doors!

     a brief glimpse down the car shows too many other doors to
     close in time.

                          peter
                is there a switch?

                          leonard
                third rail is dead.
                     (to manny and susan.)
                get me up.  there must be a manual
                override in the booth.

     manny and susan help leonard up.

                          susan
                     (whispering to peter)
                the lights!

     peter turns off the flashlights.

     susan and manny help leonard to the car's control booth.

     peter looks

     outside

     where the silhouette of a mimic moves to the rear of the car.

     control booth

     leonard opens a box on the side-wall marked manual override.

     inside, there is a large, hexagonal shaped hole.

                          leonard
                     (starts looking around)
                where's the damn crank?!

     outside

     the mimic is only yards away.

     other shadows emerge from the distant dark.

     inside

     manny leaves leonard and susan to look for the lever crank.

     he runs to help peter try and shut the doors manually.

     but it's useless.  many of the doors won't budge.

                          peter
                     (hissing a whisper)
                they're coming!

     outside

     the shadows get nearer, their clicking louder...

     control booth

     susan looks under the dashboard, finds a hexagonal shaped
     rod.  the lever crank.

                          susan
                i got it!

     susan gives it to leonard. he jams the rod into the hexagonal
     shaped hole.  perfect fit.

     leonard begins cranking the thing.  but it's rusty and
     slow...

                          susan
                hurry! please!

     throughout subway car

     the doors begin to swing shut very slowly.

     outside - a mimic's pov

     sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.

     control booth

     leonard can't crank fast enough.  susan joins in, putting her
     hands over leonard's.  both spin the thing as fast as
     possible.

     subway car

     peter and manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up
     the closing process.

     shadows are seen approaching, now very close.

     control booth

     leonard and susan put all their effort into turning the crank
     one more time...

                          leonard
                come on, you son-of-a...

     subway car

     a soft click as the doors shut in unison.

     silence.

     all four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the
     blast of depth charges.  their eyes dart to the

     windows

     caked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the
     red flares.

     thuck! something bumps against the door.

     a machine-gun patter of footsteps on the roof.

     the car shakes.

     outside

     the dark platform is alive with phantom shapes.

     inside

     screeech!! something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a
     nail over a chalkboard.

     thump! thump!  impacts on the sides...

     an obscene symphony of sounds as mimics lay siege to the car.

     peter

     a buzz of wings catches his attention.  he turns.  his face
     is reflected in a security window.

     crack!  the window splinters, destroying peter's reflection.

     above manny

     claws scratch the ceiling. it begins to dent.

     below susan and leonard

     large forms clicking underneath, looking for a way in.

     susan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of
     the clicking...

     ...which leads to leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg.

                          susan
                oh, god.
                     (looks at leonard.)
                the blood...

     klanggg!  a mimic leg pierces the ceiling above them!

     susan pulls leonard out of the way just in time as

     in the subway car

     klang!  klang! more legs break through the ceiling!

     susan and leonard

     emerge from the control booth, leonard's arm over susan's
     shoulder.

                          susan
                his blood! it's driving them crazy! we
                have to mask the odor!

                          peter
                how?!

     but there's not time enough to discuss possible solutions.

     leonard pulls off his jacket. susan begins wrapping it around
     his wound to mask it. manny helps.

     peter has upended one shelf, jamming it against a broken
     window as a barricade.

     despite their efforts, the mimics are not thrown off the
     scent.

                          peter
                it's no use! they know we're in here!

                          susan
                they don't know anything peter, they
                just sense. they're hardwired!

                          peter
                right. hardwired to eat anything that's
                not like them!

     the whole car is now shaking and buckling.

                          susan
                exac...

     she looks over at the severed mimic corpse nearby.  a
     realization...

                          susan
                     (to manny)
                give me your razor.

     manny looks at her blankly. susan just takes the blade.

     the whole car is now shaking and buckling.

     she runs to the mimic's carcass.  for a moment, she
     hesitates.  but the pandemonium leaves her little choice.

     she slices into the mimic's corpse with the razor...

                          peter
                what are you doing?

     ...sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow...

     ...and pulls out two fat amber sacs the size of
     softballs.  she slices them open.

     orange goo leaks out, its stench overpowering.

                          leonard
                     (covers his nose)
                shit!

     peter looks up as susan slides one of the sacs over to
     him.

                          susan
                rub it on the windows!

                          peter
                what-

                          susan
                just do it!!

     holding his breath, against the stench, he smears the
     crap on the windows, the doorframe...

     manny

     looks to the roof, listening.

     and remarkably, the sounds of the mimics start
     subsiding.

     susan comes over to leonard, begins dabbing the goop on
     leonard's wound.  leonard makes a face at the stink.

                          leonard
                what are you putting that crap on me
                for?

                          susan
                scent glands.  insects use 'em to
                identify themselves to each other.

     she smears the floor area behind leonard. the activity winds
     down gradually, and finally comes almost to a halt.

                                                            cut to:

     subway car - later

     leaning against the dirtied window, manny creates a streak
     for every mimic he sees.

     peter, leonard and susan are hard at work. leonard has
     created a small "model" of the station using pocket debris
     and the wall map.

                          leonard (o.s.)
                okay. that's us.

     manny's lighter represents the subway car.

                          leonard
                this track we're on? goes down into
                the repair area.
                     (makes an "x" further down)
                the elevator's over here. leads up to
                the active tunnels.

     thump! an oily, soft abdomen brushes lazily up against
     the glass. manny moves away.

                          peter
                can we get this car there?

                          leonard
                someone'd have to go to the
                switchroom, pull the coupling lever,
                that'll send us left and to the
                elevator.

                          susan
                but the power...

                          leonard
                hell, i might be able to juice the whole
                area, if i can get to the power box. it's
                just a couple of cables...

                          manny
                oh, how you gonna get there, leonard?
                hop?

                          peter
                     (to leonard)
                just talk me through it. i can go with
                manny.

                          leonard
                it would take a minute or so.
                     (beat)
                you won't last that long out there.

                          susan
                peter, you couldn't even fix our tv!

     tense silence. he points at the glands on the floor.

                          peter
                we'll cover ourselves with this. they
                can mimic us-  we goddam mimic them!

                          susan
                peter-

                          peter
                it worked before...

                          susan
                     (an edge in her voice)
                the scent won't last...

                          peter
                that's why we should do it now.

     susan knows they have no other choice.

     later

     susan is stuffing leonard's old bloody bandages into the
     thorax of the dead mimic.  she ties a flare to its center.

                          leonard
                it's just a regular old pump switch,
                okay? right by the track signal
                board.

     manny is spreading the mucus-like liquid of the gland-sac on
     himself and peter as leonard instructs them-

                          leonard
                the lights come up, you pull the
                switch.

                          manny
                i pull.

                          leonard
                you don't do that, we're on the wrong
                track.
                     (turns to peter)
                you...

     the two men look into each other's eyes.

                          leonard
                you gonna finally get to fuck around
                with the wires.  think you can
                handle it?

                          peter
                depends.  you got a memo?

     leonard's hard feelings give way to an almost
     imperceptible smile.

     using a ballpoint pen, he draws a schematic on the back
     of peter's hand.

                          leonard
                all right then.  you gonna find two
                wires.  one's green.  the other's
                blue...

     susan

     approaches manny, who looks distractedly out the window.

                          manny
                he's out there. i heard him. how can
                he be? this things...

                          susan
                manny...

                          manny
                i didn't protect him, lady. he
                trusted me. and i didn't protect
                him... his father...i lost his father
                to the streets and now, chuy...

                          susan
                we'll find him. we'll be back and
                find him.

     manny doesn't respond.

     ready to go

     susan dabs at peter's face with the last touches of the
     scent gland substance.  she doesn't meet his eyes as she
     speaks.

                          susan
                you're going to have to keep it
                really slow.  their eyes react to
                sudden movements.

     peter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge.  he
     instinctively goes to wipe his forehead.  susan stops
     him.

                          susan
                don't touch it.  and for godsakes,
                try not to sweat.  they can sense
                chemical changes...

                          peter
                try not to sweat?

     leonard turns to susan and peter.

                          leonard
                okay, people...

     leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.

                          leonard (os)
                ...are we ready for this?

     susan has her hand on peter's chest; peter is taking deep
     breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat.  it's
     an odd parody of lamaze exercise.

                          leonard
                whatever you do, don't step on the
                third rail coming back. six hundred
                volts'll blow your leg right off.

     a final breath.  he's about as calm as he's going to get.

     he looks at susan a long moment. he takes her hand.

                          peter
                i was just thinking how i could use a
                pair of pliers... and i remembered where
                they are...

                          susan
                     (overlapping)
                that's it. that's it. breathe easy.

     a sad, nervous smile appears on peter's face.

                          peter
                in the tool box under the kitchen
                counter...

     susan kisses him softly on the lips.

     manny approaches.  show time.

     susan steps away from peter. she looks toward the control
     booth.

                          susan
                open it.

     leonard

     begins turning the lever crank slowly.

     subway doors

     gradually begin to open, and stop half way.

     the darkness outside is alive with clicking.

     peter and manny

     slowly move between the opening of the door and make their
     way to
