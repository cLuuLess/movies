     int. train - conductor

     we rush toward his horrified face.

     the albino

     directly ahead.

     the train, still flying, plows into it...

     ...flattening, grinding, pulverizing...

     ...until the windshield of the subway car is covered in white
     blood.

     the motoran leans on the brake, his eyes screwed shut in
     primal horror. the train squeals to a stop...

     on the platform

     susan and peter collapse on the cement floor in each others
     arms.  heaving and weeping.
