     int. vaulted area

     peter and josh put the fecal samples into the back-pack.

     leonard stands at the other end of the area. he inspects some
     old scaffolding set up at an opening which leads to

     the remains of an old station

     fifteen feet below.

                          leonard
                i've never been this deep. this area
                here is the old armory station. they
                built it in the 40's. ran out of money
                half-way through...

     it's like grand central's dead little brother. tiled mosaic
     walls, columns, monumental arches. spaces for shops. a group
     of abandoned turn-of-the-century subway cars on parallel
     tracks.

                          leonard
                okay, the fat lady's singing. time to go.

     everything is gray with dust.

                          peter (o.s.)
                     (to josh)
                i want a team in here by six tonight,
                hands and knees with toothpicks...

     leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding.

     a nymph -- big as the one seen earlier -- emerges from a pile
     of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound.

     keeping his eyes fixed on the insect, leonard coolly bends
     down, picks up a rock.

     peter

     putting the last sample boxes into the back-pack, looks up
     and sees

     leonard

     step onto the scaffolding, raising the rock to crush the
     nymph.

                          peter
                don't!!

     smash! leonard tosses the rock at the insect, crushing it.

     peter rushes to the insect's corpse on the scaffolding.

                          leonard
                did you see the size of that thing?!

                          peter
                look what you did! you stupid sonofa-

     a creak from the scaffolding at their combined weight.

     leonard grabs peter, tries to pull him from the scaffolding.

     creeeeaaaaak!

     the entire scaffolding gives way!

     buckling diagonally...

     ...taking peter and leonard with it...

     crash!  both peter and leonard are thrown to the ground of
     the station below.  the scaffolding falls around them.

     josh

     rushes forward.

                          josh
                peter!

     peter and leonard

     stir in the wreckage.  peter rises shakily.  he puts his
     glasses on. one of the lenses is badly smashed.

                          peter
                it's okay.  i'm all right.

     he tries to help leonard up; leonard knocks his hand away.

                          leonard
                get the hell away from me!

     peter looks up at josh.

                          peter
                     (deadpan)
                he's all right, too.

     leonard brushes himself off, checks out his walkie-talkie.
     it's been broken in the fall, a tangle of plastic and wires.
     he curses under his breath.

     peter checks the wall for a handhold.  but there's only
     smooth tile and dust.

                          leonard
                oh, that's gonna work.

                          peter
                you got a better way up?

     leonard removes his badge, tosses it up to josh.

                          leonard
                     (to josh.)
                show that to the station manager.  tell
                him leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt
                he don't have someone down here in ten.

                          josh
                h-how do i get...?

                          leonard
                way we came.  take the first tunnel to
                your right...

     leonard's voice echoes off the cavernous walls. josh
     hurriedly writes it down in his notebook.

                          leonard (os)
                go left.  go left again till you hit the
                fork... then right again. you got that?

                          josh
                i think so. one right, two lefts...

                          leonard
                and a right.

                          josh
                right.

                          peter
                go josh. now.

     josh obeys.

                                                            cut to:
