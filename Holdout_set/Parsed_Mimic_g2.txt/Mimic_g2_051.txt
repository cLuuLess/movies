     int. manny's apartment - night

     salmon-colored light slants in from sodium vapor streetlight.
     pan through the shadowy room, past manny's sleeping form to
     chuy, asleep under a tent made of an old star wars blanket.

     a rhythmical clicking sound is heard from outside.

     chuy pops his head out from under the blanket, listening.
