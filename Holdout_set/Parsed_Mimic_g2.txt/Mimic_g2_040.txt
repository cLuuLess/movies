     int. hole - susan's hand

     as susan's hand moves closer, the strange face begins to
     tremble.

     a clicking sound.

     susan's hand is almost there.

     susan

     reaches further.

     and suddenly a beam of light cuts through the darkness.

     their vision resolves. the figures of two mta cops stand
     before them:  ernest, 50, burly and bull-necked; and leonard
     -- african american, 45, more formidable than fat.

                          leonard
                     (wearily)
                now don't tell me.
