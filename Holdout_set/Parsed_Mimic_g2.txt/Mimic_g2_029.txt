     int. tyler apartment - night

     peter enters the apartment, which has long since been
     remodeled with a nicer couch and a bigger tv with slightly
     better reception.

                          peter
                sus?

     no answer.  he notices the dining room table is filled with
     yellowed files, all marked judas traditor.

                          peter
                     (looks around once again)
