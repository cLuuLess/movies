     ext. fire escape - night

     wearing only his pajama bottoms, chuy steps out on the fire
     escape with his spoons in hand.

     the clicking resumes from the building across the street.

     overhead view

     the barefoot little boy crosses the street, steps through the
     center of the huge paint stain on the sidewalk.

     the clicking sound comes again.

     street level

     the clicking comes again from inside the flophouse.  it
     continues a little bit, then stops.

     chuy clicks his spoons together, mimicking the sound.

     beat.  a clicking from within again; almost an answer.

     chuy ducks under the yellow doh tape, walks toward the front
     of the building.

     he comes to the boarded entrance.  there is a hole, narrow,
     and low in the doorway.

     chuy squats, begins to wriggle through it.
