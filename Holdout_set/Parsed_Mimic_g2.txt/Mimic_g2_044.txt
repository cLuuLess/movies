     int. subway tracks - dusk

     a train blurs by.

     a flashlight beam over dirty gravel.  tilt with the beam to
     see ernest walking his beat past tracks and girders.  hulking
     out-of-service subway cars surround him. he shines his light
     on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls.

     a sound catches his attention.  a rustling.

     he notices something off to a corner, walks over to it.

     a shiny brown lump in the corner, covered in garbage.

     he touches the lump with his shoe.  it stirs slightly.

     he touches it again...

     ...and a pair of legs suddenly lash out, kicking at him
     reflexively.

     ernest jumps back.

     another set of legs emerges...

     oddly enough, ernest relaxes.

                          ernest
                chrissakes...

     he grabs the surface of the lump, and pulls it.  we see that
     it was just a shiny brown tarp.

     underneath, a group of three homeless people -- emaciated,
     toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. in the dim
     light, they almost seem like a single organism.

                          ernest
                guys, c'mon.

     the homeless people stare back at him mutely.  ernest starts
     getting annoyed.

                          ernest
                i told you to stick by the maintenance
                area.

                          bag lady
                nah... it's private property now.

     ernest looks at her, confused.

                          skeletal bum
                he eats down there.

                          ernest
                who?

                          homeless man
                the stickman.

                          bag lady
                long john.

     the homeless man points.  ernest turns his light.

     another silhouette of the overcoat man drawn on the wall. an
     arrow below it points east.

                          ernest
                graffiti artist, uh?
                     (to homeless people)
                look guys, just get off my beat, you
                hear?  get moving.

     ernest hustles them out.  the homeless people glare at him,
     pick up their things and head into the gloom.

     ernest watches them go.  he turns back to the graffiti
     painting of the stickman.

                                                       dissolve to:
