     ext. a city street - day

     midtown manhattan.  a cacophony of sound and light.

     dirty snow drifts over bryant park. emergency lights blink
     everywhere. a wall of cars sits on sixth avenue, stopped
     dead. exhaust fumes hang in the air. jaded traffic cops send
     the cars on crosstown detours.

     mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near
     dozens of department of public health vehicles, angle-parked
     in a military phalanx.

     a monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the
     middle of the street, "sealing" the area with amber plastic.

     inside, uniformed workers take the disposal drum of roaches
     and toss it into one of a number of huge dumpsters.

     the team leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  her mask is
     off. we see her face: enthomologist susan wyeth, 28.

     an arm gently drapes over her shoulder.

                          peter (os)
                how we doing?

     she looks over at dr. peter tyler, 34, bespectacled.  a
     headset around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the
     department of health logo.  he has the look of a man who's
     just fought a long battle and come out victorious.

                          susan
                we'll see...

     he offers her a bite of a pay day candybar.  susan smiles,
     shakes her head.  she wearily leans against him.

     peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised
     by mechanical arms into the waiting maw of the dump truck.

     the screen. darkness.

     a voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.

                          anchorman (vo)
                strickler's disease crept into manhattan
                like a thief in the night, claiming its
                first hundred victims before it was even
                classified.
