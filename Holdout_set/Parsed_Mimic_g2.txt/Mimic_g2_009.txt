     int. bathroom

                          peter
                life's a bitch. our 15 minutes came
                and went and all we got was bad
                cable...

     susan doesn't answer, clearly not in the same high spirits.

                          peter
                hiding from the hard glare of publicity?

     he notices her crumpled garment on the floor.  he picks it
     up, puts it up on the hanger.

                          peter
                a shame.  you looked great tonight.

                          susan
                please.

                          peter
                you did!

     he sits by the tub.

                          susan
                do you think we did the right thing?

                          peter
                taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?

                          susan
                you know what i mean...

     peter pours some champagne into the cups.

                          susan
                we did no impact evaluation.  the
                consequences of...

                          peter
                     (sighs)
                is this a catholic guilt thing...?

     we hear a newsreader on the tv.

                          newsreader (tv)
                ...a flawless strategy which has stopped
                a potential epidemic in its tracks...

                          peter
                you hear that?  flawless.

                          susan
                we just don't know.

     he offers one cup to susan.  she doesn't take it.

                          peter
                we know we saved lives.

     he sits closer to her.

                          peter
                there're gonna be a lot of kids running
                around next year because of you.

     beat.  susan starts to relax. he kisses her.

                          peter
                who know?  we get lucky, maybe a couple
                of 'em'll be ours.

                          susan
                     (smiling now)
                we're down to a "couple" now, huh?

     she pats the water, beckoning.

                          peter
                oh, i don't know. people are beginning
                to talk about us...

     still partially clothed, he steps into the bathtub. susan
     shakes her head, laughs ruefully.

                          susan
                don't worry, i'll save your honor.
                maybe i'll even marry you.

     she reaches over, kisses him.
