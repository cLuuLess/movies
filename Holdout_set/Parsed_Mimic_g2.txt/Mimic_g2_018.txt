     int. stairwell, museum - dusk

     carrying boxes full of terrarium material, susan and siri
     ride an antiquated cage-steel elevator.  no floor buttons,
     just an old-fashioned hand-activated lever.

                          susan
                ...as long as they're ready for the
                opening i don't care, just tell them
                that.

                          siri
                i'm on it.  don't worry.
                     (beat)
                look, susan...i don't mean to pry,
                but... i kinda overheard you and
                peter.

                          susan
                     (smiles ironically)
                watch your step, siri.  your grant
                could be on the line here.

                          siri
                i just...well, i had this cousin in
                delhi.  she was having problems, too.
                she, ah...

                          susan
                what?

                          siri
                she used a baster.

     susan looks at her.

                          siri
                not a big one.  i mean, it was like a
                turkey baster.

                          susan
                oh, jesus.

     she tries to stop the elevator at the fourth floor, but
     it rises just a little too far.

                          susan
                come on, darlin'...

     susan has to jimmy the lever till the elevator falls
     level to the floor.

                          siri
                     (continues)
                she kept it under her bed. thing is,
                it kinda worked.  i mean, she had to
                hide it from her husband, but...

     a pair of young boys, ricky and davis, sit on the floor
     outside susan's lab door.  a crumpled paper bag and a shoe
     box sit beside them.

                          susan
                what's this?

                          siri
                oh, right... they been here since noon.
                i told them you're real busy.

     susan smiles at the boys, who stand when they see her.

                          susan
                hello.

                          ricky
                you the bug lady, right?

     siri chuckles.

                          susan
                     (smiles)
                i suppose so.

     ricky raises and shakes the paper bag.

                          ricky
                we're here to deal.
