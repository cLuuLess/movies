     int. emergency room

     raymond, peter, and several other er staff work on siri,
     now lying on an operating table.

                          raymond
                     (to peter)
                all hands on deck, pete. remember the
                dril?

                          peter
                it'll come back to me.

     raymond inspects siri's wounded hand.  the bandage has
     been removed.  the bite-wound is infected and
     suppurating.  a large red circular rash around it.

                          peter
                looks like a lyme disease rash.

                          raymond
                it's not consistent with the internal
                bleeding. any idea what bit her?

     peter shakes his head.

                          raymond
                i think we're gonna need to have that
                specimen here.

     an assistant finishes inserting a catheter down her
     throat.

     blood and fluid leak up through the clear tube.

     above the operating theater.

     staring down through the circular glass deck, susan
     silently observes the procedures.
