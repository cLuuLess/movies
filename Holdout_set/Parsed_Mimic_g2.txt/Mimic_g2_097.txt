     int. a platform

     susan and peter stumble forward.  light streams down from
     overheads. susan turns.

     susan's pov

     the albino spills out onto the track behind them.

     sleek, streamlined, light glancing beautifully off it.

     susan and peter

     turn back...

     headlights hit them as we hear the roar of a subway train
     heading at them from the other side of the platform!

                          susan
                no...

                          peter
                we can do it!

     they run.

     albino

     train

     the express train blows its horn, rushing forward.

     a sleepy-eyed little girl points, tugging on her mother's
     hand.

                          little girl

     peter and susan

                          peter
                     (adrenaline pumping)
                we-can-do-this!!!

     motorman

     the driver sees the battered couple...

     he reaches for the brake...

     susan and peter

     they reach the edge of the platform, the horn deafening as
     the train speeds toward them.  peter pushes susan up, leaps-
