     int. manny's apartment - predawn

     the blue hours before dawn. laconic movement outside.  new
     york dragging itself out of bed.

     we find manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot
     plate. he addresses chuy's tented bed behind him.

                my father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get
                a pitcher. cold water, whoosh, i tell you
                that's some alarm clock, brrrrr!

     manny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them
     in a star-shaped pattern. a breakfast ritual of some kind.

                          manny
                ah! there you go! the way you like 'em,
                chu-chu...
                     (he pours a glass of milk.)
                we're low on milk, you remind grampa to
                pick some up tonight, okay?

     he walks over to chuy's tent bed. he pulls the sheets aside.

     his grandson is gone.
