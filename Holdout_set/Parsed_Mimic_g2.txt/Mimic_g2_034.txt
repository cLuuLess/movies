     ext. outside car

     susan rushes over, removes something from the windshield
     wiper.

     a butterfly, its wing pinned under the rubber flapper.
     she holds it in her palm, then looks up at peter.

                          susan
                metaxonycha godmani.

                          peter
                so?

     susan looks around.  just ahead is an empty lot surrounded by
     a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and
     performance artists.

     an identical butterfly perches on the edge of a board.
