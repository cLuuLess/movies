     peter's right hand man, josh maslow -- a young, good-natured,
     can-do guy -- drives.

                          josh
                ...so i say "buddy, you have every
                violation in the book.  gimme one
                good reason not to close you down."
                you know what the kraut says to me?

     in the back, peter finishes changing out of his jogging
     sweats and into his worksuit.

                          josh
                the blintzes!  "try the blintzes..."

                          peter
                     (distractedly)
                selling your sould for a fistful of
                carbohydrates...

                          josh
                not just any carbohydrates, mind you.
                it was like being on the receiving
                end of some kind of transcendent oral
                sex.
                     (honks furiously)
                we should get a strobe on this thing.
                maybe even a siren.

                          peter
                yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can
                yell "epidemic! epidemic! you're all
                going to die!"
