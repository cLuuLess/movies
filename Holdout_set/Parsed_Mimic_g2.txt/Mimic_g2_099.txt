     int. grand central station - night

     commuters turn to stare as peter and susan move across
     the floor.  both bruised and bloodied, leaning against
     each other, heading for the exit.

     some derelicts observe them with curiosity.

     a trio of mta cops start towards them.

                          peter
                it'll be fine... it... they're still
                down there. we'll seal the whole
                system, go in with whatever it
                takes...

     but peter's voice evidences a lack of conviction now,
     he's trying to convince both susan and himself of
     something he doesn't fully believe.

                          peter
                it'll be fine... we nailed them
                before, we'll do it again...

     he hurries to meet the mta cops. susan looks up.

     susan's pov

     commuters move to and fro, moving up and down and in and
     out of the illuminated areas of the station.

     in the crush of onlookers is one deadpan face-  a mimic,
     hugging the shadows, waiting for its moment!

     we pan 180 degrees to the other side of the platform-
     there, briefly glimpsed is another, and another.

     we tilt down to the throng below.

                          susan
                     (barely audible)
                they've come up...

     the electrified voice of the train announcer suddenly
     fades up, telling of departures and delays-

     we raise above susan's head-

                          train announcer
                the 11:16 local to poughkeepsie,
                boarding now, track 32- the 7:20
                connecticut local, making
                connections to south norwalk-

     down angle

     -culminating in an overhead view of the main terminal.

     the movement continues. but from here, the people are
     dots, their importanec no greater than that of a colony
     of ants.
