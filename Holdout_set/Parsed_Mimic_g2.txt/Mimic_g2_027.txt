     int. manny's apartment - same

     chuy sits at the window, twisting wire into a human-like
     figure.  moving past him, we see a group of other wire
     figures on the table, backs of chairs, lamps, everywhere.

     manny sits at the kitchen table. he ignites a can of shoe
     polish with a match, then lights a cigarette off the flame.

     he puts the cigarette in his mouth and proceeds to polish a
     pair of shoes. a silly show plays over the tv.

                          manny
                not too little, not too much. you rub it
                in, around and around like this. let the
                leather take it.

     manny leans tiredly against the table. he looks fatigued
     and in pain. he takes a small pill and places it under
     his tongue.

                          manny
                you watching? you should learn to
                work the shoes. you're good with your
                hands...

     manny shoots a glance over to his grandson.

                          manny
                chuy...you gonna get all wet.

     chuy doesn't pay attention, just stares out at the street.

                          manny
                did you look at the story book i got you?

     manny lifts a brightly colored children's book.

                          manny
                our animal friends.  can you say that,
                chico?  "friends"?

     nothing from chuy.

     chuy's pov - street

     the building across the street. yellow doh tape at the
     entrance.

                          manny (os)
                a friend is the one you can trust.  when
                you are with a friend, no matter where in
                the world, you are at home.

     a figure moves out of the shadows and totters in the rain
     toward the entrance.  it is the overcoat man, barely visible
     in the rain.

                          manny
                in this city. a friend is a hard thing to
                find...

     chuy

     his face shows a bit of animation.

                          chuy
                funny shoes...

     manny looks up from the book.

                          chuy
                alli.  mr. funny shoes.

     manny comes over, looks out.

     their pov

     the figure has disappeared into the dark front of the
     boarded-up building.

     manny and chuy

                          manny
                no one is there. is empty.

     chuy doesn't respond.  manny turns the boy's face to his.

                          manny
                chuy, listen to me.  they have jesus on
                the cross, but that is not a holy place.
                you understand?

     chuy looks at him blankly.  manny sighs; he knows he doesn't.

                          manny
                ah, nino.  god only knows what goes on in
                your head, eh?

     he pats the boy on the head, then goes back to work. chuy
     turns back to stare at the street.

                          chuy
                mr. funny shoes...

                                                            cut to:
