     int. switchroom

     manny enters. the space is even more dusty than the rest of
     the station. spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  white
     doric pillars support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1940s
     style lamps are built into their side.

     manny looks around.  off to the right, right next to the
     rusted track switch board, he heads for the coupling switch.

     once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he
     waves back to leonard.

     he pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. but his hands
     are shaking, under enormous tension. some of the pills
     scatter on the floor. he puts the box away and leans
     against the wall.

     a clicking nearby catches his attention, echoing from the
     entrance of another room.

     it is not the sound of the mimics; but rather, of metal.

     spoons.

                          manny
                chuy...?

     manny follows the sound.

     by the track

     peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way.
     he wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance
     of color.

     he feels himself start to sweat.  he tries to relax.
     breathes...
