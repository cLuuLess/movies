     int. manny's apartment - night

     on manny's dining room table, a heap of unpolished shoes has
     accumulated. the radio is playing a sad, elegiac tango.

                          manny
                no, no, please understand... i can't
                wait that long.

     looking disheveled and tired, manny clutches the phone,
     listening intently.

                          manny
                please. i write it down.
                     (he writes)
                2... 8... 7... 3. what does this mean
                "case number"? okay. so, now what?  when
                can you...?

     he holds a color snapshot of chuy sitting on a mailbox.

                          manny
                no, i can't wait...no, listen...

     click. manny slowly hangs up. he stares at his notepad, at
     the number 2873.

                          manny
                hijos de puta.

     he crumples it up, throws it away, crosses to the window,
     picks up chuy's last wire figure-

     figure, closer

     another human-looking figure, long and thin, but with
     something slightly off about it.

     it has six limbs instead of four!

     manny

     frowns, looks down at the dark flophouse across the street.

                          manny
                mr. funny shoes.

     distant thunder is heard.

     bathroom cabinet

     manny takes a straight razor from the bathroom cabinet, opens
     the blade.
