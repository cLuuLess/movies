     int. exhibition floor

     exhibits under glass set up throughout the room: insect
     chambers and vaults of great complexity, etc.

     an opening night crowd of affluent museum patrons.  all
     tuxedoes and painted smiles.  some peremptorily peruse the
     displays; most just camp out at the buffet table.

     peter enters, dressed in his worksuit.  he scans the
     room, sees siri leaning against a wall by the buffet
     table, drinking an orange juice.  he goes over to her.

                          peter
                heya.
                     (kisses her on the cheek.)
                where's the boss?

     siri gestures to the far end of the room.  susan stands
     alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ant mound exhibit.

                          siri
                ant mound.

     peter notices siri seems unusually weary. she covers one
     of her eyes.

                          peter
                you okay?

                          siri
                it's just a headache.  we were
                sandblasting trump tower here since
                four this morning.

                          peter
                maybe you should sit...

                          siri
                i'm fine. go talk to susan.  she could
                use a good word right now.

     she nods for him to go ahead.  peter leaves.

     siri closes her eyes.  she rubs the bandage around the
     insect bite on her hand.

     peter

     approaches susan.  she's staring through thr glass panes
     of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons.  in the
     refraction, their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem
     to blend into one another.

                          peter
                great crowd.

                          susan
                no such thing, baby.

     she looks over at the crowd congregated around the
     buffet table.

                          susan
                i get the feeling they came more for
                the potroast than the apterids.

                          peter
                fuck 'em.  they don't know what
                they're missing.

                          susan
                     (distantly)
                right.

     peter looks at her.

                          peter
                what's wrong?

     susan sighs.

                          susan
                oh...nothing that a little
                menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't
                cure. least that's what i thought.

     peter looks at her, notices that one of her hands is on
     her stomach.

                          peter
                     (genuinely moved)
                oh, no, you were-

                          susan
                i was just late.

     susan nods.  peter takes her hand. they sit by the ant
     mound.

                          susan
                ironic, don't you think?  these guys
                can hatch hundreds of offspring in a
                single clutch of eggs, right? and
                here we are...

                          peter
                susan, we're not b-

                          siri (os)
                susan?

     susan looks up to see siri standing on the other side of
     the glass case.

                          siri
                     (weakly.)
                i'm sorry.  i think...i need...

     one of her eyes is completely bloodshot. her mouth is
     bleeding. she puts her hand on the case to steady
     herself.

     her fingers leave a streak of blood on the glass.

                          susan
                siri...

     siri collapses.  the exhibit tips over.

     peter pulls susan out of the way just as the exhibit
     falls and smashes to the ground!

                          susan
                siri!

     the room erupts into commotion.

     susan and peter run to siri, who lies unconscious on the
     floor.

     peter gently turns her over.

     siri's bleeding from the corner of her mouth.  just like
     the chinese workers in the sweatshop.

     tuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds.

                                                  smash cut to:
