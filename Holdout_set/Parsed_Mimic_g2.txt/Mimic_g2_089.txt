     a skeletal framework on each side.  just enough for a
     handhold.

     peter steadies susan as she climbs in beside him.  she
     balances on the narrow ledge.

     peter slams the cage door shut, latching it.

                          peter
                you go first. i'll be right below you.

                          susan
                your arm, you can't...

                          peter
                i can.  we can do this...

     he shows her the first hand and foothold.  susan grabs on.
