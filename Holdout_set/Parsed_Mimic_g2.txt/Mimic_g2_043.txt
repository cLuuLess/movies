     int. subway stairs - day

     susan and peter walk up the stairs; peter still fumes.

                          peter
                you give someone a fucking uniform
                and... did you hear how he talked to us?

                          susan
                i heard how you talked to him.

                          peter
                oh, so i'm the bad guy now?

     susan spares him an ironic look.

                          susan
                he was just doing his job.

                          peter
                fine, then i'm the bad guy. jesus!

     at the top of the stairs they're completely engulfed by
     sunlight.

                          peter
                he wants a permit, i'll get him a
                permit.
