     int. by the elevator gate

     the mimics are tearing at the metal gate.

     the albino remains still, watching them work.

     peter and susan

     susan's arm and legs are shaking now.  her breath starts
     catching in her throat with the effort.

                          peter
                don't hold your breath!  keep it going,
                even flow!

     susan tried, but can't.  she tries to pull herself up to the
     next level.

                          peter
                c'mon...

                          susan
                ah...

                          peter
                talk to me.

                          susan
                peter...

     susan pulls herself up.

                          susuan
                i'm really glad i'm not pregnant.

     reverse

     we look down past them as they climb.  two of the mimics and
     the albino have gotten into the shaft!

     the albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against
     opposite walls.

     susan and peter

     susan is crying, barely any strength left.

     peter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is
     barely hanging on himself.

     light hits them from the shaft above now, sounds of people
     talking and a muffled p.a. announcement filter down.

     mimics

     rushing upward on the shaft wall, higher, higher.
