               ext. cuban road - the jeep - day

               tearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful 
               expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across. it's a section of 
               guantanamo bay.

                         we'll just hop on the ferry and be 
                         over there in no time.

                                     kaffee
                              (shouting)
                         whoa! hold it! we gotta take a boat?!

                                     howard
                         yes sir, to get to the other side of 
                         the bay.

                                     kaffee
                         nobody said anything about a boat.

                                     howard
                              (shouting)
                         is there a problem, sir?

                                     kaffee
                              (shouting)
                         no. no problem. i'm just not that 
                         crazy about boats, that's all.

                                     jo
                              (shouting)
                         jesus christ, kaffee, you're in the 
                         navy for cryin' out loud!

                                     kaffee
                              (shouting)
                         nobody likes her very much.

                                     howard
                              (shouting)
                         yes sir.

               the jeep drives on and we

                                                                    cut to:

                         pleased to meet you, commander.

                                     kaffee
                         sam weinberg. he has no responsibility 
                         here whatsoever.

                                     jessep
                         i've asked captain markinson and lt.  
                         kendrick to join us.

                                     markinson
                         lt. kaffee, i had the pleasure of 
                         seeing your father once. i was a 
                         teenager and he spoke at my high 
                         school.

               kaffee smiles and nods.

                                     jessep
                         lionel kaffee?

                                     kaffee
                         yes sir.

                                     jessep
                         well what do you know. son, this 
                         man's dad once made a lot of enemies 
                         down in your neck of the woods. 
                         jefferson vs. madison county school 
                         district. the folks down there said 
                         a little black girl couldn't go to 
                         an all white school, lionel kaffee 
                         said we'll just see about that. how 
                         the hell is your dad?

                                     kaffee
                         he passed away seven years ago, 
                         colonel.

                                     jessep
                              (pause)
                         well... don't i feel like the fuckin, 
                         asshole.

                                     kaffee
                         not at all, sir.

                                     jessep
                         well, what can we do for you, danny.

                                     kaffee
                         not much at all, sir, i'm afraid. 
                         this is really a formality more than 
                         anything else. the jag corps insists 
                         that i interview all the relevant 
                         witnesses.

                                     jo
                         the jag corps can be demanding that 
                         way.

               jessep smiles.

                                     jessep
                         jonanthan'll take you out and show 
                         you what you wanna see, then we can 
                         all hook up for lunch, how does that 
                         sound?

                                     kaffee
                         fine, sir.

                                                                    cut to:
