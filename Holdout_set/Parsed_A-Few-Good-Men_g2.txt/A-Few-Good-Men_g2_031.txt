               ext. kaffee's apartment - day

               a little one-bedroom. just the essential furniture, barely 
               even that.

               kaffee's sitting and watching a baseball came on t.v. he's 
               holding a copy of the baseball encyclopedia, normally his 
               favorite reading material, but right now he's having trouble 
               keeping his mind in it. he's holding a baseball bat and 
               fiddling with it.

               the remnants of a pizza and yoo-hoo dinner sit next to him.  
               his white uniform in a pile in the corner. there's a buzz at 
               the door. kaffee's not expecting anyone. he goes to the door.

                                     kaffee
                         who is it?

                                     jo (o.s.)
                         it's me.

               kaffee opens the door and jo walks in.

                                     kaffee
                         i've really missed you, jo. i was 
                         just saying to myself, "it's been 
                         almost three hours since i last saw --
                         "

                                     jo
                         markinson resigned his commission.

                                     kaffee
                              (pause)
                         when?

                                     jo
                         this afternoon. sometime after we 
                         left.

                                     kaffee
                         i'll talk to him in the morning.

                                     jo
                         i already tried, i can't find him.

                                     kaffee
                         you tried? joanne, you're coming 
                         dangerously close to the textbook 
                         definition of interfering with a 
                         government investigation.

               jo hands kaffee the file she's been holding.

                                     jo
                         i'm louden downey's attorney.

               kaffee's stunned. he opens the file and begins to read.

                                     jo
                              (continuing)
                         aunt ginny. she said she feels like 
                         she's known me for years. i suggested 
                         that she might feel more comfortable 
                         if i were directly involved with the 
                         case. she had louden sign the papers 
                         about an hour ago.

               kaffee looks up. still too stunned to say anything. then 
               finally...

                                     kaffee
                         i suppose it's way too much to hope 
                         that you're just making this up to 
                         bother me.

                                     jo
                         don't worry, i'm not gonna make a 
                         motion for separation, you're still 
                         lead counsel.

               kaffee hands her back the file.

                                     kaffee
                         splendid.

                                     jo
                         i think kendrick ordered the code 
                         red.
                              (beat)
                         so do you.

                                                                    cut to:
