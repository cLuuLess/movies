               int. kaffee's apartment - night

               among the stuff, is a blackboard that's been hung on the 
               wall. written across the top are three headings:

                    intent             code red             the order

               sam is on the floor, sorting papers into piles. kaffee comes 
               in from the kitchen with a fresh bottle of yoo-hoo and joins 
               sam on the floor.

                                     kaffee
                         were you able to speak to your friend 
                         at nis?

                                     sam
                         she said if markinson doesn't want 
                         to be found, we're not gonna find 
                         him. she said i could be markinson 
                         and you wouldn't know it.

                                     kaffee
                         are you markinson?

                                     sam
                         no.

                                     kaffee
                         well, i'm not markinson, that's two 
                         down.

               sam doesn't laugh.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         what.

                                     sam
                              (pause)
                         i was wondering, now that joanne's 
                         working on this... i was wondering 
                         if you still need me.

                                     kaffee
                              (pause)
                         they were following an order, sam.

                                     sam
                         an illegal order.

                                     kaffee
                         you think dawson and downey know it 
                         was an illegal order?

                                     sam
                         it doesn't matter if they know, any 
                         decent human being would've refused 
                         to --

                                     kaffee
                         they're not permitted to question 
                         orders.

                                     sam
                         then what's the secret? what are the 
                         magic words? i give orders every 
                         day, and nobody follows them.

                                     kaffee
                         we have softball games and marching 
                         bands. they work at a place where 
                         you have to wear camouflage or you 
                         might get shot.

               sam looks away. he doesn't buy it.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing; pause)
                         i need you. you're better at research 
                         than i am and you know how to prepare 
                         a witness.

               jo lets herself in. she's carrying a huge stack of papers 
               under one arm, and a large brown paper bag under the other.  
               but we stay with kaffee and sam a moment longer.

                                     jo
                         i've got medical reports and chinese 
                         food. i say we eat first.

               kaffee's still looking at sam. sam nods his head.

                                     sam
                         did you get any dumplings?

                                                                    cut to:
