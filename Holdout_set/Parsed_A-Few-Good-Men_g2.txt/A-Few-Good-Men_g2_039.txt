               int. the courtroom - day

               dawson and downey are at the defense table, ross is his place. 
               kaffee walks in and joins jo and sam at their table. papers 
               are being passed back and forth between ross and the sergeant 
               at ams. quiet activity.

               the door in the back of the courtroom opens and randolph, a 
               marine colonel, enters and takes his place at the bench. we 
               can hear the band in the background.

                                     sergeant at arms
                         all rise.

               everyone present in the courtroom stands.

                                     randolph
                         where are we?

                                     sergeant at arms
                         docket number 411275. vr-5. united 
                         states versus lance corporal harold 
                         w. dawson and private first class 
                         loudon downey. defendants are charged 
                         with conspiracy to commit murder, 
                         murder in the first degree, and 
                         conduct unbecoming a united states 
                         marine.

                                     randolph
                         does defense wish to enter a plea?

               kaffee stands.

                                     kaffee
                         yeah.
                              (pause)
                         they're not guilty.

               jo, sam, ross, randolph... it's hard to say who's the most 
               surprised. it takes everything jo's got to suppress a smile. 
               the silence is broken by ross, who takes the two files, drops 
               them into his briefcase, closes the lid, and snaps it shut.

               randolph looks at kaffee and ross, then turns to the sergeant 
               at arms.

                                     randolph
                         enter a plea of not guilty for the 
                         defendants. we'll adjourn until ten- 
                         hundred, three weeks from today, at 
                         which time this court will reconvene 
                         as a general court-martial.

               he raps the gavel.

               randolph walks out. ross walks up the aisle without a word 
               to anyone. the m.p.'s come to escort dawson and downey back 
               to their cell.

               kaffee and jo and sam are the only ones remaining. sam is 
               looking at kaffee with question marks in his eyes.

                                     kaffee
                         why does a junior grade with six 
                         months experience and a track record 
                         for plea bargaining get assigned a 
                         murder case?
                              (beat)
                         would it be so that it never sees 
                         the inside of a courtroom?

               kaffee picks up his briefcase and begins heading toward the 
               door.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         we'll work out of my apartment.  
                         every night, seven o'clock. jo, before 
                         you come over tonight, pick up a 
                         carton of legal pads, a half-dozen 
                         boxes of red pens, a half-dozen boxes 
                         of black pens. sam get a couple of 
                         desk lamps. i need you to start on a 
                         preliminary medical profile and jo, 
                         we need all the fitness reports on 
                         dawson, downey and santiago. the 
                         only thing i have to eat is yoo-hoo 
                         and sugarsnacks, so if you want 
                         anything else, bring it with you. 
                         okay?

               jo's still stunned.

                                     jo
                         yeah.

               kaffee's at the door, stops, turns around, and takes it all 
               in for a moment.

                                     kaffee
                         so this is what a courtroom looks 
                         like.

               he walks out the door, and we

                                                                    cut to:
