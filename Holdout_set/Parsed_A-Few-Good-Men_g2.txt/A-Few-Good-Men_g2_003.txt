               int. santiago's room - night

               willy santiago, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in 
               his bunk.

               dawson kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on santiago's 
               shoulder and shakes him gently. santiago opens his yes, looks 
               at dawson, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

               -- and then santiago's eyes fill with terror. he lunges out 
               of the bed -- but forget about it. in one flash dawson and 
               downey grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come 
               out, downey's shoved a piece of cloth into santiago's mouth.

               everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision 
               and professionalism.

               -- a strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto 
               his mouth and eyes --

               -- a length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.

                                     downey
                              (quietly)
                         you're lucky it's us, willy.

               -- an arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking 
               him, just holding his head still --

               -- the drum cadence has built to a crescendo. we hear four 
               sharp blasts from a whistle and we

                                                              smash cut to:
