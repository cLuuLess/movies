               ext. a motel - night

               a sedan, with u.s. marshall stenciled on the door, sits in 
               front of one of the rooms, and the two federal agents inside 
               the car are reading the newspaper as kaffee's car pulls next 
               to them and kaffee jumps out.

               agent #1 sticks his head out the window and calls to kaffee --

                                     agent #1
                         workin' late, lieutenant?

               kaffee pays no attention and bangs on markinson's door. the 
               door opens and kaffee walks into
