               int. markinson's room - day

               markinson is writing a letter and we hear it in v.o.

                                     markinson (v.o.)
                         i was william's company commander.  
                         i knew your son vaguely, which is to 
                         say i knew his name...

               and while we continue to hear markinson's voice writing the 
               letter, we begin a series of shots: markinson is getting 
               into his class a dress uniform, complete with medals, side 
               arm, and military dress sabre.

                                     markinson (v.o.)
                         in a matter of time, the trial of 
                         the two man charged with your son's 
                         death will be concluded, and seven 
                         men and two women whom you've never 
                         met will try to offer you an 
                         explanation as to why william is 
                         dead. for my part, i've done as much 
                         as i can to bring the truth to light.

               markinson is finished dressing. he stands in the middle of 
               the motel room.

                                     markinson (v.o.)
                              (continuing)
                         and the truth is this: your son is 
                         dead for only one reason. i wasn't 
                         strong enough to stop it.

               markinson takes a pistol out of his holster and cocks the 
               trigger.

                                     markinson (v.o.)
                         always, captain matthew andrew 
                         markinson.

               markinson puts the pistol in his mouth --

                         united states marine corps.

               we hear the blast of the gunshot as we

                                                                    cut to:
