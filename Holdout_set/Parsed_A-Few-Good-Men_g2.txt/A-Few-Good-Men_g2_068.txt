                                     kaffee
                         private, i want you to tell us one 
                         last time: why did you go into private 
                         santiago's room on the night of august 
                         6th?

                                     downey
                         a code red was ordered by my platoon 
                         commander, lt. jonathan james 
                         kendrick.

                                     kaffee
                         thank you.
                              (to ross)
                         your witness.

                         private, for the week of 2 august, 
                         the switch log has you down at post 
                         39, is that correct?

                                     downey
                         i'm sure it is, sir, they keep that 
                         log pretty good.

                                     ross
                         how far is it from post 39 to the 
                         windward barracks?

                                     downey
                         it's a ways, sir, it's a hike.

                                     ross
                         about how far by jeep?

                                     downey
                         about ten, fifteen minutes, sir.

                                     ross
                         have you ever had to walk it?

                                     downey
                         yes sir. that day, sir. friday. the 
                         pick-up private -- sir, that's what 
                         we call the fella who drops us at 
                         our posts and picks us up... also, 
                         'cause he can get girls in new york 
                         city -- the pick-up private got a 
                         flat...

               at the defense table, kaffee, poker-faced, scribbles something 
               down on a piece of paper and slides it to jo. jo looks at 
               it:

               "where's he going with this?" jo scribbles "?" and hands it 
               back to kaffee.

                                     downey
                              (continuing)
                         ...right at 39. he pulled up and 
                         blam! ...a blowout-with no spare. 
                         the two of us had to double-time it 
                         back to the barracks.

                                     ross
                         and if it's ten or fifteen minutes 
                         by jeep, i'm guessing it must be a 
                         good hour by foot, am i right?

                                     downey
                         pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, 
                         sir.

                                     ross
                         not bad. now you say your assault on 
                         private santiago was the result of 
                         an order that lt. kendrick gave in 
                         your barracks room at 16:20.

               kaffee knows what's coming. there's nothing he can do about 
               it. and he can't lose his cool in front of the jury.

                                     downey
                         yes sir.

               jo. helpless. panicked.

                                     ross
                         but you just said that you didn't 
                         make it back to windward barracks 
                         until 16:45.

               downey's confused. these are questions he hasn't been asked 
               before.

                                     downey
                         sir?

                                     ross
                         if you didn't make it back to your 
                         barracks until 16:45, then how could 
                         you be in your room at 16:20?

                                     downey
                              (pause)
                         you see sir, there was a flat tire.

                                     ross
                         private, did you ever actually hear 
                         lt. kendrick order a code red?

               kaffee's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing 
               he can do about it. and he knows it.

                                     downey
                              (pause)
                         no, sir.

               jo leaps to her feet.

                                     jo
                         please the court, i'd like to request 
                         a recess in order to confer with my 
                         client.

                                     ross
                         why did you go into santiago's room?

                                     jo
                         the witness has rights.

                                     ross
                         the witness has been read his rights, 
                         commander.

                                     downey
                              (confused)
                         hal?

                                     randolph
                         the question will be repeated.

                                     ross
                         why did you go into santiago's room?

                                     jo
                         your honor --

                                     downey
                         hal?

                                     ross
                         did corporal dawson tell you to do 
                         it?

               everyone is frozen.

                                     ross
                              (continuing)
                         he did, didn't he? dawson told you 
                         to give santiago a code red.

               downey looks at dawson.

                                     downey
                         hal?

                                     ross
                         don't look at him.

                                     downey
                         hal?

                                     dawson
                         private. answer the lieutenant's 
                         question.

               the room is still silent. downey does something we've never 
               seen him do before. he straightens himself up and says this 
               with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right 
               thing.

                                     downey
                         yes, lieutenant. i was given an order 
                         by my squad leader, lance corporal 
                         harold w. dawson of the u.s. marine 
                         corps. and i followed it.

               ross let's it hang. he looks over at kaffee. kaffee won't 
               meet his eyes.
