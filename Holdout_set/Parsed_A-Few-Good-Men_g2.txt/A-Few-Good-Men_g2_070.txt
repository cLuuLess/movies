               ext. a suburban street - night

               jo is walking through the night at a brisk pace. she's doing 
               her best not to fall apart.

               two headlights appear coming down the street, and kaffee's 
               car, with sam driving and kaffee riding shotgun, slows down 
               alongside jo. kaffee rolls down his window.

                                     kaffee
                         joanne.

               jo ignores them and keeps walking. the car crawls along with 
               her.

               jo starts walking faster.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         jo, we look ridiculous.
                              (to sam)
                         stop the car.

               kaffee hops out and calls --

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         joanne.

               jo keeps walking.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         i apologize. i was angry and... i'm 
                         sorry about what i said.

               but jo's still walking.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing; calling)
                         i'm gonna put jessep on the stand.

               she stops. she turns around.

                                                                    cut to:
