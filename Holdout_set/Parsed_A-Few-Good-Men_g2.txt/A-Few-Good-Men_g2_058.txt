               int. a washington saloon - night

               a waitress sets two drinks down in front of kaffee and ross, 
               who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the 
               back.

                                     ross
                         that was nice work today. the redirect 
                         on howard.

                                     kaffee
                         i have markinson.

               ross only takes a moment digest this.

                                     ross
                         where is he?

                                     kaffee
                         a motel room in arlington with 14 
                         federal marshals outside his door.  
                         take a sip of your drink.

                                     ross
                         damn.

                                     kaffee
                         the transfer order that parkinson 
                         signed is phoney. and jessep's 
                         statement that the six a.m. flight 
                         was the first available is a lie, 
                         we're checking the tower chief's 
                         log. but in the meantime i'm gonna 
                         put the apostle jon kendrick on the 
                         stand and see if we can't have a 
                         little fun.

               ross takes another sip of his drink, then lays it on the 
               line for kaffee..

                                     ross
                         i have an obligation to tell you 
                         that if you accuse kendrick or jessep 
                         of any crime without proper evidence, 
                         you'll be subject to court-martial 
                         for professional misconduct. and 
                         that's something that'll be stapled 
                         to every job application you ever 
                         fill out. markinson's not gonna hold 
                         up, he's a crazy man. i'm not saying 
                         this to intimidate you. i'm being 
                         your lawyer.

                                     kaffee
                         thanks, jack. and i wanna tell you 
                         that i think the whole fuckin' bunch 
                         of you are certifiably insane. and 
                         this code of honor of yours makes me 
                         wanna beat the shit outta something.

                                     ross
                         don't you dare lump me in with jessep 
                         and markinson and kendrick because 
                         we wear the same uniform. i'm your 
                         friend, danny, and i'm telling you, 
                         i don't think your clients belong in 
                         jail. but i don't get to make that 
                         decision. i represent the government 
                         of the united states. without passion 
                         or prejudice. and my client has a 
                         case.
                              (pause)
                         i want you to acknowledge that the 
                         judge advocate has made you aware of 
                         the possible consequences involved 
                         in accusing a marine officer of a 
                         felony without proper evidence.

                                     kaffee
                         i've been so advised.

               ross stands up and heaves a few dollars on the table.

                                     ross
                         you got bullied into that courtroom, 
                         danny. by everyone. by dawson, by 
                         galloway, shit, i practically dared 
                         you. not for a second have you 
                         believed you could win. you got 
                         bullied into that room by the memory 
                         of a dead lawyer.

                                     kaffee
                              (pause)
                         you're a lousy softball player, jack.

                                     ross
                         your boys are going down. i can't 
                         stop it anymore.

                                                                    cut to:
