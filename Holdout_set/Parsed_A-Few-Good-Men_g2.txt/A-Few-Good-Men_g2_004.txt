               and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into semper 
               fidelis and it's coming from the u.s. marine corps band, a 
               sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished 
               silver and brass.

               the band is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds 
               before a crowd made up mostly of tourists and day-campers.

               as the titles roll, we watch the band do their thing from 
               various angles. incredible precision is the name of the game. 
               each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were 
               all attached by a rod. each drumstick raised to the same 
               fraction of a centimeter before striking. a rifle drill team 
               that can't possibly be human. flags, banners, the works.
