               int. sam's living room - night

               a baby sleeping in a crib pull rack to reveal sam is standing 
               over the crib. kaffee's sitting on a beer.

                                     sam
                         when nancy gets back, you're my 
                         witness. the baby spoke. my daughter 
                         said a word.

                                     kaffee
                         your daughter made a sound, sam, i'm 
                         not sure it was a word.

                                     sam
                         oh come on, it was a word.

                                     kaffee
                         okay.

                                     sam
                         you heard her. the girl sat here, 
                         pointed, and said "pa". she did. she 
                         said "pa".

                                     kaffee
                         she was pointing at a doorknob.

                                     sam
                         that's right. pointing, as if to 
                         say, "pa, look, a doorknob".

               sam joins kaffee in the living room.

                                     kaffee
                         jack ross came to see me today. he 
                         offered me twelve years.

                                     sam
                         that's what you wanted.

                                     kaffee
                         i know, and i'll... i guess, i mean --
                              (beat)
                         i'll take it.

                                     sam
                         so?

                                     kaffee
                         it took albout 45 seconds. he barely 
                         put up a fight.

                                     sam
                              (beat)
                         danny, take the twelve years, it's a 
                         gift.

               kaffee finishes off his beer, and stands.

                                     kaffee
                         you don't believe their story, do 
                         you? you think they ought to go to 
                         jail for the rest of their lives.

                                     sam
                         i believe every word they said. and 
                         i think they ought to go to jail for 
                         the rest of their lives.

               kaffee nods and puts down the empty beer bottle.

                                     kaffee
                         i'll see you tomorrow.

               sam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the 
               stoop for a moment.

                                     sam
                         remember to wear your whites, it's 
                         hot down there.

                                     kaffee
                         i don't like the whites.

                                     sam
                         nobody likes the whites, but we're 
                         going to cuba in august. you got 
                         dramamine?

                                     kaffee
                         dramamine keeps you cool?

                                     sam
                         dramamine keeps you from throwing 
                         up, you get sick when you fly.

                                     kaffee
                         i get sick when i fly because i'm 
                         afraid of crashing into a large 
                         mountain, i don't think dramamine'll 
                         help.

                                     sam
                         i've got some oregano, i hear that 
                         works pretty good.

                                     kaffee
                         yeah, right.

               kaffee starts toward his car, then turns around.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         you know, ross said the strangest 
                         thing to me right before i left. he 
                         said the platoon commander lieutenant 
                         jonathan kendrick had a meeting with 
                         the men and specifically told them 
                         not to touch santiago.

                                     sam
                         so?

                                     kaffee
                         i never mentioned kendrick. i don't 
                         even know who he is.
                              (beat)
                         what the hell.
                              (beat)
                         i'll see you tomorrow.

               we hold for a moment on kaffee as he walks to his car, then

                                                                    cut to:
