               int. the courtroom - day

               commander stone, a navy doctor in his mid-40's, is on the 
               stand.

                                     stone
                         ...and he was pronounced dead at 
                         zero-zero-thirty-seven.

                         dr. stone, what's lactic acidosis?

                                     stone
                         if the muscles and other cells of 
                         the body burn sugar instead of oxygen, 
                         lactic acid is produced. that lactic 
                         acid is what caused santiago's lungs 
                         to bleed.

                                     ross
                         how long does it take for the muscles 
                         and other cells to begin burning 
                         oxygen instead of sugar?

                                     stone
                         twenty to thirty minutes.

                                     ross
                         and what caused santiago's muscles 
                         and other cells to start burning 
                         sugar?

                                     stone
                         an ingested poison of some kind.

                                     kaffee
                         your honor, we object at this point. 
                         the witness is speculating.

                                     ross
                         commander stone is an expert medical 
                         witness, in this courtroom his opinion 
                         isn't considered speculation.

                                     kaffee
                         commander stone is an internist, not 
                         a criminologist, and the medical 
                         facts here are ultimately 
                         inconclusive.

                                     randolph
                         a point which i'm confident you'll 
                         illustrate to the jury under cross- 
                         examination, so i'm sure you won't 
                         mind if his opinion is admitted now.

                                     kaffee
                         not at all, sir. objection withdrawn.

               kaffee sits.

                                     ross
                         doctor stone, did willy santiago die 
                         of poisoning?

                                     stone
                         absolutely.

                                     ross
                         are you aware that the lab report 
                         and the coroners report showed no 
                         traces of poison?

                                     stone
                         yes i am.

                                     ross
                         then how do you justify --

                                     stone
                         there are literally dozens of toxins 
                         which are virtually undetectable, 
                         both in the human body and on a 
                         fabric. the nature of the acidosis 
                         is the compelling factor in this 
                         issue.

                                     ross
                         thank you, sir.

               kaffee gets up.

                                     kaffee
                         commander, you testified that it 
                         takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes 
                         before it becomes lethal.

                                     stone
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         let me ask you, is it possible for a 
                         person to have an affliction, some 
                         sort of condition, which might, in 
                         the case of this person, actually 
                         speed up the process of acidosis 
                         dramatically?

               stone says nothing for a moment.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         commander, is it possible?

                                     stone
                         certainly.

                                     kaffee
                         what might some of those conditions 
                         be?

                                     stone
                              (beat)
                         if a person had a coronary disorder... 
                         or a cerebral disorder, the process 
                         would be more rapid.

                                     kaffee
                         commander, if i had a coronary 
                         condition, and a perfectly clean rag 
                         was placed in my mouth, and the rag 
                         was accidentally pushed too far down, 
                         is it possible that my cells would 
                         continue burning sugar after the rag 
                         was taken out?

                                     stone
                         it would have to be a very serious 
                         condition.

                                     kaffee
                         is it possible to have a serious 
                         coronary condition, where the initial 
                         warning signals were so mild as to 
                         escape a physician during a routine 
                         medical exam?

                                     stone
                         possibly. there would still be 
                         symptoms though.

                                     kaffee
                         what kind of symptoms?

                                     stone
                         there are hundreds of symptoms of a --

                                     stone
                              (beat)
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         shortness of breath?

                                     stone
                         yes.

                                     kaffee

                         commander, isn't it possible that 
                         santiago had a serious coronary 
                         condition, and it was that condition, 
                         and not some mysterious poison, that 
                         caused the accelerated chemical 
                         reaction?

                         no. i personally give the men a 
                         physical examination every three 
                         months. and every three months private
