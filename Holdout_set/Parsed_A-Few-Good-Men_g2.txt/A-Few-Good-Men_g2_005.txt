               ext. a red brick building - day

               it's an important building, a main building. a few sailors 
               enter and exit and

                                                                    cut to:

               a woman

               as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building.  
               the woman is joanne galloway, a navy lawyer in her early 
               30's. she's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency 
               to speak quickly. if she had any friends, they'd call her 
               jo. as she walks, she mutters to herself ...

                                     jo
                         i'm requesting... i'm... captain, 
                         i'd like to request that i be the 
                         attorney assigned to rep -- i'd like 
                         to request that it be myself who is 
                         assigned to represent --
                              (she stops)
                         "that it be myself who is assigned 
                         to represent"? ...good, jo, that's 
                         confidence inspiring.

               we follow jo, still muttering, as she walks into the brick 
               building which bears the seal of the

               united states navy - judge advocate general's corps

                                                                    cut to:
