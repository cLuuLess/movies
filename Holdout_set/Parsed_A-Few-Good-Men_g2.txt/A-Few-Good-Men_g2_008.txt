               int. conference room - day

               about 16 navy and marine lawyers (several of whom are women) 
               are taking their seats around a large conference table.

               a paralegal is handing out folders and some photocopied papers 
               to the lawyers.

               we might notice that one of the lawyers is lieutenant junior 
               grade sam weinberg. sam's serious and studious looking. if 
               he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval 
               officer.

               captain whitaker walks in.

                                     whitaker

                              (school class)
                         'morning captain whitaker.

                                     whitaker
                         sam, how's the baby?

                                     sam
                         i think she's ready to say her first 
                         word any day now.

                                     whitaker
                         how can you tell?

                                     sam
                         she just looks like she has something 
                         to say.

               kaffee walks in.

                                     kaffee
                         excuse me, sorry i'm late.

                                     whitaker
                         i'm sure you don't have a good excuse, 
                         so i won't force you to come up with 
                         a bad one.

                                     kaffee
                         thank you, isaac, that's nice of 
                         you.

                                     whitaker
                         sit-down, this first one's for you.

               he hands kaffee some files.

                                     whitaker
                              (continuing)

               "oooh"'s and "ahhh"'s from the other lawyers. (subtle note: 
               kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world.)

                                     kaffee
                         requested to do what?
