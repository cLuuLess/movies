               he tosses the log book on the table.

                                     kaffee
                         there was no flight out at eleven 
                         o'clock. what the fuck are you trying 
                         to pull?

                                     markinson
                         the first flight stateside left 
                         guantanamo bay at eleven and arrived 
                         at andrews airforce base, maryland, 
                         at a few minutes past two.

                                     kaffee
                         then why the hell isn't it listed in 
                         the tower chief's log?!

                                     markinson
                         why the hell did you think it would 
                         be?!!

               kaffee is silent. and now it begins to sink in.

                                     kaffee
                         what are you telling me?
                              (beat)
                         he fixed the log book?

               setback. big setback.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         well, maybe he can make it so a plane 
                         didn't take off, but i can sure as 
                         hall prove that one landed. i'll get 
                         the log book from andrews.

               markinson says nothing. but his face says that kaffee was 
               born yesterday.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing; beat)
                         he made an entire flight disappear?

                                     markinson
                         nathan jessep is about to be named 
                         director of operations for the 
                         national security council. you don't 
                         get to that position without knowing 
                         how to side-step a few land mines.
                              (beat)
                         and putting me on the stand isn't 
                         gonna make him step on one.

               kaffee stares at him.

               then shakes his head, sighs, and picks the log book up off 
               the table, and heads for the door.

                                     kaffee
                         you're taking the stand. thursday.

               kaffee leaves.

               hold on markinson.

                                                                    cut to:
