               jo walks up from behind the backstop.

                                     kaffee

                         help we can get.

                                     jo
                         no, thank you, i can't throw and 
                         catch things.

                                     kaffee
                         that's okay, neither can they.

                                     jo
                         i wanted to talk to you about corporal 
                         dawson and private downey.

                                     kaffee
                         say again?

                                     jo
                         dawson and downey.

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         those names sound like they should 
                         mean something to me, but i'm just 
                         not --

                                     jo
                         dawson! downey! your clients!

                                     kaffee
                         the cuba thing! yes! dawson and 
                         downey.
                              (beat)
                         right.
                              (pause)
                         i've done something wrong again, 
                         haven't i?

                                     jo
                         i was wondering why two guys have 
                         been in a jail cell since this morning 
                         while their lawyer is outside hitting 
                         a ball.

                                     kaffee
                         we need the practice.

                                     jo
                         that wasn't funny.

                                     kaffee
                         it was a little funny.

                                     jo
                         lieutenant, would you feel very 
                         insulted if i recommended to your 
                         supervisor that he assign different 
                         counsel?

                                     kaffee
                         why?

                                     jo
                         i don't think you're fit to handle 
                         this defense.

                                     kaffee
                         you don't even know me. ordinarily 
                         it takes someone hours to discover 
                         i'm not fit to handle a defense.

               jo just stares.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         oh come on, that was damn funny.

               jo moves close to kaffee to say this with a degree of 
               confidentiality.

                                     jo
                         i do know you. daniel allistair 
                         kaffee, born june 8th, 1964 at boston 
                         mercy hospital. your father's lionel 
                         kaffee, former navy judge advocate 
                         and attorney general, of the united 
                         states, died 1985. you went to harvard 
                         law on a navy scholarship, probably 
                         because that's what your father wanted 
                         you to do, and now you're just 
                         treading water for the three years 
                         you've gotta serve in the jag corps, 
                         just kinda layin' low til you can 
                         get out and get a real job. and if 
                         that's the situation, that's fine, i 
                         won't tell anyone. but my feeling is 
                         that if this case is handled in the 
                         same fast-food, slick-ass, persian 
                         bazaar manner with which you seem to 
                         handle everything else, something's 
                         gonna get missed. and i wouldn't be 
                         doing my job if i allowed dawson and 
                         downey to spend any more time in 
                         prison than absolutely necessary, 
                         because their attorney had pre-
                         determined the path of least 
                         resistance.

               kaffee can't help but be impressed by that speech.

                                     kaffee
                         wow.
                              (beat)
                         i'm sexually aroused, commander.

                                     jo
                         i don't think your clients murdered 
                         anybody.

                                     kaffee
                         what are you basing this on?

                                     jo
                         there was no intent.

                                     kaffee
                         the doctor's report says that santiago 
                         died of asphyxiation brought on by 
                         acute lactic acidosis, and that the 
                         nature of the acidosis strongly 
                         suggests poisoning.
                              (beat)
                         now, i don't know what any of that 
                         means, but it sounds pretty bad.

                                     jo
                         santiago died at one a.m. at three 
                         the doctor was unable to determine 
                         the cause of death, but two hours 
                         later he said it was poison.

                                     kaffee
                         oh, now i see what you're saying.  
                         it had to be professor plum in the 
                         library with the candlestick.

                                     jo
                         i'm gonna speak to your supervisor.

                                     kaffee
                         okay. you go straight up pennsylvania 
                         avenue. it's a big white house with 
                         pillars in front.

                                     jo
                         thank you.

                                     kaffee
                         i don't think you'll have much luck, 
                         though. i was assigned by division, 
                         remember? somebody over there thinks 
                         i'm a good lawyer. so while i 
                         appreciate your interest and admire 
                         your enthusiasm, i think i can pretty 
                         much handle things myself.

                                     jo
                         do you know what a code red is?

               kaffee doesn't, but he doesn't say anything.

                                     jo
                              (continuing)
                         what a pity.

                                                                    cut to:
