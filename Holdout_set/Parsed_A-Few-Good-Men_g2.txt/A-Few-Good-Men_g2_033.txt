               int. the gymnasium - night

               ross is playing a game of full-court basketball with some 
               other officers.

               a door at the far end of the court opens and kaffee and jo 
               walk in. they head down the sideline toward ross.

               kaffee shouts --

                                     kaffee
                         jack!

               but ross is into the game...

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         jack!!

                                     ross
                              (waving him off)
                         hang on...

                                     kaffee
                         they were given an order.

               ross stops cold and looks over at kaffee. the game flies by 
               him. he motions to the locker room door in the corner of the 
               gym and the three of them make their way to privacy.

                                     jo
                         how long have you known about the 
                         order?

                                     ross
                         i didn't --
                              (to kaffee)
                         who is this?

                                     kaffee
                         this is jo galloway she's downey's 
                         lawyer. she's very pleased to meet 
                         you.

                                     ross
                         what exactly are you accusing me of, 
                         commander?

                                     jo
                         i'm accusing you of --

               they're in the

               locker room - night

               and kaffee slams the door shut behind them.

                                     kaffee
                         jack didn't know about the order. 
                         because if he did and he hadn't told 
                         us, jack knows he'd be violating 
                         about 14 articles of the code of 
                         ethics. as it is, he's got enough to 
                         worry about. god forbid our clients 
                         decide to plead not guilty and testify 
                         for the record that they were given 
                         an order.

                                     ross
                         kendrick specifically told the men 
                         not to touch santiago.

                                     kaffee
                         that's right. and then he went into 
                         dawson and downey's room and 
                         specifically told them to give him a 
                         code red.

                                     ross
                         that's not what kendrick said.

                                     kaffee
                         kendrick's lying.

                                     ross
                         you have proof?

                                     kaffee
                         i have the defendants.

                                     ross
                         and i have 23 marines who aren't 
                         accused of murder and a lieutenant 
                         with four letters of commendation.

                                     kaffee
                         why did markinson resign his 
                         commission?

                                     ross
                         we'll never know.

                                     kaffee
                         you don't think i can subpoena 
                         markinson.

                                     ross
                         you can try, but you won't find him.  
                         you know what markinson did for the 
                         first 17 of his 21 years in the corps? 
                         counter intelligence. markinson's 
                         gone. there is no markinson.

               some of the wind has been taken out of kaffee's sails.

                                     ross
                              (continuing)
                         jessep's star is on the rise. 
                         division'll give me a lot of room to 
                         spare jessep and the corps any 
                         embarrassment.

                                     kaffee
                         how much room?

                                     ross
                         i'll knock it all down to assault. 
                         two years. they're home in six months.

                                     jo
                         no deal, we're going to a jury.

                                     kaffee
                         jo --

                                     ross
                         no you're not.

                                     jo
                         why not?

                                     ross
                         'cause you'll lose, and danny knows 
                         it. and he knows that if we go to 
                         court, i'll have to go all the way, 
                         they'll be charged with the whole 
                         truckload. murder, conspiracy, conduct 
                         unbecoming, and even though he's got 
                         me by the balls out here, dan knows 
                         that in a courtroom, he loses this 
                         case. danny's an awfully talented 
                         lawyer, and he's not about to send 
                         his clients go to jail for life when 
                         he knows they could be home in six 
                         months.

               this is now clear: ross is as good as kaffee.

                                     ross
                              (continuing)
                         that's the end of this negotiation. 
                         from this moment, we're on the record. 
                         i'll see tomorrow morning at the 
                         arraignment.

               ross turns and heads back to the gym as we

                                                                    cut to:
