               jo holds out her hand. kaffee shakes it. jo kisses him.

                                     jo
                         wear matching socks.

               jo splits off toward her building and kaffee keeps walking 
               toward the bleachers as we pull back to include the almost 
               empty parade grounds and pull back as to show the washington 
               navy yard and pull back and back and back and
