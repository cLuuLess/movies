               ext. softball field - day

               the right man for the job

               his name is lieutenant junior grade daniel allistair kaffee, 
               and it's almost impossible not to like him. at the moment 
               he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen lawyers who are spread 
               out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. the '27 
               yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own 
               against a group of, say, airforce dentists.

               kaffee's in his late 20's, 15 months out of harvard law 
               school, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous 
               spirit to drive it. he is, at this point in his life, 
               passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

                                     kaffee
                              (calling out to the 
                              team)
                         alright, let's get two!

               he smacks one to the second base. the ball bounces right 
               between his legs.

                                     second base
                         sorry!

                                     kaffee
                         nothing to be sorry about, sherby.  
                         just look the ball into your glove.

               he smacks one out to the same place. it bounces off the heel 
               of sherby's glove and into center field.

                                     second base (sherby)
                         sorry!

                                     kaffee
                         you gotta trust me, sherby. you keep 
                         your eyes open, your chances of 
                         catching the ball increase by a factor 
                         of ten.

               spradling, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, 
               walks up behind the backstop.

                                     spradling
                         kaffee!

                                     kaffee
                         let's try it again.

                                     spradling
                         kaffee!!

                                     kaffee
                              (turning)
                         dave. you seem upset and distraught.

                                     spradling
                         we were supposed to meet in your 
                         office 15 minutes ago to talk about 
                         the mcdermott case. you're stalling 
                         on this thing. now we got this done 
                         and i mean now, or no kidding, kaffee, 
                         i'll hang your boy from a fuckin' 
                         yardarm.

                                     kaffee
                         a yardarm?
                              (calling out)
                         sherby, does the navy still hang 
                         people from yardarms?

                                     sherby
                              (calling back)
                         i don't think so, danny.

                                     kaffee
                              (back to spradling)
                         dave, sherby doesn't think the navy 
                         hangs people from yardarms anymore.
                              (back to the field)
                         let's go, let's get two!

               he goes back to hitting fungoes.

                                     spradling
                         i'm gonna charge him with possession 
                         and being under the influence while 
                         on duty. plead guilty and i'll 
                         recommend 30 days in the brig with 
                         loss of rank and pay.

                                     kaffee
                         it was oregano, dave, it was ten 
                         dollars worth of oregano.

                                     spradling
                         yeah, well your client thought it 
                         was marijuana.

                                     kaffee
                         my client's a moron, that's not 
                         against the law.

               swapp! the third baseman takes one in the face.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         ow. that had to hurt.
                              (calling out)

                         lester. walk it off!

                                     spradling
                         i've got people to answer to just 
                         like you, i'm gonna charge him.

                                     kaffee
                         with what, possession of a condiment?

                                     spradling

                                     kaffee
                         dave, i've tried to help you out of 
                         this, but if you ask for tall time, 
                         i'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

                                     spradling
                         you won't got it.

                                     kaffee
                         i will get it. and if the mtd is 
                         denied, i'll file a motion in liminee 
                         seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling 
                         in advance, and after that i'm gonna 
                         file against pre-trial confinement, 
                         and you're gonna spend an entire 
                         summer going blind on paperwork 
                         because a signalman second class 
                         bought and smoked a dime bag of 
                         oregano.

                                     spradling

                                     spradling
                         i don't know why i'm agreeing to 
                         this.

                                     kaffee
                         'cause you have wisdom beyond your 
                         years. dave, can you play third base?
