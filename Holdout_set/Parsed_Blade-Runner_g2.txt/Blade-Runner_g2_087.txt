        int. tyrell den - night                                 87

        next to a tray of cookies and milk, sebastian sits pa-
        tiently with the "egg" in his lap.  as the door opens
        he gets to his feet expectantly.  it's styles, tyrell's
        bodyguard.  he could play the giant in jack and the
        beanstalk.

                                styles
                  okay, i'll take that now.

        sebastian would rather put it in the boss's hands, but
        styles takes it and is almost through the door when
        sebastian stops him.

                                sebastian
                  wait!

        he almost forgot.

                                sebastian
                  can't fly without the pilot.

        sebastian hands him a little box.  styles stuffs it in
        his pocket and shuts the door behind him.
