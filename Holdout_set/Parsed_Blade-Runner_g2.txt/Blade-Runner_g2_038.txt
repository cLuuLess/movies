        int. tunnel - night                                     38

        the moon is up there slicing through the trees, strobing
        over the hood of the car.  the road is getting steeper
        and the corners sharper.  rags of mist skim by as the
        dusenberg picks up speed.  it is becoming a riveting
        ride, but the passenger's mind moves elsewhere.
