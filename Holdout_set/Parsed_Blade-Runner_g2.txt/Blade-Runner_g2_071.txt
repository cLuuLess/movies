        int. deckard's apartment - bedroom - morning            71

        the bed looks like it was hit by a storm and deckard
        looks like something that was washed up in it.  he's
        spread out flat, face creased and puffed.

        his eyes squint open, but only for a moment.  his
        hands are more reliable.  they search over the bed,
        but find it bare.  he edges his head over the side,
        looking around for signs, but she's all gone.  he
        gets up in two stages, sits and then stands.  then
        sits again, resting his head in his hands.
