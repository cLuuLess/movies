        int. tyrell corporation - air-filtered corridor - day   33b

        they pass into a canopied, air-filtered corridor.
        deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking
        at the animals.  small northern animals in neat "en-
        vironmental" cages.  he looks at the rabbit, the raccoon
        and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops
        him.  the armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes
        off them.

                                rachael
                  you like our owl?

        deckard nods.  rachael claps her hands.  the owl opens
        its yellow eyes and blinks at them.

                                deckard
                  it's artificial?

                                rachael
                  of course not.

        hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards
        the exit without looking back.

        the exit is another tube.  just big enough for two.  no
        room for excess.  he tries to ignore her cool appraising
        stare.

                                rachael
                  you're in a very unique position,
                  mr. deckard.  you could affect the
                  future of this entire organization
                  according to how you work your
                  little test.

        deckard has nothing to say.

                                rachael
                  are you apprehensive?

                                deckard
                  why should i be?

                                rachael
                  for the responsibility of your
                  power.  being a police bureaucrat,
                  you've got more than your share.

        the door slides open.  deckard looks down at her.

                                deckard
                  you got it wrong, girl.  i work
                  with the bureau not for them.

        he lets it sink in.

                                deckard
                  my job isn't to detect
                  malfunctioning andies, it's to
                  eliminate them.  the more the
                  better.

        he walks out of the elevator first.
