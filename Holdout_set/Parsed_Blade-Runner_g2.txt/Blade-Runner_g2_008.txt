        ext. terminal - night                                   9

        deckard unlocks his car and gets in.  turns the ig-
        nition and hits a sensor.  the dash console glows
        and deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool
        things off.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  it was 97 degrees in the city and
                  no hope of improvement.  not bad
                  if you're a lizard.  but two hours
                  earlier i was drinking acquavit
                  with an eskimo lady in north east
                  alaska.  that's a tough change to
                  make.  it was so good, i didn't
                  want to leave, so i left a day
                  early.

        a little detached, deckard taps another sensor on the
        panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-
        sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and
        caller.  the last one is repeated five times.  deckard
        sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.

                                deckard
                  contact.  this is blade runner one
                  calling com-fast 27.

        the sound of a chime precedes the mechanical female
        voice that answers.

                                voice
                  blade runner one, stand by please.

        a pause.  followed by a husky male voice.

                                voice
                  deckard.

                                deckard
                  yah, gaff.

                                gaff (voice)
                  where the hell you been?

                                deckard
                  you know where i been.  i been on
                  vacation.

                                gaff
                  next time you go on vacation,
                  do me a favor, let us know where
                  it is.

                                deckard
                  what's up?

                                gaff
                  holden got hit.

        there is a pause.  that was bad news.

                                deckard
                  bad?

                                gaff
                  severed spine.  you'd better get
                  in here.  bryant's waiting for you.

                                deckard
                  i'll see you in a minute.

        the engine revs, the wipers rake two weeks of dust off
        the windshield and deckard jams out of the lot.
