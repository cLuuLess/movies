        int. sebastian's ambulance - night                      25

        it's an old panel job with ambulance siren and lights.
        the lettering on the side reads "j.r. sebastian -
        animoid express."  sebastian gets in, starts up the
        engine and suddenly realizes he's not alone.  it's a
        jolt that causes him to yelp.

        pris is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up
        with a yelp of her own.  they stare at one another for
        a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk-
        ing.

        but she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case.
        sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her
        and opens the door.

                                sebastian
                  hey!  you forgot your...

        he holds up the bag.  hesitantly she reaches for it.

                                sebastian
                  how come you were in my truck?

                                pris
                  i was tired and didn't have any
                  place to go.

        she stares at him, hand on her case, looking lost.
        sebastian isn't good at this, but he tries.

                                sebastian
                  you can get back in if you want...

        she can't make up her mind.

                                sebastian
                  don't worry, i won't hurt you.

        she gets in.  both of them are silent.  people are not
        sebastian's medium -- usually he's too shy, but this
        girl is shyer still, plus they're about the same age --
        it gives him courage.

                                sebastian
                  what's your name?

                                pris
                  pris.

                                sebastian
                  mine's j.f. sebastian.

                                pris
                  hi.

        so pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a
        while what comes next.

                                sebastian
                  oh!  where do you want to go?

        she shrugs.  that leaves him a lot of responsibility.
        he throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping.

                                sebastian
                  you want to go home?

                                pris
                  i don't have one.

                                sebastian
                  oh.

        what do you do with a teenage beauty who looks like
        she's lost out of some "welcome to sunny arizona"
        poster?

                                sebastian
                  where are your folks?

                                pris
                  they left.

                                sebastian
                  what about friends?

                                pris
                  i have some, but i have to find
                  out where they are staying.

        she leans forward and rests her elbows on the dash.
        her body would win prizes, from any angle.

                                sebastian
                  well, where should i take you?

        she looks at him,a shadow of enticement in her clear
        blue eyes.

                                pris
                  we scared each other pretty good
                  didn't we?

                                sebastian
                  we sure did.

        she giggles and laughs.

                                pris
                  i'm hungry, j.f.

                                sebastian
                  i've got stuff.  if you wanna go
                  to my place?

                                pris
                  i was hoping you'd say that.

        sebastian's face is normally on the grey side, but it
        just turned red.  he turns on the ignition and they
        pull away from the curb.
