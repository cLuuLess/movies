        ext. woods (montage) - day                              123

        deckard and rachael walking.  the land lays white and
        hushed before them.

        down an aisle of maples and beeches.  the frosty light
        slanting through the clean, hard limbs.

        the crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in
        spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.

        rachael stops and faces him.  her lips are parted, her
        warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  looking
        lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she
        stands in the crisp white snow looking at deckard.
        nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on
        knowing.
