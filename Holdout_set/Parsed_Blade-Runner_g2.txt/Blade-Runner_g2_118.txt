        int. tenth floor hall - night                           116

        he's backing deckard out the door.  deckard trips and
        falls.  there's fear on his face.  the strength is gone.
        something is starting to crack.

                                batty
                  what's wrong?  aren't you a lover
                  of faster, bigger and better?!

        deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.

                                batty
                  it's time to die.

        deckard throws the laser at him.  it misses.  batty
        throws his head back and laughs.  a one-eyed colossus
        about to eat the world.  suddenly he stops.  his eye
        moves over the wall.

                                batty
                  ah!

        he reaches out and pinches something.  his lips compress
        as he yanks it out of the wall.  it's a ten-penny nail.

        he holds it out to deckard and drops it.  deckard
        catches it.

                                batty
                  that's for you.

        one side of batty's face smiles savagely.

                                batty
                  stick it in your ear and push.
                  if that doesn't work, try the
                  eye.

        deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at
        his executioner.

                                batty
                  believe me, it'll be better
                  for you than what i'm about
                  to do.

        batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire
        his victim to more action.  it doesn't look like it.

                                batty
                  well?

        deckard springs to his feet and bolts.  but instead of
        going for the stairwell he turns in the first available
        door.
