        int. apartment above sebastian's apartment - late       48
        afternoon

        mary turns her head as pris comes in.  she's sitting in
        a chair.  the only piece of furniture in the room.
        it's broken and tilts at a funny angle.  she nods and
        pris nods back.

        batty is lying on his back, rolling his head slightly
        from side to side like he's soothing a stiff neck.

                                batty
                  what's going on down there?

                                pris
                  he's not ready yet.

                                batty
                  when?

                                pris
                  tomorrow, he says.

        batty nods he can't wait.  pris glances at mary and
        gives a frigid little smile.  pris backs out and closes
        the door behind her.  batty blows air through his
        nostrils.  like an animal.
