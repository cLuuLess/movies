        int. inner sanctum of dr. tyrell - day                  34

        the office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience
        reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like
        glimmers of gold in a darkened mine.  dr. tyrell is a
        fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained
        from steroids and surgery.  dapper and trim, he leans
        against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket
        watch.  the only sound is the insidious perking of coffee
        brewing in the background.

        tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  the door in front of
        deckard and rachael slides open.  they enter a vestibule
        and face another door, this one befitting the decor of
        the office, tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as
        they enter.

                                rachael
                  mr. deckard.  dr. eldon tyrell.

                                tyrell
                  how do you do, mr. deckard.  please
                  sit down.  would you care for a cup
                  of coffee?

                                deckard
                  thanks.

                                tyrell
                  black?

                                deckard
                  please.

        tyrell pours from an old time sylex into small china
        cups and hands one to deckard.  the congenial light in
        his eyes could almost pass for warmth -- dragon warmth.

                                tyrell
                  somehow, i didn't expect that the
                  man who did the dirty work would
                  be the man to do the technical
                  work.  here you are, mr. deckard.

        he hands deckard a cup of coffee.

                                tyrell
                  is this to be an empathy test?

                                deckard
                  yes.

                                tyrell
                  capillary dilation of the so-called
                  blush response?  plus fluctuation
                  of the pupil, plus involuntary
                  dilation of the iris?

        deckard nods.

                                tyrell
                  may i ask a personal question?

                                deckard
                  go ahead.

                                tyrell
                  have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake?

                                deckard
                  no.

                                tyrell
                  but in your profession that is a
                  risk.

                                deckard
                  nothing is infallible, but so far
                  the voight-kampff scale bas been
                  foolproof.

                                tyrell
                  like you said, mr. deckard, a
                  machine can be a hazard.  the
                  voight-kampff scale is a machine,
                  isn't it?

                                deckard
                  one that relies on human
                  interpretation.  where's the
                  subject?

                                tyrell
                  sitting next to you.

        deckard stares at rachael, then back at tyrell.  delighted,
        tyrell takes a cup of coffee.

        accepting the challenge, deckard opens his briefcase and
        starts fishing out the apparatus.

        the voight-kampff                                       35

        rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot
        with light, the pupil contracting.

                                deckard's voice
                  ready.

                                rachael
                  go ahead.

        in the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both
        gauges are at rest.  dr. tyrell stands silhouetted behind
        deckard, who sits in front of rachael, a pencil beam
        trained on her eye.  wire mesh discs are attached to her
        cheeks.

                                deckard
                  you're given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday.

        the needles in both gauges swing violently past green to
        red, then subside.

                                rachael
                  i wouldn't accept it.  also, i'd
                  report the person who gave it to
                  me to the police.

                                deckard
                  you have a little boy.  he shows
                  you his butterfly collection, plus
                  the killing jar.

        again the gauges register, but not so far.

                                rachael
                  i'd take him to the doctor.

                                deckard
                  you're watching t.v. and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on your
                  wrist.

                                rachael
                  i'd kill it.

        both needles go to red.  deckard makes a note, takes a
        sip of coffee and continues.

                                deckard
                  in a magazine you come across a
                  full-page photo of a nude girl.

                                rachael
                  is this testing whether i'm an
                  android or a lesbian?

                                deckard
                  you show the picture to your husband.
                  he likes it and hangs it on the wall.
                  the girl is lying on a bearskin rug.

                                rachel
                  i wouldn't let him.

                                deckard
                  why not?

                                rachael
                  i should be enough for him.

        deckard frowns, then smiles.  his smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around.

                                deckard
                  you become pregnant by a man who
                  runs off with your best friend,
                  and you decide to get an abortion.

                                rachael
                  i'd never get an abortion.

                                deckard
                  why not?

                                rachael
                  that would be murder, mr. deckard.

                                deckard
                  in your opinion.

                                rachael
                  it would be my child.

                                deckard
                  sounds like you speaks from
                  experience.

        he notes the needles.  one goes green and the other
        remains inert.

                                deckard
                  last question.  you're watching
                  an old movie.  it shows a banquet in
                  progress, the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters.

                                rachael
                  ugh.

        both needles swing swiftly.

                                deckard
                  the entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice.

        needles move less.

                                deckard
                  the raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog.

        deckard moves the adhesive discs from her cheeks and
        switches off his beam.

                                deckard
                  lights please.

        the lights come on.

                                tyrell
                  well?

                                deckard
                  if she is, the machine works.

                                tyrell
                  the machine works.  she is.

        rachael sits very still.  except her eyes -- they go to
        tyrell and hang on.  he stares back at her as he speaks.

                                tyrell
                  how many questions did it take?

                                deckard
                  thirteen.

        rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles
        around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with tyrell.
        his voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing.  she's hang-
        ing by a thread.

        deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.

                                deckard
                  she didn't know?

                                tyrell
                  memory implant.  she was programmed.
                  but i think she has transcended
                  her conditioning.  i think she was
                  beginning to suspect.

        rachael nods fixedly.  careful not to let go her grasp.

                                tyrell
                  how many questions does it usually
                  take, mr. deckard?

                                deckard
                  five, maybe six.

        slowly, carefully, tyrell unlocks his gaze from rachael
        and turns towards deckard, who is starting to put away
        his equipment.

                                tyrell
                  you're going to have to be on your
                  toes, my friend.

        deckard glances back at him.

                                tyrell
                  it's a complex problem and we
                  wouldn't want anything to happen
                  to you.

        less of a man might shrink at the end of deckard's look,
        but not tyrell.

                                tyrell
                  for the good of all, i recommend
                  you take rachael with you.
                  considering her uniqueness, i'm
                  sure she could prove quite helpful.

        deckard almost smiles at the nasty power of tyrell's
        style.  he turns away and starts packing up the voight-
        kampff.

                                deckard
                  no thanks.

        deckard is ready to go.

                                tyrell
                  and how is it one man will be able
                  to cover so much ground?

                                deckard
                  discreetly.

                                tyrell
                  all pertinent information is
                  being fed into your departmental
                  computer, an esper 231 -- i
                  believe -- and a photo over-lay
                  packet is being produced.

        deckard opens the door.

                                tyrell
                  mr. deckard, i think it would be
                  wise to reconsider my offer.

        rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her
        feet flat on the floor, alone is the word.

        trying to keep the fury out of it, deckard's voice
        comes out in a whisper.

                                deckard
                  i work alone.

        on the last word, rachael glances up at him and deckard
        turns away. the outer door slides open and he goes
        through it.
