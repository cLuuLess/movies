        ext. sebastian's apartment                              27

        a district of silence and ruin.  the street is strewn
        with refuse.  the building looks vacant.  a ten storey
        condo gone to shit.  the vandals have come and gone
        long ago.

        sebastian's little white ambulance parked at the curb.
        mr. deetchum, the old watchman, sitting in the building
        entry in a straight backed chair, is reading a comic
        book.
