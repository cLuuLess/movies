        int. tunnel - night                                     40

        the dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating
        up the road.  rushing the corners in gut wrenching four-
        wheel drifts.  not a pleasant sensation if you don't
        like roller-coasters.

        the dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple
        hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend.

        good place for a breather, but the driver shifts into
        high and screws on.
