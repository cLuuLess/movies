        int. taffey's office - night                            61

        taffey's what's referred to in the trade as a "chicken
        hawk" collector of young girls.

        it must be so, there's one in the bed.  thin, pale,
        about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her
        fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead,
        lying flat on her back in taffey's crowded little
        room.

        taffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow
        shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like
        a seal.  but at the moment he's not present.

        there's a knock at the door, then the sound of a toilet
        flushing.  taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart
        pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches
        the door like the guilty fucker he is.  he looks through
        the peeper.

        deckard is out there holding up his i.d.

                                deckard
                  taffey lewis?

                                taffey
                  yes?

                                deckard
                  can i come in?

        there is a pause lasting the time it takes taffey not
        to think of a way to say no.  the door opens and deckard
        enters.  except for the drool coming out of the corner of
        her mouth, and the fluttering eye-lids, venus doesn't
        move a muscle.

                                taffey
                  excuse my niece there... she's
                  studying for an exam.

        deckard takes the  identikit hard copies our of his
        pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them
        out on the table.

                                deckard
                  i'd like  you to take a look at
                  these pictures.

                                taffey
                  of course.

        taffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures
        from about two inches away.

                                taffey
                  you see i lost my contacts a
                  couple of days ago around here
                  somewhere and my sight is a
                  little... what am i supposed
                  to be looking for?

                                deckard
                  do you recognize any of
                  them?

        he stops at zhora.

                                taffey
                  this one looks familiar, but
                  i don't know.  naw.  there's
                  one came in today looks a
                  little like this one but...

                                deckard
                  what did she want?

                                taffey
                  who?

                                deckard
                  the girl that doesn't look
                  like that girl.

                                taffey
                  nothing.  she wanted to know
                  about suck night.

                                deckard
                  what night?

                                taffey
                  i didn't know if i wanted to
                  handle her -- i already got
                  a snake act.  but my partner
                  goes down there to the opera
                  house on suck night to book
                  the good ones.

                                deckard
                  what's suck night?

                                taffey
                  that's what we call in the
                  trade, audition free-for-
                  alls and most of it sucks.
                  bit i don't think that's
                  her.

                                deckard
                  you talking about the opera
                  house on the main?

        taffey nods.  deckard goes to the door and turns.

                                deckard
                  book the good ones for where?

                                taffey
                  lots of places.  the tours,
                  the clubs, the silicone shows,
                  private parties.

                                deckard
                  what shows?

                                taffey
                  silicone valley.  lots of
                  these science guys never
                  leave that place.  we book
                  two shows a month in there.
                  those big time techs and bio-
                  guys might be real high zoners
                  up here, but when it comes
                  to the arts, they like it loud
                  and lewd.

        it's starting to get a little gooey.  deckard tips his
        head good night and backs out of the door.
