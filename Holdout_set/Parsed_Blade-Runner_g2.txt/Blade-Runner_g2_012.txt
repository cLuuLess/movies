        int. leon's hotel lobby - night                         13

        a heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron
        balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;
        mato grosso indians in white man's clothes and other
        lower echelon welfare recipients.  drop city is crowded,
        cramped and darkly alive.

        deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the
        crowd.  a cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating
        as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of
        stairs under a neon sign that says bath house.

        a musty subterranean wind ripples deckard's clothes as
        he turns into an alcove.  he stops in front of a door
        that says, manager and pushes the buzzer.  it's opened
        by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to
        his hip.  deckard flashes his id and speaks some words
        which are inaudible due to the tuba music down the hall.
        the man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and
        shuts the door.
