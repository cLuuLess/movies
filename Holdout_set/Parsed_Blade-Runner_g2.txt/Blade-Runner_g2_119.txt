        provocation accomplished. batty smiles and walks lei-
        surely towards the door.  deckard's terrified scream
        and the sound of glass crashing stop him.  batty speeds
        up and moves into the room.

        the window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out,
        bellowing in the wind.

                                batty
                  crap.

        he walks up to the window.  deckard comes away from the
        wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed
        at the base of batty's skull.  batty starts to lean
        over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he
        knows.  he spins...

        deckard fires again.  this one goes home.  batty falls
        like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.

        deckard starts to tremble.  his arms go limp as his
        head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  he can breathe
        again.
        
        on the floor, batty's hand is crawling toward deckard's
        ankle.

        with the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
        banana peel, deckard comes down.  face knotted in hor-
        ror, he empties the laser in batty's body -- but the
        hand holds on.  with a screech of frustration he drops
        the laser and like an animal claws at batty's dead
        fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.

        deckard starts to crawl, pulling batty behind him.  he
        struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.
