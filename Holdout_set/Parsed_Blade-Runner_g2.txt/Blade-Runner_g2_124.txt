        deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  he
        and rachael in the front seat.  except for the occasion-
        al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold
        shine of an icy dream.

        the clouds overhead are soft and swift.

                  she wanted to go to a place i knew.
                  out of the city.  like one of those
                  pictures she saw.  where there were
                  trees but no buildings.

        rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream
        by.

                  we had a good time.  she told me a
                  funny story and i taught her a
                  song.  a song about monkeys and
                  elephants.  and it made us laugh so
                  hard we couldn't sing.
