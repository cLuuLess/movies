        int. deckard's bedroom - day                            79

        they're under the sheet.  rachael is on her back, look-
        ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over
        the pillow.  deckard lies next to her, a man studying
        a treasure.

                                rachael
                  do you dream?

                                deckard
                  yeah.  sometimes.

                                rachael
                  i wish i could.

        his hand moves over her shoulder.

                                deckard
                  wishing is a kind of dreaming.

        his hand goes under the sheet.

                                rachael
                  i mean asleep.

        she feels good.  he moves closer.

                                rachael
                  did you cry when your father
                  died?

                                deckard
                  yeah.

                                rachael
                  that's another thing i can't
                  do.

        he kisses her lightly on the cheek.

                                rachael
                  nobody is freer than when he
                  dreams.  i read that.

                                deckard
                  it wasn't very good last night,
                  was it?

                                rachael
                  i don't know, i have nothing
                  to compare it to.  i guess i
                  thought there was something
                  more to it.

                                deckard
                  what?

                                rachael
                  i don't know... i think i missed
                  something.

                                deckard
                  like?

                                rachael
                  i'm not sure.  is there a
                  secret?

        her face is close.  she's looking right at him.  her
        lips are right there.

                                deckard
                  i don't know.  if there is i'd
                  like to find it.

        slowly their lips touch and his arms slide under her
        body.
