        ext. sebastian's building - dawn                        120

        slowly the door pushes open and deckard comes out into
        the morning.  the sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has
        begun to pale.  it's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not
        very pretty, but even though he can't show it, deckard
        is glad to see it.

        for a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
        breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the
        street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to
        fall.

        deckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  the col-
        lapses on the front seat.
