        int. deckard's apartment - night                        53

        he slips on the light and crosses the front room.
        deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved
        in or is just moving out.

        as he enters the kitchen, the sound of somebody behind
        him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out
        in front of him, gun already in it.  rachael almost got
        shot.  but she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but
        direct as ever.  there's a long, chilly moment, then
        she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the
        floor.

                                rachael
                  was that your dinner?

        deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods.

                                rachael
                  i'm sorry.  i called and found out
                  you were on your way home.  these
                  were already delivered to your
                  department but i thought you
                  should have copies as soon as
                  possible.

        she's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette
        pack.  but it's taking deckard's adrenalin time to
        recede.

                                rachael
                  it's the nexus information you
                  wanted.

        he takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks
        must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily.
        he doesn't even want to ask.

                                deckard
                  thanks.

        he realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and
        sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring
        at each other.  the situation makes awkward silence.
        at least for him.  she's looking at him like she's
        got something to say but isn't saying it.

                                deckard
                  is there anything else?

                                rachael
                  i know you think it complicates
                  your work, but i'm here to help.

                                deckard
                  i've already got more help than
                  i need.

                                rachael
                  i think you need more help than
                  you've got.

        he doesn't, but she's not backing off.

                                rachael
                  there's two reasons a man rejects
                  help.  either because he's so good
                  at what he does he doesn't think
                  he needs it, or he's so insecure
                  he can't admit it.

                                deckard
                  sounds like i'm an ass-hole either
                  way, but the answer is still no.

                                rachael
                  two of us might be more effective
                  than one.

                                deckard
                  i work alone.

        she smiles.

                                rachael
                  no you don't.

        she lets it sink in.

                                rachael
                  you use your equipment, don't you?

                                deckard
                  so?

                                rachael
                  so, i'm a piece of equipment.
                  use me.

        it's a strong look that passes between them -- a long
        one.  maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do
        something about such an offer but...

        deckard's eyes follow her down as rachael bends to
        the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put-
        ting it back on the plate.

                                deckard
                  that's okay, i'll get it...

        he bends down to help, but she's already done it.
        their heads a few inches apart.  something in her eyes
        diminishes the distance even more.

                                rachael
                  do i make you nervous?

                                deckard
                  yeah.

                                rachael
                  i'm sorry.

        and she is.  and suddenly he is too.  she hands him the
        plate and they stand.  she's looking at the floor,
        almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her.
        she says it plain and simple.

                                rachael
                  it's strange to suddenly realize
                  that what you thought was your
                  life is actually someone else's
                  fabrication.

        deckard nods.  he feels it, but doesn't know what to
        do about it.

                                deckard
                  i can imagine.

                                rachael
                  can you?  i couldn't.

        these are not some of deckard's finer moments.  but she
        doesn't seem to notice.

                                rachael
                  a part of me is glad.  i think i
                  feel more.  i don't like who i was
                  before.

        deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is
        glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen.

        in the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen deckard looks
        around for a place to put the plate, but things have
        piled up on him in here.  he contemplates the refrig-
        erator.

                                deckard
                  so why do you think they were
                  after their records.

        he's a lot more comfortable talking shop.

                                rachael
                  they probably want to find out
                  when they were made.

                                deckard
                  right.

        he dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out.
        she's writing something on a card.

                                rachael
                  i guess the date of your birth is
                  important if you know you're not
                  made to last.

        no way he can keep his foot out of it.  she looks up and
        hands him the card.

                                rachael
                  that's my number.  if you need me.

        she goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before
        going through.

                                rachael
                  you better get better locks --
                  if you want to keep me out.

        she looks back at him and smiles -- the smile says
        she's talking about all kinds of locks.  deckard looks
        like he might ask her to stay, but...

                                rachael
                  good night.

        and she's gone.

                                deckard
                  night.

        he looks down at the number.  it's the back side of a
        snapshot.   he turns it over.  the picture of a man
        and a woman.  the little girl between them looks like
        a six-year old rachael.
