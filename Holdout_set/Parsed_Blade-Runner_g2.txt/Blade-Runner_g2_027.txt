        int. sebastian's apartment - night                      28

        well stocked with items of survival, all labeled and
        stacked.  and shelved along the walls and hung from the
        ceiling is a menagerie of animoids.  like so many broken
        toys awaiting resurrection from sebastian's wise hands.
        
        sebastian is seated at a large work-table, bent over a
        stereo scope.  the tool in his right hand is a sensor
        probe and he's using it with the delicacy of an en-
        graver.

        the object of his concentration is a maze-like chip
        configuration no bigger than a thumbnail, but magnified
        under the scope, it looks like an aerial view of a
        large city.  the needle-like sensor probe moves care-
        fully over the contours of the configuration, testing
        the bonds.

        suddenly a blue flash erupts from one of the junctures.

                                sebastian
                  oh!

        pris is light on her feet.  she's standing behind him
        with a half-eaten sandwich in her hand.

                                pris
                  whatcha doin'?

                                sebastian
                  you scared me.

        but he's happy to see her.

                                sebastian
                  i'm working.

        she's changed her dress and made up her face.  looks a
        little older and sexier.

                                sebastian
                  you look... better.

                                pris
                  just better.

                                sebastian
                  beautiful.

                                pris
                  thanks.

        he watches her as she prowls around the room, looking
        at this and that, eating her sandwich.

                                pris
                  and you live in this building all
                  by yourself?

                                sebastian
                  yeah, i live here pretty much
                  alone right now...

        trying to make light of it.

                                sebastian
                  no housing shortage around here...
                  plenty of room for everybody.

        she sprawls on the couch studying him.

                                pris
                  how old are you?

        he can't meet her eyes.

                                sebastian
                  twenty.

                                pris
                  what's your problem?

        it's not an easy subject.  his voice is barely audible.

                                sebastian
                  methuselah syndrome.

                                pris
                  what's that?

                                sebastian
                  my glands.  they grow old too fast.

                                pris
                  is that why you're still here?

                                sebastian
                  yes.  i couldn't pass the test.

        there is a silence.  he steals a glance at her.

                                pris
                  i like you just the way you are.

        under the desk he bats his knees together.

                                sebastian
                  ah, you get hold of your friends?

                                pris
                  as a matter of fact i did.  they've
                  got some work to do tonight, but
                  they're gonna come tomorrow.

                                sebastian
                  good.

        the implications catch up.

                                sebastian
                  i can sleep on the couch.

        a little gray mouse on the shelf above his head bobs
        up.

                                mouse
                  don't let the bed bugs bite!

        taking their cue from the mouse, some of the more
        talented animoids toot, flap and wheel about.
