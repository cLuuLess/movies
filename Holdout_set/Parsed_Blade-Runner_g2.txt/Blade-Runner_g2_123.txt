        int. deckard's bedroom - dawn                           121

        in a corner of the dimness deckard sits slumped on a
        chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  the
        only sound in the room is the soft steady breathing
        that comes from the bed.

        quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  rachael lies
        sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet.

        deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down
        at her.

        moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of
        the bed.

        rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.
