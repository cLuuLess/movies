        deckard taking it down.  about to pull it in an already
        crowded lot, but the sign flashes "full."  deckard
        doesn't believe in signs; is about to set it down any-
        way when a chicano in a fluorescent coat runs out and
        waves him off.

                                deckard
                  fuck.

        pissed, deckard veers away and buzzes low over and
        around the roof tops, all dark and cramped -- not a
        lot of room around here.
