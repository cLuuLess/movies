        int. deckard's bedroom - night                          93

        books scattered on the bed.  rachael sitting cross-
        legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite
        shots of nature.  deckard is next to her, watching her
        like a lover, like a father.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  she'd never seen the great outdoors.
                  never even seen books on the
                  subject.  she went through
                  everything i had, and we talked.
                  and there were subjects we didn't
                  discuss and they were words we
                  didn't say, i couldn't say, like
                  death, like future, like real.  but
                  it was hard because she was curious
                  and full of questions.  she was
                  more alive than anyone i'd ever
                  known.

        she looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with
        no need to comment.  it's in her eyes.  she stares at
        him, a revelation taking shape.

                                rachael
                  you and i are good friends, huh?

        he considers it and she stares at him, smiling at the
        wonder of it.

                                rachael
                  it's so easy.

        convinced and not convinced, he nods his head.  she
        laughs at his solemnity.  she's irresistible.  deckard's
        pretty irresistible himself.

                                rachael
                  have you ever known anybody a long
                  time?

                                deckard
                  you mean a woman?

                                rachael
                  uh-huh.

                                deckard
                  what's a long time?

                                rachael
                  ten years.

                                deckard
                  nope.  nobody could stand me that
                  long.

        the chime on the phone next to the bed goes off.  he
        reaches out and brings it to his ear.

                                deckard
                  yeah.

                                bryant
                  this is bryant.  are you alone?

                                deckard
                  yeah.

                                bryant
                  she's not with you?

                                deckard
                  who.

        a pause.

                                bryant
                  take a number.  canapt 1700, tenth
                  floor, villa vita district, olympia
                  south.

                                deckard
                  got it.

                                bryant
                  okay, here it is.  eldon tyrell, his
                  family and half his staff were just
                  massacred.  the cat is about to get
                  out of the bag.  pressure is
                  definitely on.  the nexus program
                  is terminated.  when you finish
                  there, locate nexus designated rachael
                  and retire.

        deckard says nothing.

                                bryant
                  if you don't, we will.  it has to
                  be total, deckard.  that's an order
                  from as high as it comes.  got it?

                                deckard
                  yeah.  i got it.

                                bryant
                  go.

        he hangs up the receiver and gets up.  she watches him
        from the bed.  the gun goes into his belt.  he loads
        the ankle job and straps it on.  she watches every move.

                                rachael
                  why do you call it retire, why
                  don't you call it murder?

                                deckard
                  because it's not.

                                rachael
                  don't you think anything that can
                  suffer deserves to be considered?

                                deckard
                  andies only simulate suffering --
                  if they're programmed for it.

                                rachael
                  do you think i simulated what
                  happened between us?

                                deckard
                  no, i don't.

        without looking at her, he puts on his jacket.

        he's standing in the middle of the floor with his back
        to her.  he turns and they're facing one another.
        neither of them moves.

                                deckard
                  don't leave here.  don't open the
                  door, don't answer the phone.

                                rachael
                  what difference will it make?

                                deckard
                  just wait here.

        he goes to the door.

                                rachael
                  you know what i think?

                                deckard
                  what?

                                rachael
                  that some of the folks around here
                  are more programmed then me.

        he has to laugh.

                                rachael
                  you know what else i think?

                                decakrd
                  what?

                                rachael
                  this was the best day of my life.

        he turns and goes through the door.
