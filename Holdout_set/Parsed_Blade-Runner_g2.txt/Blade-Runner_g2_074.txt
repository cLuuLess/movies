        int. mr. deetchum's apartment - morning                 74

        the rooster perched on the chair spreading its scrawny
        wings, strains from the tips of its toes, crowing at
        the ceiling.  between crows there's a tapping at the
        door.

        you might call this a "barnyard" apartment.  there's
        straw on the floor and several hens roosting against
        the back wall.  the front door opens a few inches and
        sebastian pokes his head in.

                                sebastian
                  mr. deetchum?  hello?

        nobody seems to be home except his chickens.  as sebas-
        tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose
        charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking.

                                sebastian
                  now, now, waddles.

        seeming to recognize sebastian as no intruder, waddles
        veers off from the attack.  as sebastian crosses the
        room a pig peeks out from behind the couch.

                                sebastian
                  hello, wrigley.

        he goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting
        them into a bowl he's brought.  he puts down the bowl
        and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the
        payment and puts the money on a plate.  he's about to
        leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.

                                sebastian
                  mr. deetchum isn't taking very
                  good care of you people.

        pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser
        with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets
        his bowel of eggs and leaves.

        wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for
        a long drink.
