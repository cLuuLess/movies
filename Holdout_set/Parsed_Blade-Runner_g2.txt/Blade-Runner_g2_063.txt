        int. backstage - night                                  63

        to scattered applause, hoots and whistles, salome
        flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul-
        ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the
        narrow corridor to her dressing room.  she's about
        to enter when:

                                deckard
                  excuse me, miss salome.

        she turns.  deckard's posture and attitude suggest hum-
        ble, sleazy persistence.  he comes closer with his
        shit-eating grin.

                                deckard
                  i'd like to have a word with you
                  if i could.

        salome stands almost six feet high in her high heels
        -- she looks down on him with the haughty suspicion
        of a chick who knows how to handle cheap hits.

                                salome
                  yeah?

                                deckard
                  i'm with the american federation
                  of variety artists...

        he holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.

                                deckard
                  don't worry, i'm not here to make
                  you join -- that's not my department.

        he glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
        there.

                                deckard
                  i'm an investigator for the
                  confidential committee on moral
                  abuses.

        she nods, taking it a little more seriously.

                                deckard
                  there's been reports of management
                  sexually abusing the artists in
                  this place.

                                salome
                  i don't know nothing about it.

                                deckard
                  you haven't felt yourself to be
                  exploited by the management in any
                  way?

        she's definitely puzzled.

                                salome
                  how do you mean 'exploited'?

                                deckard
                  like to get this position.  did
                  you or were you asked to do anything
                  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
                  repulsive to your person?

                                salome
                  are you for real?

                                deckard
                  oh, yeah.
                  you'd be surprised what goes on
                  around here.  i'd like to check
                  the dressing room if i could.

                                salome
                  what the fuck for?

                                deckard
                  for holes.

        this guy might be an asshole but he's funny.

                                salome
                  i don't believe this.

        she shrugs and they go in.
