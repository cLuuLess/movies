        int. deckard's apartment bedroom - day                  81

        rachael is lying across the bed in one of deckard's
        shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around
        the room.  deckard lies next to her.  looking like a
        man who died a voluptuous death.

                                rachael
                  when was the last time you cleaned
                  this place?

                                deckard
                  hmmm?

                                rachael
                  have you ever cleaned your
                  apartment?

                                deckard
                  don't be fooled by appearances.

                                rachael
                  it appears to be dirty -- why don't
                  you get somebody?

        he rolls over to admire her legs.

                                deckard
                  because they would ruin the
                  arrangement.

        he kisses the back of her thigh.

                                rachael
                  they could clean around the
                  arrangement.

                                deckard
                  i don't like people snooping around
                  my stuff.

        he kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the
        bathroom.

                                deckard's voice
                  there's a vacuum in the front room
                  closet is you wanna give it a try.

        rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into
        the front room and opens the closet door.  the vacuum is
        not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out.  as
        she starts to plug it in --

                                deckard
                  oh no, don't do that.

        he's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway.

                                rachael
                  but if i don't plug it in how can
                  i...

                                deckard
                  never mind the plug, just go
                  through the motions.

                                rachael
                  but then how can you...

                                deckard
                  i don't like the noise.  just
                  practice.  practice makes perfect.

        she stares at him like he's nuts.

                                deckard
                  i'm serious.  go ahead.  show me
                  how you would do it.

        reluctantly she makes some half-hearted passes with the
        thing.

                                deckard
                  how about under the couch there.
                  come on.

        she bends over to get it.  deckard pulls up a chair and
        sits down with his chin in his hands.  she looks back
        at him.

                                rachael
                  this feels stupid.

                                deckard
                  good for a smart girl to feel
                  stupid.  part of your education.

        she drops the vacuum and sits on the floor.  deckard
        gets up and comes towards her.  her eyes travel halfway
        down his sheet and she leaves.

                                rachael
                  you're sick, deckard.

                                deckard
                  i never felt better.
