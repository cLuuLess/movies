        int. sebastian's apartment - day                        80

        batty, pris and mary sit at the table staring at their
        host.  sebastian is staring back, his fork halfway to
        his mouth, looking from face to face.  although nothing
        is being said, he's totally comfortable, as much at
        home with them as he is with his animoids.

                                batty
                  why are you staring at us?

                                sebastian
                  you're just all so... so different.

        batty nods his head, smiling, sending home the fact and
        sebastian is certainly getting it.

                                batty
                  what, sebastian?

                                sebastian
                  you're androids.

        a long pause.

                                pris
                  what makes you think so?

                                sebastian
                  you're all so perfect.

        sebastian is smiling from ear to ear.

                                sebastian
                  what generation are you?

                                batty
                  nexus - 6.
        
        sebastian whistles.  mary's head is shaking slightly.
        pris gets up and moves to the couch.  batty couldn't
        be more pleased.

                                batty
                  we can trust sebastian, ladies.
                  he's been working with mechanisms
                  all his life.  he's a wizard and
                  a very perceptive man.

        sebastian looks like a kid on christmas eve.

                                sebastian
                  could you...

        his voice is trembling.

                                sebastian
                  show me something?

                                batty
                  like what?

                                sebastian
                  like...

        like a million things, but he's too excited to think of
        one.

                                batty
                  we're not computers, sebastian,
                  we're physical.

        pris perks up proudly.

                                pris
                  i think, therefore i am.

                                batty
                  very good, pris.  now show him why.

        it's a command pris is pleased to obey.  she sits quiet-
        ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper.
        mary doesn't like these displays, but batty is beaming.

        those hands in pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster
        than the eye can see and slam down on either side of
        her, digging into the material with such ferocity that
        sebastian jumps.  she plunges into the guts of the couch
        up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff-
        ing.  except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like
        an angel.

        sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like
        he's just seen the devil.  he laughs nervously, glad
        that the devil is a friend.

                                batty
                  we have a lot in common.

                                sebastian
                  you mean that you can't come here
                  and i can't go there?

                                batty
                  not only that, but we have smiliar
                  problems.  accelerated decrepitude.
                  but we don't want to die quite yet.

                                sebastian
                  of course not.

                                batty
                  you could help us.

                                sebastian
                  i don't know much about biomechanics,
                  roy.  i wish i did, but you're out
                  of my league.

                                batty
                  if we don't find help soon, pris
                  hasn't got long to live.

        sebastian sneaks a glance.  pris is staring at him with
        big childlike eyes, sebastian looks back at batty, moved
        but helpless.

                                batty
                  what about your friend, the man
                  who owns this building?

                                sebastian
                  dr. tyrell?

        batty nods.

                                sebastian
                  he's not really my friend.  i just
                  do a job for him now and then.

                                batty
                  tyrell could help us, sebastian.

                                sebastian
                  he could?

                                batty
                  his company made us.

                                sebastian
                  i'd be happy to mention it to him.

                                batty
                  be better if i could talk to him
                  in person.  but he's not an easy
                  man to get to.

                                sebastian
                  no.

                                batty
                  when do you deliver your project?

                                sebastian
                  this afternoon.

        batty leans forward and looks right into sebastian's
        eyes.

                                batty
                  will you help us?

        there's no way sebastian could say no, even if he
        wanted to.

                                sebastian
                  yes.

        pris sits up smiling.  mary sighs a breath of relief
        and batty leans back nodding in gratitude.

                                batty
                  i'm sure glad you found us,
                  sebastian.  what do you think,
                  mary?

                                mary
                  i don't think there is another
                  human being in this whole world
                  who would have helped us.

                                batty
                  pris?

        pris gets up and comes to sebastian and kisses him.

        that has a lot of impact.  sebastian looks around try-
        ing to keep the tears from coming.

                                batty
                  you're our best and only friend.

                                sebastian
                  thank you.
