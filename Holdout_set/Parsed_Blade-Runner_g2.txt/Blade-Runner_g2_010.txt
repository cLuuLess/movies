        int. inspector bryant's office - night                  11

        the inspector is in his fifties.  the deep creases in
        his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say
        brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the
        wall say something else.  bryant's kneeled at his safe
        trying to open it.  deckard it sitting on the edge of
        the desk reading the print-out.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  they escaped from the colonies
                  two weeks ago.  killed twenty-
                  three people and jumped a shuttle.
                  an aerial patrol found the ship
                  in the desert.  no crew.

        bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of
        whiskey.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  bryant's got a liver problem.  a
                  couple years back he handed me a
                  bottle and said have a drink for
                  another man.  i been drinking
                  for him ever since.

        deckard sets down the report and takes the shot bryant
        just poured for him.

                                deckard
                  six, huh?

                                bryant
                  five.  three nights ago one of
                  them managed to break into the
                  tyrell corporation.  killed two
                  guards and got as far as the
                  genetic sector before he got
                  fried going through an electro-
                  field.

                                deckard
                  what was he after?

                                bryant
                  there wasn't much left of him,
                  so we can't be sure.  but bio-
                  chemical data and morphology records
                  of the nexus-6 were reported
                  missing.  going on the possibility
                  they might try to infiltrate we
                  send holden in to run voight-kampff
                  tests on the new employees.  guess
                  he found himself one.

        a grim pause.

                                deckard
                  you got a machine on it yet?

                                bryant
                  we're using esper -- a 231 -- that
                  picked up holden's alarm.  its
                  guess is that all five are in
                  the city.

                                deckard
                  where do we start?

        bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle.

                                bryant
                  the tyrell corporation has a
                  demo model.  check it out on the
                  voight-kampff.  there's a chance
                  the nexus-6 is beyond out ability
                  to detect.  if that's the case,
                  everybody's up shit creek.

                                deckard
                  what was the cover on the one that
                  got holden?

                                bryant
                  industrial refuse.

                                deckard
                  garbage man?

        bryant nods.

                                deckard
                  did personnel have an address on
                  him?

        bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket,
        copies down a number and hands it over.

                                deckard
                  i'll go take a look.

        deckard stands and holds up his drink.

                                deckard
                  thanks.

        like a sick boy looking out of the window, bryant
        watches deckard down the whiskey.  deckard puts down
        the glass and turns to leave.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  the big incentive to emigrate was
                  still free labor.  if the public
                  found out that their door-prizes
                  might kill them, they might not be
                  so hot to go up there.  this was
                  one of the worst one's we had and
                  bryant was worried.  he wanted to
                  tell me to be discrete or something.
                  but i didn't give him a chance.
