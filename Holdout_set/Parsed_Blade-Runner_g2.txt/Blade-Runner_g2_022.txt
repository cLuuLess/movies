        int. cold storage room - night                          23

        except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in-
        struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a
        morgue.  the glass-doored compartments in the walls
        look like crypts.  some of them small as post office
        boxes.  from one of the chew removes a vacuum, packed
        box.  carefully separating the seal, he reaches into
        the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts
        an eye.

        through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered
        to remove, chew holds the eye up to the light and
        studies it a moment.  his other hand searches through
        his pockets.

                                chew
                  you got a pocket-charger, boy?

        quick to accommodate, sebastian removes a pencil-like
        device from a row of such things in his breast pocket
        and steps closer.  the back of the eye is touched with
        the pencil and the pupil moves.  suddenly its staring
        back at them.

                                chew
                  is that good enough for your
                  customer?

        anxious to leave, sebastian nods.  chew reseals the
        eye taking his time.  he can afford to, he's wearing
        his coat.

                                chew
                  how much is he paying you?

        in place of an answer, sebastian clears his throat,
        stares at the bag like he didn't hear.

                                chew
                  well, when do you get paid?

                                sebastian
                  soon as i finish the job.

                                chew
                  when might that be?

                                sebastian
                  day after tomorrow.

                                chew
                  oh!  day after tomorrow.

        sebastian nods.  chew stares at the poor bastard, con-
        cerned in spite of himself.

                                chew
                  the rich hate to pay, sebastian.
                  a guy like tyrell keeps you waiting.
                  pay the little guy last.  you should
                  charge twice as much.  it'll make
                  him feel better.

        sebastian nods his head like that's exactly what he'll
        do.  chew sees it's hopeless and hands him the bag.

                                sebastian
                  thanks, mr. chew.

        chew pulls the door open for him and sebastian goes
        through quick as a dog.
