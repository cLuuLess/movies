        int. stairwell - ninth and tenth floor - night          103

        deckard comes out onto the landing.  taking his time,
        he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor.
        he shoots the hinges out of the big stairwell door,
        pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a bang.
        the reverberations turn into silence.  the corridor is
        empty.
