                           because they come to destroy what i have come to love.

taka looks at him, moved and surprised. suddenly, higen jumps up and
bolts... out of the room. algren looks to taka.

                                              taka

                           and he is angry because i am the cause of that.

she smiles ever so slightly at his obliviousness.

                                             taka
                           no. he it angry because he fears you will die as well.
