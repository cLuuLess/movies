ext.                      siege room                     night

algren leads them into the highest room of the castle, the siege room. the
echoes yoritomo's death rings in their ears.                                   .

katsumoto glances at ujio and nakao. without a word, they kneel on the
floor, open their kimonos and unsheathe their short-swords, preparing to
commit seppuku.

                                             algren
                           no. wait...!

katsumoto glares at him harshly, furious to have his concentration disturbed
at such a moment.

                                              algren
                           there's a wa y out. look--!

reluctantly, katsumoto joins him at the window.

                                                                                                        96.
                                                algren
                             this place is designed to keep people from getting
                             in, not from getting out. we can make it

                                              ka tsumoto
                             this was your plan?

                                              algren
                             do you have a better one?

nakao and ujio look at katsumoto, awaiting his response. he turns to algren.

                                                 algren
                             i may die. but i'll die trying.

and without another word he launches himself out the window, onto the sloping roof.
