                            over antiquated military tactics.

                                                                               14.

                           nonetheless, i was impressed. i enjoy reading
                           military history. i spent two years studying
                           english at princeton university.

                           and where did you learn to speak japanese?


omura is perplexed by algren's remark, then realizes he is being kidded. he
laughs heartily. algren laughs with him. a connection is made.

                                              omura
                           yes, and in japanese there are twenty-seven
                           words for "war." i will be impressed if you learn
                           only half of them. .

he walks away. algren watches him go. his face darkens.

                                             algren
                           i got twenty-seven words too - reb, sioux,
                           pawnee, blackfoot, jappo. only one language
