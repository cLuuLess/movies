ext.                      around the inn                                 night

the samurai guards are alert, their senses heightened to almost superhuman proportions.

but there is another way. another way of learning combat. a wa y without the
beaut y, the philosophy and the moral code.

they are almost imperceptible at first... their head-to-toe black clothes a perfect
camouflage... their silence and stealth are otherworldly.

                                                                                                     66.

they were then known as shinobi, masters of stealth and spying.

we know them as ninjas.

they float across the ground ... creeping an inch ever y hour... complete
physica1 control. one black-gloved finger moves. then the next...

they crawl and then wait


poised on their fingertips and toes.

there is no sound as they strike.

the samurai guards are garroted in an instant. other ninjas catch the
samurai's weapons as they fall. no sound disturbs the peaceful night.
