later. the battle is over.

ninja and samurai corpses litter the inn.

we slowl y move up the long stairwa y from the bottom...

yoritomo pulls a ninja star from nakao's_shou1der. then one from his own.

we move up another level, past more bodies...

ujio moves through the ninjas. making sure they are dead. before sheathing
his sword, he angrily flicks it at the rice paper wall, spattering it with the bloody spray.

katsumoto wipes his sword on a nearby corpse, replaces it in its sheath. he sits beside
algren on a stair. both men are exhausted. bloodied. alive.

a long beat as we watch the two warriors.

slow fade to...
