int.                          inn -- katsumqto's room                      night

silence.

katsumoto lies in bed listening to the night bird. it stops singing. katsumoto smiles sadly. he
decides to give up on sleep, leans forward to rise.

this act saves his life.


for when the ninjas come, they come all at once--

a ninja suddenly comes tearing straight through the paper wall, his sword
slashing down .- just missing katsumoto.

katsumoto calls out an alarm, diving and rolling across the floor for his sword. he instantly
kills one ninja using his steel-tipped "war fan" to slash his attackers throat. another smashes
in through the window.
