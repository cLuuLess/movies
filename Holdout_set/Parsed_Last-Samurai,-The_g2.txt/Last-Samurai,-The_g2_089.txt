int.                          inn -- algren's room                              night

a ninja smashes through the paper wall -- algren grabs the nearest object, a low tea table.
and swings it at his head. the ninja dodges the blow and slices at algren with short-sword.

algren barely avoids the blow by ducking behind a post as the sword lodges
deep in the wood. algren flings himself, bodily, at his attacker.
