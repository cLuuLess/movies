int.               imperial palace -- throne                            room day


ambassador swanbeck, omura, and a retinue of advisors are presenting the
treaty documents for the emperor's signature. the emperor sits restively
on his throne.


                                                  ambassador swanbeck
                               ...will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity
                               and cooperation between our two great nations.
a servant comes and whispers into the emperor's ear.

                                                   omura
                                         (subtitles)
                               highness, if we could just conclude the matter
                               at hand...

the emperor ignores omura, and gestures that the doors to the chamber be opened.

algren enters with graham. algren carries something wrapped in a blanket.
he approaches the emperor. kneels and sets the bundle at the emperor's feet.
algren remains kneeling with his head bowed. he unwraps the bundle.

                                                                                    117.
it is katsumoto's long samurai sword.


'the emperor looks at it.

                                               omura
                                     (subtitled)
                            all your enemies are dead, enlightened one.

the emperor continues to look at the sword. he does not look up.

                                            emperor/translator
                                   (to algren)
                            you were with him at the end.

                                              algren/transla tor
                            yes. he asked that i bring you this -- that the
                            strength of the samurai will be with you alwa ys.

the emperor rises from his chair and sits on the floor, in the traditional
japanese fashion, before the sword.

                                               omura
                                     (after a moment)
                            en1ightcned one, we all weep for his loss, but
                            the future of our country lies in-


the emperor interrupts him, speaking in english -- to ever yone's surprise.

                                               emperor
                            my ancestors have ruled japan for 2,000 years.
                            and for all that time we have slept. during my
                            sleep i have dreamed. i dreamed of a unified
                            japan. of a country strong and independent and
                            modern...
                                     (touches the sword lovingly)
                            and now we are awake. we have railroads and
                            cannon and western clothing. but we cannot
                            forget who we are. or where we come from.

the emperor looks up at the gathered dignitaries.
               .
                                              emperor
                          ambassador swanbeck i have concluded that your treaty
                          is not in the best interests of my people.

                                              ambassador swandeck
                            sir, if i may--

                                              emperor
                            you may not. from this moment on, economic investment
                            from ever y nation will be considered equally.

                                                                                      118.

ambassador swanbeck is stunned.

                                            ambassador swanbeck
                          this is an outrage--

the emperor gestures. a servant escorts swanbeck to the exit. omura takes a step
closer to the emperor.

                                            omura
                                  (subtitled)
                          enlightened one, we should discuss this

                                            emperor
                                  (subtitled)
                          omura, do you know our northern island?

omura is confused.

                                              emperor
                                    (subtitled)
                          there is a small one called taraku. a rock in the sea.
                          there is nothing there but crabs who have been known
                          to tear a sleeping man apart ... i have had a small house
                          constructed on the island. you will go there now and
                          await our summons.

                                             omura
                                    (subtitled)
                          sir...?


                                             emperor
                                   (subtitled)
                          i hereby seize your family's assets and present them
                          as my gift to the people.

omura looks at him, stunned.

                                             emperor
                                   (subtitled)
                          further, i have decided to stop the railroad cxpansion
                          into yoshino.

                                            omura
                                  (subtitled)
                          enlightened one

                                             emperor
                                   (subtitled)
                          you have served your function. i have no more
                          need of you ... you can conspire with the crabs
                          now. remove yourself.

                                                                                         119.
                                                omura
                                      (protests, subtitled)
                             honored emperor, i do not know wh y you
                             disgrace me.

the emperor finally looks up from the sword.

                                                emperor
                                      (subtitled)
                             if your shame is too unbearable ... i offer you
                             this sword.

omura looks at him for a moment. then bows tersely and goes.

the emperor looks at algren, still kneeling before him.

                                              emperor
                                     (in english again)
                             the samurai is not a man now. he is an idea.
                                     (a beat)
                             tell me how he died.

algren looks at the emperor.

                                                algren
                             i will tell you how he lived.

we slowl y fade as algren begins to speak...
