algren stands at the gangplank. porters wait with his luggage. algren looks
back into the crowd and sees the ronin. they glare back, no longer trying to
keep out of sight.

a blast from the steam whistle.

them. finally, he looks out at the harbor and the ocean, beyond which
used to lie his home.

he turns to the bearer.
