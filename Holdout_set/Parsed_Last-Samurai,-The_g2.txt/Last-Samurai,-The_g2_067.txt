                            hai.

they look at each other for a long moment. she starts to move, but he stops
her. they are close enough to smell each other's hair, to feel the warmth of
the other's breath. she looks up at him, pleading with her eyes not to take this any further.

                                                                                                  60.

he lets her go.
