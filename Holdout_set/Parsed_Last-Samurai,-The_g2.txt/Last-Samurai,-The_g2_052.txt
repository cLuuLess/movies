ext.                        village                            day

katsumoto watches ujio bark orders to the men he is training. a sudden
movement of their eyes, causes uji o to stop. he turns to find:

algren standing at the end of the line, holding i wooden sword.

an almost imperceptible look passes bet ween ujio and katsumoto, but ujio's
resentment is over-ruled. without a word, he continues.


algren does his best to follow the exercise.


katsumoto, the slightest hint of a smile on his face, walks away.

                                              algren (v.o.)
                            each day i am confounded by their strange customs
                            and contradictions, savagery followed by
                            mildness.
