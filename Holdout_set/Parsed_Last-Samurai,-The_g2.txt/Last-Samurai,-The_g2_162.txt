the first division of the imperial army moves into the funnel, their numbers
reduced by the size of the access, and head toward the barricade.

katsumoto and algren watch as they move closer and closer. we
are expecting the samurai to open fire, but they do not. they just
wait.

finally the imperial soldiers are in rifle range. they stop to fi re a volley.

bullets begin hitting among the samurai. many fall.

algren nods to katsumoto, katsumoto then calls out a command and the
samurai retreat.

they race back toward the rear of the funnel.

the imperial army soldiers climb awkwardly over the first barricade and
pursue--

the samurai, meanwhile, have taken cover behind a second barricade that
had been hidden from the imperial soldiers' view. now safel y behind
the second barricade, katsumoto calls out a command and--

the samurai fire!

500 arrows explode -- almost instantly followed by 500 more --

like an image from agincourt, the clouds of arrows sweep across the sky --

imperial soldiers fall, the attack falters--

from behind the new barricades, archers fire flaming arrows, that
hit the old barricade. it explodes into flames, trapping the imperia1
army bet ween the two barricades.

and from the second barricade, two large ca tapults send balls of flaming
pitch into the already panicking soldiers.
