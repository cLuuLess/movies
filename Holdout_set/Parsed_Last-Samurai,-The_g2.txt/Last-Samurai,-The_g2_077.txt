int.         katsumoto's rqom                              night

algren is escorted in. katsumoto kneels at a table. preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony.

                                                katsumoto
                             sit, captain.

algren sits. by now he has learned how to sit on the ground. katsumoto begins the exacting, delicate and
precise tea ceremony.

                                              katsumoto
                             do you drink tea?

                                                  algren
                             i've had little else for some time...

katsumoto continues with the tea ceremony.

                                            algren
                             how's your poem coming?

                                              katsumoto
                             i am having trouble. the truth is i am not a very
                             good poet.
                                     (algren smiles)
                             do you know wh y you were sent here? to
                             yoshino.

                                                algren
                             to protect the railroad.

                .                              katsumoto
                             why is the railroad here?

                                             algren
                             so tokyo can control the whole country.

                                                                                                       64.
                                           katsumoto
                           you have seen my province. all mountains.
                           far from tokyo. yet the rail line must come
                           here?

katsumoto tosses a tiny bit of coal on the simmering brazier on the table. algren watches carefully.

                                           algren
                           you have something they want

                                           katsumoto
                           what do they want in my mountains?

                                                algren
                           minerals ... gold.

                                                ka tsumoto
                                    (smiles)
                           there is no gold in japan.

katsumoto gently blows on the coal brazier. the coal flares a bit.

                                                algren
                           coal?
                                    (katsumoto looks at him)
                           for steamships.

                                          ka tsumoto
                           and why would steamships be so important?

                                                algren
                           ...china.

katsumoto looks up at him. impressed.

                                            katsumoto
                           japan has nothing. china has ever ything.

                                              algren
                           mine the coal to create a way station for the trip to
                           china ... freeze the europeans out and japan and
                           america have a monopol y on the china trade.

                                            katsumoto
                           add to this the omura zaibatsu. you know the
                           zaibatus?

                                           algren
                           the wealthy families.

                                                                                                       65.


                                              katsumoto
                           as patron of the railroad, omura owns all land within
                            four hundred feet of ever y new rail line. as my country
                           grows, so will his wealth.
                                    (looks at him)
                           this is why you are fighting.

katsumoto completes the tea ceremony. he pours a cup for algren. bows his head and offers it to him.

                                              algren
                           and you will tell the emperor to stop them?

                                              katsumoto
                           i do not tell the emperor what to do.

                                           algren
                           then what do you hope to accomplish?

katsumoto looks at algren, the slightest gleam in his eye.

                                             katsumoto
                           will you return to america?

algren watches him -- why didn't katsumoto answer?

                                              algren
                           ...i have a job here.

                                            katsumoto
                           you should return to your home.

                                             algren
                           why?

                                            katsumoto
                           because i do not wish you to be m y enemy again.

katsumoto returns to his poem, he does not look up.

                                           katsumoto
                           go home captain ... anshinritsumai. i wish you peace.

algren waits but katsumoto just continues to work on his poem.
