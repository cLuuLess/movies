ext.                     village                            night

yoritomo appears. he and algren crawl out of the house just as the ground lurches
violently-

part of the house contorts and caves in

around the village, the wooden frame houses are swa ying and lurching they have some
torque, but not enough

ujio directs the villagers as they battle a fire-

taka appears, calling frantically for toshiie.

then an even larger seismic tremor suddenly tears through the
village

houses are ripped apart -- the whole world shifting.

though the smoke, algren sees toshiie cowering under an eave

                                                                                               58.

a heavy ceiling beam breaks loose, threatens to crush toshiie

algren dives forward, grabs toshiie and pulls him out of the wa y... the front
of the house collapses, the beams smashing to the ground..

taka and higen race to algren and toshiie. the boy is safe.

taka grabs the child and cradles him. her look to algren is fierce, protective,
almost feral -- as if he were the threat instead of the rescuer.
