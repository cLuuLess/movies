                             ... 1 don't know what to say, sir. i never would
                             have thought him capable of treason.

                                              omura
                             i would say captain algren's acts tonight have
                             assured our success.

                           what do you mean?

                           katsumoto will rejoin his kinsmen. they will fight.
                           we will destroy them with your new weapons.

                           what if he just goes off to the mountains and
                           becomes a damn sheep-herder or some such?

                                             omura
                           you still do not understand us ... katsumoto can
                           do nothing but fight. it is his role in the drama.
                           he must act out his destiny. he knows it.

                                              ambassador swanbeck
                           you trust a lot in destiny.

                           this story was written years ago. from the first
                           sight of your warships in our harbor...
                                      (stares out the window)
                           it is a1l inevitable.
