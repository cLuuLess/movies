in the main cabin, algren sits with gant and omura. algren is drinking.


                                              omura
                            ...after the shogun gave up power, the daimyos ­
                            you would call them warlords --knew that japan
                            needed a centralized government. so they asked

                                                                                      11.
                                            omura (cont'd)
                           the hereditary emperor, his highness the
                           enlightened meiji, to lead the country.

                                            algren
                           and these warlords just ... gave up hundreds of
                           years of power?

                                             omura
                           economic incentives were offered. most
                           provincial leaders saw the financial benefits of
                           modernization.

                                            algren
                           what about those that didn't?

                                             omura
                           to deal with those who have resisted, the
                           emperor has decided to create an army with
                           allegiance only to him... we considered hiring
                           advisors from germany, but your ambassador
                           reminded us of your experience in suppressing rebellious
                           elements in your civil war.

this evocation of the civil war is not lost on algren.

                                          algren
                           who are we supposed to be fighting against?

                                            omura
                           his name is mori katsumoto. he is samurai.

                                             algren
                           samurai?

                                              omura
                           the word you might use it "warrior". but that
                           does not quite capture it ... katsumoto once served
                           the emperor but he is now a traitor who leads a
                           band of traitors. he must be punished.

algren looks pointedly at bagley.

                                               algren
                           you told them about our experiences together
                           on sutter's hill, did you, colonel?

                                           bagley
                           they know i was your commanding officer.
                           yes.

algren glares at bagley, then stands.

                                                                                 12.



                                             algren
                           excuse me, gentlemen. i need some air.
                                    (to omura)
                           i'm sure colonel bagley can amuse you with
                           more stories of patriotic gore.

he walks away.

                                                 omura
                           he is insolent.

                                             bagley
                           get him in front of the troops, you'll see. top
                           of his class at west point. brilliant tactician.
                           even wrote a book.

                                            omura
                           why did he leave your army?

                                             bagley
                           what's a hero to do when there's no more great
                           battles?

                                              omura
                           is that an evasive answer?

                                               bagley
                           sir, this man was left for dead at sutter's hill.
                           doct ors swore his heart had stopped beating,
                           but before they could bury him, he came back to
                           life. after the war he fought the sioux, the cree,
                           and the blackfoot.
                                   (leans closer)      .
                           point him at the enemy. he was born for it.
