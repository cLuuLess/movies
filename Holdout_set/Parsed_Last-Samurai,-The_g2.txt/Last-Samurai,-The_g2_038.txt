int.                yoritomo's house                   following

yoritomo and the woman hurry to algren's room --

algren in the throes of his recurring nightmare - awakens, disoriented.


                                             algren
                           sake.

yoritomo and the woman confer. yoritomo looks it algren and shakes his
head, no.

                                                                                      39.

                                              algren
                           sake!

yoritomo refuses -- algren roars and tries to rise. laughing at algren's
ferocit y in his weakened condition, yoritomo easily pushes him back down.

algren folds in on himself, rocking like a feral animal.
