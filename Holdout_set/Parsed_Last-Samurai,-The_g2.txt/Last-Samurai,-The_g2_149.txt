ext.    cherry tree forest--near the village                       evening

katsumoto rides at the head of his samurai as they pass through the cherry
orchard. then he reins his horse and falls in beside algren.

                                              katsumoto
                                    (his voice troubled)
                           i was prepared to die in omura's castle. and
                           yet here i am. i cannot help but ask why were
                           you sent into my life. what is the lesson you
                           were meant to give me?

                                            algren
                           maybe that neither of us is as smart as we
                           thought...

katsumoto laugh. and then in a surprisingly deft imitation of algren


                                              katsumoto
                           you...ain't whistlin' dixie...


he spurs his horse and heads off. algren shakes his head and follows.
