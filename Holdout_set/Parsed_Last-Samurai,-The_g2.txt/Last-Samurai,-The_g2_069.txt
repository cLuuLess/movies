ext. meadow                            day

algren carries water from the river through a riot of spring wild-flowers. something
makes him stop, and see the sunlit clouds in the deep blue sky, the colors around him, hear the
buzzing of the bees, feel the kill of the air.

a sudden flash of memory

his beautiful wife, in green field not unlike this one, laughing, tossing her hair, falling
back into the long grass.

back to algren

                                                                                                  61.

the force of the memory causes him to link to the ground.

another flash of memory, longer this time:

his wi fe leans over and kisses his mouth, and his cheek, and his forehead. he holds
her al tightly as be can.

back to algren

as tears begin to course down his face, and he sinks down into the flowers and the grass,
looking up into the impossibl y beautiful sky. he gives in to the sobs wracking his body.
