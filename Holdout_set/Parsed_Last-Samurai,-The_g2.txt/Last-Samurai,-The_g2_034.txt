int.                      yoritomo's house                              another day

algren now sits in the main room. the woman is changing the dressing on
his wounded right shoulder and arm.

yoritomo kneels across from algren. he is impressed at the many battle
wounds on algren's body; the old bullet wounds and scars. in japanese, he
indicates his admiration.

algren his no idea what yoritomo is saying. finally he interrupts with the
only japanese word he has bothered to learn:

                                               algren
                            sake.

                                                                                 38.

yoritomo's face breaks into a wide smile.

                                             yoritomo
                           sake?

                                             algren
                           sake.

yoritomo glances to the woman. she nods, and brings a1gren a saucer of
sake. he drinks it down. holds out the saucer for a refill

smiling, yoritomo indicates for the woman to comply, but before she can
pour another saucer, algren takes the jug out of her other hand. yoritomo
laughs as algren drinks it down.
