int.                     inn-- katsumoto's room                          night

katsumoto, breathing heavily, his kimono shredded and bloody, is fending off the ninjas' increasingly
savage attacks as algren enters.

algren screams, distracting them just long enough for katsumoto to take advantage and kill one.

                                                                                                               69.
then, just as a ninja it about to kill algren, katsumoto flings his short sword ... it pin-wheels across the
room, hitting algren's attacker in the chest.

without missing a beat, algren pulls the short sword from the dying ninja's chest and uses it to stab
another ninja who, thinking algren defenseless, has launched an attack.
