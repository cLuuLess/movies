int.                     katsumoto's chamber                          dusk

servants he1p dress katsumoto in his exacting samurai wardrobe as algren is ushered in.

                                             katsumoto
                           captain, i had not thought to see you again.

                                                                                      82.
                                             algren
                          i'm leaving tomorrow. but before i go i need to
                          tell you what's going on here.

                                            katsumoto
                          you mean the gatling guns and the howitzers,
                          is that how you sa y it?

                                             algren
                          they're about to close a trade agreement that
                          will bring this country more weapons than
                          you can imagine.

                                            katsumoto
                          yes, if the emperor agrees - but omura knows
                          the emperor must be convinced there is cause to
                          need those weapons before be will sign.

                                           algren
                                  (realizing)
                          and you are to be the cause...

                                              katsumoto
                          elegant, isn't it? omura passes laws sure to cause
                          a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons.
                          the emperor sees that the weapons are needed
                          so he agrees to the entire treaty, giving your
                          country what it wants and the omura zaibatsu
                          what it wants. and my country is sold to yours.

as katsumoto dresses, algren notes that katsumoto's body it at battleground
of old scars, so like his own.

                                            ka tsumoto
                          today the council passed two edicts. the first called for
                          the elimination of our traditional topknots.

                                             algren
                          i know.

                                          katsumoto
                          the second banned the wearing of sword.

algren stops. he knows what swords mean to the samurai.


                                            katsumoto
                                  (re: his swords)
                          hand them to me, will you?

algren picks up katsumoto's two swords. looks at him deeply.

                                             algren
                          if you do this, they will kill you.

                                                                                                         83.
                                                ka tsumoto
                           i am hard to kill.

                                           algren
                           you don't know what their weapons can do. all
                           your men butchered ... just for pride.

                                             katsumoto
                           not for pride. for the emperor.

                                            algren
                           but the emperor is the one signing the agreement.

                                            katsumoto
                           he has not signed it yet.

he holds out katsumoto's two samurai swords.

                                                 algren
                           is it worth it? ... just for these,

                                             katsumoto
                           i cannot live without my soul ... can you?

they regard each other.
