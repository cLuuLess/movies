the cherry blossoms have emerged, creating a scene of intense col or, beauty,
and serenity. the emperor sits cross-legged next to a shrine. he is approached by omura and two other
advisors.                                                                        .

                                    (the emperor nods)

                           majest y has signed the order regarding the railroad progress.

                           upon the air, as if held by unseen hands.
