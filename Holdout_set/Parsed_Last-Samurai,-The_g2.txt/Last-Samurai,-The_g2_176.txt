ext.                               village                             day

we see that yoritomo's house has finally been completed.. toshiie sits on the porch,
instructing a group of younger children in calligraphy.

                                                                                    120.

                           as for the american captain, no one knows
                           what became of him. all that is left is his journal
                           which i have published, according to his last request.

taka steps from the house and passes toshiie, she carries a basket. we
move through the village with her...

                           some lay he died of his wounds, others that he
                           returned to his own country...

she passes an old man teaching the noh drama to a group of teenagers.

she passes higen, working on a new building. apparently he has found a
good life as a carpenter. he seems content.

we go with taka as she leaves the village...
