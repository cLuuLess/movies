int.           restaurant                  night

gant leads algren into a lush san francisco restaurant. flickering gaslight
and trays of lobster. colonel benjamin bagley (whom we saw in
flashback) sits with the three japanese men. bagley's hair has greyed. he

                                                                                  9.
has his eye on a political future.

                                             bagley
                            nathan, good to see you.

                                              algren
                                    (stunned)
                            colonel bagley...

                                              bagley
                            sit down. this is mr. omura, from japan, and
                            his two associates who, so far as i can tell, don't
                            have names...

omura 40, is a handsome and intelligent man. he watches algren closel y
as algren pours a glass or whiskey from a decanter.

                                                bagley
                            they're looking to hire real american soldiers to
                            create the first japanese imperial army.

algren looks at him.

                                               bagley
                            japan's got it in mind to become a civilized
                            country and they're willing to spend what it takes
                            to hire white experts to do the job right.

algren takes a slow lip of whiskey.

                                             bagley
                            sergeant gant has already agreed to serve. you
                            would be m y second-in-command.

                                             algren.
                            with approval from washington, of course.

                                               bagley
                            both governments prefer to consider our mission
                            unofficial. we'd be there as non-combatants
                                               bagley
                                               (more)
                            only, advisors to the japanese officers. help
                            them with training, ordinance and the like.

                                              gant
                            you ought to think about it., captain. unless
                            you intend to take up a career in the theater.

                                              algren
                            i have an agreement with the winchester
                            corporation -- i'm sure these people have some
                            concept of what an agreement is.

                                                                               10.

omura suddenly speaks. his english is flawless.

                                             omura
                            you are paid seven dollars for each performance.
                            you do, on average, fourteen performances a
                            year. we will pay you 400 dollars.

                                               algren
                            a year?

                                               omura

                            a month.

algren looks at him. the figure, in 1876, is staggering.


ext              ship--ocean                     day

a steamship chums its wa y across the great pacific. algren leans on the
ship's rail and looks out into an endless processi on of wa ves.

                                               algren (v.o.)
                            june 23, 1876. it is impossible, standing here,
                            not to appreciate one's, own insignificance.

a dolphin crests the surface, arcing into the air.

                                               algren (v.o.)
                            here there is neither past, nor future. only an
                            oblivion of water.

in his tiny cabin, algren finishes writing in his journal and takes out a
daguerreot ype of a hauntingly beautiful blond woman.

                                              algren (v.o.)
                            and yet i ask myself, will the dead follow me
                            across the ocean to this strange new land?

he stares at the woman in the picture.
