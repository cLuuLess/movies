ext.             plain                            almost sunset

the plain before the barricade is littered with imperial army dead.

algren and katsumoto sit exhausted, leaning against the barricade. they are
both wounded.

only about. hundred samurai are still alive.

algren looks over the decimated warriors for a moment. even those still
alive are in bad shape as they wait for the next wave of imperial soldiers.

katsumoto is looking at ujio's body nearby.

                                           katsumoto
                           he was kaishaku ... my trusted friend.

                                            algren
                           we won't be able to hold them back this time.

                                             katsumoto
                           this is not your battle. you do not have to die
                           here.

 a long beat.

                                              algren
                           i died a long time ago.

                                            katsumoto
                           but now you live again.

                                               algren
                           yes.

                                             katsumoto
                           it was not your time.

                                            algren
                           no. maybe i survived just to live this one last day.

algren looks at him.

                                                                                      112.
                                               algren
                            i'll stay.

he slowl y pulls himself up. he and katsumoto gaze at the plain before them.

at the infantry troops massing on the opposing hilltop.

algren looks at katsumoto. he reaches into the pocket of his old uniform
and takes out the medal of honor he received, long ago, at sutter's hill.

he affixes it to his old cavalry tunic.

katsumoto looks at algren. they are both thinking the same thing.

silent agreement.
