ext.                 mountain ridge                      day


algren and katsumoto ride.

                                           algren
                           they have the howitzers.

                                             katsumoto
                           how many?

                                             algren
                           about a dozen.

                                                                                              102.

katsumoto considers this. algren looks up into the mountains.

                                              algren
                            a man could get lost up there ... build an army.
                            hold out a very long time.

                                              katsumoto
                            algren-san...have you seen what happens to the
                            villages that stand in the way of the railroad?

algren nods. he remembers.

                                               katsumoto
                            that is what will happen to my village if we do
                            not stand and fight.
                                     (looks at him)
                            no. we serve the emperor here.

                                               algren
                            by dying?

                                               katsumoto
                            perhaps.

                                              algren
                            at least make it battle, not a suicide.

                                            katsumoto
                            and what would that accomplish?

algren lifts his head, enjoying the feeling of the sun and wind on his face.

                                                algren
                            it might give you one more day ... one more
                            fine day like this.

katsumoto stares at him for a long moment, then smiles and spurs his horse. algren follows.

they ride together, side by aide, the wind billowing their cloaks -- we enjoy the
ride as they do, the trees strobing by, the sun slanting through the leaves.
