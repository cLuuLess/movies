int.                 shinto shrine                        day

algren is led past baldheaded monks into an ancient shrine. katsumoto
kneels before a small altar. he doesn't seem aware that algren is present.

                                             katsumoto
                           ujio is teaching you the wa y of the japanese sword.

                                              algren
                           is that what he's doing?

                                            katsumoto
                           at what age did you become i soldier?

                                              algren
                           nineteen.

                                             ka tsumoto
                           to fight in your american civil war.

                                              algren
                           yes.

                                             ka tsumoto
                           tell me about that war'.

                                              algren
                           what about it?

                                              katsumoto
                           everything.

                                            algren
                           everything about the civil war?


katsumoto sits impassively, staring at the altar.

                                            algren
                           that would take a year.

                                           katsumoto
                           you have pressing business elsewhere?

shaking his head, algren sits down.

                                                                                             47.


                                              algren
                           the civil war began on april 12. 1861 when the
                           rebs attacked fort sumter. well, actually, it
                           probabl y began three years earlier when the
                           supreme court decided a runaway slave had to
                           be returned to his master

                                                                               disolve to:

the two of them, hours later--

                                              algren
                           --and pickett says he wants to do it, over
                           longstreet's objections and lee doesn't know
                           what to think, but he lets him. so 15,000 men
                           go up that hill. and most of them die.

                                                katsumoto
                           was that wise?

                                                algren
                           no, it was stupid.

                                                katsumoto
                           why?

                                             algren
                           the point of a battle is to win, or at least have
                           enough men survive to fight another day.

                                             katsumoto
                           you did not try to survive when we took you
                           prisoner.

algren eyes him, frustrated.

                                          algren
                           what do you want from me?

                                          katsumoto
                           what do you want for yourself?

                                           algren
                           you know they're not going to ransom me.

                                             katsumoto
                           we have little use for money.

                                                                                   48.
                                              algren
                                     (mounting fury)
                            then what are you doing, why are you asking me
                            these questions, what is going on here?

                                               katsumoto
                            the snows will melt in may, and the passes will
                            open, and the events of the world will unfold.
                            until that time, you are here.
                                     (smiles)
                            i enjoyed this conversation in your english. i
                            hope you will honor me with more tomorrow.

katsumoto stands, bows, and leaves.
