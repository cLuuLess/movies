int.                         outside katsumoto's room                         night

a guard stands sentinel. above his head, unbeknownst to him, two ninjas descend on ropes.
one of them swings a long chain - to which i barbed-knife is attached.

as it lodges in the guard's chest, the second ninja swings down just in time to catch the dead guard,
silently, before his body hits the ground.
