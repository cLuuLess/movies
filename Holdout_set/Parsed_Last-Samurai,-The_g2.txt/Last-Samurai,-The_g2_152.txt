higen stands, looking up at the stars.

                           my father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.

                                              algren
                                    (subtitles)
                           that is what he believed.

                                              higen
                                    (subtitles)
                           i would be afraid to die in battle.

                                             algren
                                   (subtitles)
                           so would i.

                                                                                  100.

                                              higen
                                    (subtitles)
                            but you have been in many battles.

                                              algren
                                    (subtitles)
                            and i was always afraid.

higen looks at him, tears welling in his eyes.

                                               higen
                                     (subtitles)
                            i don't want you to go.

algren has no answer. he can only gather the boy up in his arms and hold
him.

ext village day

nakao is standing proudly, his massive arms folded across his chest. we
pull back: graham is bunched behind his photographic equipment. a flash
of phosphorous and the moment is immortalized.

meanwhile, algren is working with higen on the house.

katsumoto silently watches algren working with the boy.

                                                 katsumoto
                            algren-san.

algren turns.

                                                 katsumoto
                            they are corning.

ext      mountains          day

algren and katsumoto perch on a precipice, looking down into a valley.

it is a beautiful setting. towering peaks and peaceful valleys. it is here that
the final act of the inevitable drama will play out.

bel ow they see the imperial army, thousands strong, marching across the
valley toward them. terrifying martial columns in strict formation.

                                                algren
                            i call it five thousand troops. they'll come in
                            waves of about a thousand, a few minutes between
                            each wave.

katsumoto listens carefully to algren's expertise.

                                                                                101.
                                              algren
                           german formations have the infantry staggered
                           with on1y light flanking. they'll come straight on
                           with rifles and fixed bayonets. mausers are only
                           accurate to about 150 yards. they'll look to
                           overthrow us.

katsumoto takes this in.
