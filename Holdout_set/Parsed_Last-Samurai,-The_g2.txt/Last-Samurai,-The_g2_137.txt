int.             castle--tight corridor                         following

they stride through a tight, dark stone corridor.

suddenly, a cadre of omura guards emerge from the shadows.

without hesitation, they launch into battle. algren and katsumoto wield
their swords. yoritomo and ujio fire arrows.

nakao fights with his hands, dramatic martial arts from the huge man.

                                                                                                                 94.
but this corridor is just too tight -- it is a sea of combat.. the guards and
our warriors are slammed together --the swords and pikes sending up sparks
in the darkness as they strike the stone walls.

the right corridor echoes with samurai war cries and clanging swords.

then...

more guards appear.

these guards have rifles.

rifle blasts thunder --startling strobe-like bursts of light in the darkness --

algren dives in front of katsumoto to protect him-

yoritomo is hit-

he jerks back -- blood--

ujio fires arrows at the guards with rifles, hitting two -- but more guards with rifles are appearing, bullets
sending showers of debris and ricochets--

algren sees a stairway leading to a higher 1evel, barks out a command. as nakao drags
yoritomo toward the stairs-- the others bolt a heavy siege door Â­
designed to keep attackers at bay.
