ext.                  parade ground                              day

algren walks onto the parade ground. the change he sees could not be more remarkable.
thousands of new japanese troops are drilling with new bolt-action mausers. they
are precise, exact and frighteningly mechanistic, their uniforms new and crisp.

new german advisors are barking commands. colonel bagley sees him.

                                          bagley
                           algren? my god, you never cease to astonish.

bagley runs over, hand extended, but algren turns to look at the troops.

                                          algren
                           they have new weapons.

                                              bagley
                           the kaiser was only too happy to help. along
                           with his friends at mauser and krupp. thank god we
                           americans still have a few teeth in our head.

and they come to the "teeth." howitzer cannons. a row of them. artillery
officers in us army uniforms arc instructing japanese offi cers.

                                             bagley
                           the ambassador and i have spent eight months
                           kissing omura's ass so he'll sign the damn trade
                           pact with us. you spent all this time living with
                           those savages?
                                    (a1gren looks at him)
                           he's going to want to talk to you...

                                              algren
                           i need a bath.

                                           bagley
                           and your back pay, i imagine.

algren starts walking away.

                                                                                                    72.

                                             bagley
                           they got their flag. ...see?

and we see it... snapping on i flagpole high above the parade ground.


it is immediately familiar. a red circle on a white field. the rising sun.

the howitzers fire in sequence. thundering blasts that shake the heavens.


ext,               royal temple                               day


omura stands above emperor meiji respectful but persistent.

the emperor is kneeling, tending to his iris garden. it is one of the wonders of the palace: a
sea of white, pink, blue, and purple blossoms.

retainers and servants stand at a distance. one holds a standard with the imperial seal: a yellow
chrysanthemum.

omura sees katsumoto making his way toward them. he talks a bit more quickly to the emperor.

katsumoto begins to prostrate himself before the emperor, the usual sign of extreme
respect -- but the emperor stops him:

                                             emperor
                                   (subtitles)
                           no, mori-san. we arc "civilized" now.

katsumoto stops prostrating himself. the emperor offers his hand.

                                              katsumoto
                                    (subtitles)
                           i cannot touch the sacred one.

                                             emperor
                                   (subtitles)
                           you can.

it is a difficult moment for katsumoto. he simply cannot do it.

                                             omura
                                   (subtitles)
                           did you have a pleasant journey, minister katsumoto?

                                              katsumoto
                                    (subtitles)
                           it was uneventful.

omura appreciates katsumoto's droll response. he assumes that katsumoto is aware of
his part in the assassination attempt.

                                                                                          73.

                                              emperor
                                    (subtitles)
                         if it is not a great imposition. i desire a moment alone with
                         minister katsumoto. omura-san.

                                           omura

                                   (subtitles)
                         enlightened one, perhaps i can be of service in a conversation
                         of state.

                                            emperor
                                  (subtitles)
                         so kind of you, but i fear my old teacher wishes to upbraid
                         me in private for neglecting my studies.

omura bows his head quickly and goes.


silence. the emperor gazes at katsumoto. then:

                                           emperor
                                 (subtitles)
                         you rise against me, my teacher.

                                           katsumoto
                                 (subtitles)
                         no, highness, i rise against your enemies.

                                           emperor
                                 (subtitles)
                         they are my teacher, my advisers, like you.

                                           katsumoto
                                 (subtitles)
                         they advise in their own interest.

                                             emperor
                                   (subtitles)
                         the world is changing, mori -- you have not seen what
                         goes on beyond our borders, the inventions, the science.
                          i need men who can look outward, or soon we will be
                         left behind, and defenseless.

                                           katsum oto
                                 (subtitles)
                         i am sworn to defend you even to my last breath.

                                            emperor
                                   (subtit1es)
                         the samurai live in the past. you cannot defend against
                         a future you don't understand.

                                                                                         74.
                                            katsumoto
                                  (subtitles)
                         if i am no use, then i will happily end my life,

                                            emperor
                                  (subtitles)
                         no, mori. it is my wish that you rejoin the council of state.
                         i need your voice.

                                             katsumoto
                                   (subtitles)
                         it is your voice that needs to be heard, highness. you
                         are a living god, you can do what ever you
                         think is right.

the young emperor is silent a moment.

                                             emperor
                                   (subtitles)
                         i am a living god only as long as i do what they
                         think is right.

                                            katsumoto
                                  (subtitle)
                         your highness, may i beg forgiveness for saying
                         what a teacher must, that such a statement is pathetic
                         drivel not worthy of an ignorant stable boy, let alone
                         a young man i know to have some modest intelligence.

the emperor laughs warmly, almost happy to be scolded as he once was.

                                              emperor
                                   (subtitles)
                         is it possible a living god can be too afraid to make
                         his voice heard?
                                   (katsumoto's look is not unkind)
                         tell me what to do, mori-san?

                                           katsumoto
                                 (subtitles)
                         you are emperor, my lord, not me. you must find
                         the wisdom for all of us.
