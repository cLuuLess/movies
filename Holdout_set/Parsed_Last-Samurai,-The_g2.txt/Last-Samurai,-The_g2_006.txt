int.           seedy hotel room                     night

algren is back in the hotel room. from his small suitcase, he takes the
medal of honor, looks at it for a long moment.

                                              algren (v.o.)
                            "do not be afraid," they whisper. "you have been
                            dead, too."

a sudden flash:

we are back on sutter's hill. algren's slaughtered cavalry litter the bloody
ground, dead to the last man. a rebel army surgeon gives a cursory look at
each body before it is loaded onto a wagon.

algren's turn is no different than the others. he is declared dead and hoisted
unceremoniously onto the pile of corpses.

back in the. hotel room.:

algren sits, staring into the middle distance.

                                              algren (v.o.)
                            is this why they gave their lives? so that i might
                            disgrace their memory?

he reaches into the suitcase and takes out a colt revol ver. stares at it, cracks
the cylinder to make sure it's loaded. his finger wraps around the trigger,
the barrel makes its wa y toward his head.

and then, unaccountabl y, he is laughing.

                                             algren (v.o.)
                            and why, after taking so many lives, do i find
                            myself incapable of taking just one more?

a knock on the door. algren shuts his eyes, then calls out.

                                                 algren
                            go awa y.

                                              gant (v .o.)
                            not exactly the greeting i imagined.

                                                                                                                  8.
algren looks up. he knows that voice. he carefully puts the revolver back into the suitcase and shuts it before
opening the door.


                                            gant
                           thought you'd seen the last of me, i expect.

algren is filled with emotion, which he tries to hide.


                                              algren
                           zeb...

they embrace.

                                              algren

                           sit. please.


gant moves to the proffered chair with a pronounced limp.

                                               gant
                           ... saw your little melodrama         toda y.
                           very inspiring... .

                                            algren
                           given up soldiering to become a critic?

gant smiles and shakes his head.

                                             gant
                           got a job for you, unless you're running for
                           office...

                                              algren
                           i have i job.

                                              gant
                           i mean a real job. back in uniform.

                                              algren
                           i' m retired.

                                             gant
                           i don't mean a u.s. uniform.

algren looks at him. curious despite himself.
