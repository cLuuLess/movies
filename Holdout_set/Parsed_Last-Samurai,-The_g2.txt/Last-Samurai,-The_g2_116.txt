ext.                            living quarters                       afternoon

a bearer is loading the last of algren's luggage on the back of a rickshaw.
algren emerges from the building, sees the same two disreputable men
who followed him earlier lurking nearby.

he resists the temptation to confront them. instead he climbs into the
rickshaw and it starts off.
but a moment later, graham has jogged alongside, huffing and puffing.

                                                      graham
                                     thought i'd missed you. were you going to leave
                                     without even saying goodbye?

                                                        algren
                                     i have a fear of sentimental englishmen.

                                                       graham
                                     you sod.
                                              (trying to keep up)
                                     christ, give us. . second here

algren indicates for the bearer to stop. graham tries to catch his breath.

                                                       graham
                                     you're making a mistake, i promise you.
                                     katsumoto's under house arrest, omura's made
                                     his move -- he'll need you more than ever --

graham stops, sees the look on algren's face, realizes.

                                                        graham
                                     oh, my goodness. how silly of me.. all that
                                     time you were with him, up in those mountains,
..................................   ...i told you they were a remarkable people...

algren doesn't answer, but isn't denying it either.

                                                     graham
                                     then you should get out. because omura will
                                     become rather impatient with anyone who isn't on the team.

graham notices algren staring at his followers.

                                                       graham
                                     case in point.

                                                       algren
                                     who are they?

                                                       graham
                                     ronin would be m y guess. disgraced samurai
                                     doing odd jobs for his nibs.

                                                                                 87.

                                           algren
                           what do they want from me?

                                            graham
                           to make sure you're on the side of god and
                           country, or to make sure you get the hell out.

                                            algren
                           you've been a great help, graham. i thank you.

                                            graham
                           look who's getting sentimental now.

a look bet ween them, then algren nods for the bearer to continue.
