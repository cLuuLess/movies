colonel bagley, omura, several german advisors and japanese officers ride
at the head of the imperial army.                                         .

bagley sees something, raises a hand. the troops halt.

algren and katsumoto ride up to them. stop.

                                             algren
                           colonel.

                                              bagley
                           captain... (to katsumoto)... sir, the imperial
                           army of japan demands your surrender. if you
                           and your fellows lay down your arms you will
                           not be harmed.

                                             katsumoto
                           that is not possible. as omura knows.

omura meets katsumoto's look, nods. bagley turns to algren.

                                             bagley
                           captain algren, we will show no quarter. you
                           ride against us and you are the same as they are.

                                               algren
                           i take that as a compliment, colonel.
                                      (a deadly calm)
                           i'll look for you on the field.

algren and katsumoto wheel their horses and go.
