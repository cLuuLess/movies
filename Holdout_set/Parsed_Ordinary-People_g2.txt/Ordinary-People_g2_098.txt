               conrad hits him hard with a jab, then jumps on him. they fall
               in the plastic bags of the disposal, conrad still hitting.
               lazenby tries to stop him. conrad pushes him away. two
               students take hold of conrad and pull him away, two others
               with stillman.
          
                                      lazenby

                            enough.
          
                                      students
                            no, stillman, no! no!
          
                                      stillman
                            let go! let go!
          
                                      lazenby

                            calm down, uh?

                            know that?
          
               conrad walks back to his car
          
                                      stillman (cont'd)
                            send him back where he came from!
          
                                      others
                            now, now, it's over. it's over.
          
                                         stillman
                            all right!     shit!
          
               stillman hits a garbage bag.
