                          why'd you let go?
          
                                    dr berger
                          because i got tired!
          
                                    conrad
                          yeah? well. screw you, you jerk!
          
                conrad breaks down and cries.
          
                                    dr berger
                          it hurts to be mad at him, doesn't
                          it?
          
                                    conrad
                          yeah. he just wasn't careful. he
                          just wouldn't care. he didn't see
                          how a bad thing might happen.
          
                                    dr berger
                          bad things happen even when people
                          are careful.
          
                                    conrad
                          we were screwing around out there,
                          we should've come in when it
                          started to look bad.
          
                                    dr berger
                          ok, so you made a mistake.

                             have been stronger?
          
                conrad comes out of it and stares at him.
