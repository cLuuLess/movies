                            i will.
          
                                      beth
                                (casually)

                            though. you can go upstairs to that
                            room of yours and clean out the
                            closet.

                            okay? because it really is a mess.
          
               they stand there, facing each other, uptight. the telephone
               rings. beth goes over to it, picks it up, seems suddenly
               delighted.
          
                                         beth (cont'd)
                            hello. /.../
                            oh, hi! /.../
                            yeah, , no, i didn't get there. i
                            was swamped with work. how did it
                            go? /.../
                            no, no, i'm not doing anything,
                            just getting ready for dinner.
                            uh-huh.
          
               beth laughs to a gossip. conrad is devastated.
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
