               conrad seems to be day-dreaming, looking outside. female
               literature teacher questions about the character of jude in
               the story of jude the obscure, written by thomas hardy.
          
                                      teacher
                            how about we discuss some theory,
                            here? conrad, what's your theory on
                            jude fawley? conrad?
          
          
                                                                  (continued)

               conrad comes back to it
          
                                      teacher (cont'd)
                            what's your theory on jude fawley?
          
                                       conrad
                            uh...
          
                                      teacher
                            do you think he was powerless in
                            the grip of circumstances... or
                            could he have helped himself?
          
                                      conrad
                            i don't... uh...powerless? i guess he
                            thought he was, yeah.
          
                                      joel
                            the guy was a real jerk. he was
                            hung up on what was the moral thing
                            to do. it didn't make any sense.
          
                                      teacher
                            i think that's a little too easy,
                            joel. paul? what do you think?
          
                                      paul
                            i found the book hard to follow. i
                            couldn't figure it out.
