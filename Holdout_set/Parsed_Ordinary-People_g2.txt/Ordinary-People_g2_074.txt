          68   int. grandparents' kitchen Â­ day                           68
          
               [plate crashes]. we follow the grandmother going to the
               kitchen to see what's happening. with her, we discover beth
               kneeling, picking up a broken plate on the ground.
          
                                         grandmother
                            beth?!
          
                                      beth
                            i think it can be saved.
          
               beth gets up, goes to the table and starts preparing the
               sandwiches.
          
                                      beth (cont'd)
                            that was dumb. it was just so dumb.
                            i don't think he's happy in school.
          
                                      grandmother
                            have you talked to his teachers?
          
                                      beth
                            i don't think people want to be
                            with him. he provokes people.
          
                                      grandmother
                            well. / why don't you do this? /
                            it's an awkward age.
          
                                         beth
                            thank you.
          
                                      grandmother
                            maybe he needs a change. are you
                            sure he's eating enough?
          
                                      beth
                            yes, mother, of course.
          
                                      grandmother
                            i think he'll be all right - if
                            you're firm with him, mmm?
          
                                      beth
                            i think maybe he should go away to
                            school. i just don't know how to
                            deal with him any more.
          
                                      grandmother
                            who would make that decision?
          
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                    67.
          68   continued:                                                 68
          
          
                                      beth
                            i don't know. i suppose this doctor
                            he's seeing.
          
                                      grandmother
                            what sort of doctor... would make
                            that decision for you?
          
                                      beth
                            a psychiatrist.
          
                                      grandmother
                            i thought we were all finished with
                            that.
          
                                      beth
                            no...
          
                                      grandmother
                            what's his name?
          
                                      beth
                            berger.
          
                                      grandmother
                            jewish doctor?
          
                                      beth
                            i dunno, i suppose he's jewish.
                            maybe just german.
          
                                      grandmother
                            what does cal say about all this?
          
               beth shows her mother the two pieces of the plate and puts
               them together.
          
                                      beth
                            you know, i think this can be
                            saved. it's a nice clean break.
