               conrad sits in an armchair, very nervous, scratching his leg.
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)

                                      conrad
                            so what do i do... tell you my
                            dreams?
          
                                      dr berger
                            i don't hold much stock in dreams.
          
                                      conrad
                            what kind of a psychiatrist are
                            you? they all believe in dreams.
          
                                      dr berger
                            really? what's happening?
                            what's going on?
          
                                      conrad
                            i just feel... i feel so...
          
                                       dr berger
                            what?
          
                                      conrad
                            jumpy. i don't know.
          
                                      dr berger
                            look. kiddo... i lied. i do
                            believe in dreams. only sometimes i
                            want to know what's happening when
                            you're awake. come on, something's
                            bugging you, making you nervous.
                            you're making me nervous.
          
                                      conrad
                            maybe i need a tranquilizer.
          
                                      dr berger
                            tranquilizer?
          
                                       conrad
                            yeah.
          
               what do you think?
          
                                      dr berger
                            i think you came in here looking
                            like something out of the body
                            snatchers. it's not my impression
                            that you need a tranquilizer.
          
               conrad notices a cube on the table.
          
                                      conrad
                            what is this?
          
                                       dr berger
                            clock.

                                      conrad
                            oh, i see. so you get to tell the
                            time, but i can't. is that it?
          
                                        dr berger
                            mmm, mmm.
          
                                      conrad
                            so you know when the hour's up?
          
                                        dr berger
                            right.
          
                                      conrad
                            fifty minutes, fifty five minutes?
                            what is it?
          
               dr berger doesn't answer.
          
                                       conrad (cont'd)
                            maybe... maybe i don't want to swim
                            anymore. you know, i mean my timing
                            is for shit. you know, he's got two
                            guys that swim the fifty, they're
                            better than me, and...
          
                                        dr berger
                            ha, ha.
          
                                      conrad
                            they're a bunch of boring ass
                            jocks.

                                      conrad
                            and him... i can't stand him. he's
                            a tight ass son of a bitch!
          
                                       dr berger
                            ah, ah?... have you ever thought
                            about quitting?
          
                                      conrad
                            are you telling me to?
          
                                        dr berger
                            no.
          
                                      conrad
                            it wouldn't look good.
          
                                      dr berger
                            forget about how it looks! how does
                            it feel?
          
          
                                                                  (continued)

                                      conrad
                            how does it feel? how does it feel?
          
                                      dr berger
                            yes!
          
                                      conrad
                            how does it feel?!
          
                                      dr berger
                            yes! how does it feel?
          
                                        conrad
                            it's the same thing that happened
                            last year... it's the same damn
                            thing i did last year.
          
                                       dr berger
                            are you the same person you were
                            last year?
          
                                      conrad
                            i don't know!
          
                                      dr berger
                            that's why you need a tranquilizer?
          
                                      conrad
                            you tell me!
          
                                      dr berger
                            no. it's up to you!
          
                                      conrad
                            fifty bucks an hour, can't you
                            decide if i should have a pill or
                            not? i mean, you're a doctor, i'm
                            supposed to feel better! right?
          
                                      dr berger
                            not necessarily.
          
               conrad reflects.
          
                                      dr berger (cont'd)
                            how is it with your friends? is it
                            getting any easier?
          
                                      conrad
                            no. it's still hard.
          
                                      dr berger
                            is anyplace easy?
          
                                      conrad
                            the hospital was.
          
          
                                                                  (continued)

                                      conrad
                            because nobody hid anything there.

                            was there anyone there you could
