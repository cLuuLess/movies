               beth looks uptight and scornful. calvin notices it.
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                    39.
          51   continued:                                                 51
          
          
                                       calvin
                            hey?
          
                                      beth
                            you drink too much at parties,
                            calvin.
          
                                      calvin
                            i'm not drunk.
          
                                      beth
                            why did you tell annie marshall
                            that conrad is seeing a
                            psychiatrist?
          
                                      calvin
                            i dunno. why not?
          
                                      beth
                            well for one thing, i don't think
                            people hear that kind of thing very
                            easily.
          
                                      calvin
                            come on, for most people, it's a
                            status symbol, right up there with
                            going to europe.
          
                                      beth
                            well, i thought your blurting it
                            out like that was in very bad
                            taste...
          
                                      calvin
                            i did not think it was that...
          
                                      beth
                            not to mention a violation of
                            privacy!
          
                                      calvin
                            whose privacy?
          
               beth is strangely vehement.
          
                                      beth
                            our privacy! the family's privacy!
                            i think it is a very private
                            matter.
          
               calvin sighs.
