               calvin is lying back on the couch. beth is by his side, and
               talks to him seducingly.
          
          
          
                                                                   (continued)
          
                                                                     30.
          41   continued:                                                  41
          
          
                                      calvin
                            mmm?
          
                                      beth
                            that christmas in london would be
                            like something out of dickens.
                            we've never done that before,
                            right? christmas in london?
          
                                       calvin
                            maybe we shouldn't plan to go away
                            right now.
          
                                      beth
                            yes, we talked about that.   we
                            decided on that.
          
                                      calvin
                            yeah. i know we talked about it,
                            but the more i talk about it, the
                            more the timing doesn't seem right.
          
                                      beth
                                (interrupting)
                            calvin, we've always gone away at
                            christmas time.
          
                                      calvin
                            i know.
          
                                       beth
                            i think...  i think it would be good
                            for him too. isn't it time we got
                            back to normal?
          
                                      calvin
                            he's just started with this doctor.
          
                                      beth
                            alright, so he'll miss three weeks.
                            why interrupt it?
          
                                      beth (cont'd)
                            because i want to get away! i think
                            we all should. it's important.
          
                                      calvin
                            no. if he doesn't go through with
                            this now, he might change his mind.
          
                                      beth
                            alright then if he changes his
                            mind, maybe it's not something that
                            was right for him to do.
          
          
          
          
                                                                   (continued)
          
                                                                      31.
          41   continued:                                                   41
          
          
                                      calvin
                            you talked to him about it? does he
                            want to go to london?
          
                                      beth
                            i don't think he knows what he
                            wants to do.
