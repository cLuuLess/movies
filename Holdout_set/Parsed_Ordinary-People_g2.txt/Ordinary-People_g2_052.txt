               beth and calvin are going to the murray's birthday party,
               calvin is driving.
          
                                      calvin
                            who's gonna be there?
          
                                      beth
                            well. the murrays of course, and
                            the gunthers, and the caines, and...
                            the good old us.
          
                                      calvin
                            why don't we just go to the movies
                            instead?
          
                                      beth
                            don't be negative.
          
                                      calvin
                            that's not negative. that's
                            unpredictable.
                            come on. let's really go to the
                            movies.
          
                                       beth
                            okay.
          
               calvin smiles, thinking she agrees, not understanding she is
               taking this as a joke.
          
                                       calvin
                            really?
          
          
          
                                                                   (continued)
          
                                                                      34.

                                      beth
                            okay. yeah. come on. let's go.
                            what's our excuse?
          
                                      calvin
                            beth wanted to go to the movies?
          
                                      beth
                            good. very good.
          
               she laughs strangely.
