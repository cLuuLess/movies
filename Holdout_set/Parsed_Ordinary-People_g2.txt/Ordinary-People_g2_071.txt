                            jarrett.
          
               lazenby walks away to the others, waiting. they leave.
          
                                         stillman

                            shut up. leave it alone.
          
                                      stillman
                            i told you. the guy's a flake.
          
               they laugh. conrad, angry with himself, slams his locker's
               door.
