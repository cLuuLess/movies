              students' choir rehearsing canon in d by pachelbel (not
              originally written with lyrics). among many, conrad is
              singing. he is just behind jeannine pratt. they don't know
              each other yet.

                                together)
                           free from all the world's desires
                           free of fear and all anxiety
                           ooooh. ooooh
                           ooooh. ooooh
                           alleluia
                           alleluia
                           sing alleluia!
