                            could we talk about buck's funeral?

                            what?
          
                                      calvin
                            i know it'll seem trivial, but it's
                            on my mind, or has been, and i'd
                            just like to talk about it.
          
                                      beth
                            why?

                            when i was getting dressed for
                            buck's funeral, i was...
          
                                      beth
                            calvin, what's the matter with you?
          
                                      calvin
                            just let me get it off my chest,ok?
          
                                      beth
                            what could getting dressed for
                            buck's funeral possibly have to do
                            with anything right now?
          
                                      calvin
                            i was wearing a blue shirt. and
                            you said: - wear a white shirt and
                            the other shoes!
                            it was nothing at the time. but
                            it's always seemed to stay with
                            me. and i, for some reason, been
                            thinking about it and it suddenly
                            occured to me what difference did
                            it make what i wore at buck's
                            funeral?
          
                                      beth
                            ha, ha.
          
               beth retreats inside the house to the kitchen.
          
                                      calvin
                            just hear me out, beth! it won't
                            hurt you to listen!
          
                                      beth
                            i won't listen to that! no one in
                            their right mind would listen to
                            that.

                            i just want to talk about something
                            i always remembered.
          
                                      beth
                            why do you want to remind me of it?
          
                                      calvin
                            because i've always wondered, in
                            some needling way, what it mattered
                            what i wore. i was crazy that day.
                            we were going to our son's funeral.
                            and you were worried about what i
                            wore on my feet. i'm sure it
                            sounds like nothing to you, but
                            it sticks with me and i just
                            wanted to ...tell you about it.
          
               she comes to him and takes him into her arms.
          
                                      beth
                            it's all right.
