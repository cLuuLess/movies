                conrad cries
          
                                    conrad
                          i'm scared! i'm scared.
          
                                    dr berger
                          feelings are scary. and sometimes
                          they're painful. and if you can't
                          feel pain, then you're not gonna
                          feel anything else either. you know
                          what i'm saying?
          
                                    conrad
                          i think so.
          
                                    dr berger
                          you're here and you're alive. and
                          don't tell me you don't feel that.
          
                                    conrad
                          it doesn't feel good.
          
                                    dr berger
                          it is good. believe me.
          
                                    conrad
                          how do you know?
          
                                    dr berger
                          because i'm your friend.

                                                                    115.

                conrad is out of breath.
          
                                       conrad
                             i don't know what i would've
                             done...if you hadn't been here.
                             you're really my friend?
          
                                       dr berger
                             i am. count on it.
          
                conrad falls into dr berger's arms, crying.
