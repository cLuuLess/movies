                beth enters the dining room in the dark.
          
                                          beth
                             calvin?
          
                calvin is sitting at table in the dark, sobbing, his head in
                his hands.
          
                                       beth (cont'd)
                             why are you crying?
          
                calvin doesn't answer.
          
                                        beth (cont'd)
                             can i, uh... can i get you
                             something?
          
                calvin mutters in a very low voice.
          
                                          calvin
                             i don't...
          
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                    122.
          156   continued:                                                 156
          
          
                                       beth
                             what did you say?
          
                calvin sits back in his chair.
          
                                       beth (cont'd)
                             calvin. what did you say?
          
                calvin produces a very deep sigh.
          
                                        beth (cont'd)
                             tell me.
          
                calvin looks up at her with a sad expression.
          
                                       calvin
                             you are beautiful. and you are
                             unpredictable. but you're so
                             cautious. you're determined, beth.
                             but you know something? you're not
                             strong. and i don't know if you're
                             really giving. beth is looking at
                             him not knowing what this is about.
          
                                       calvin (cont'd)
                             tell me something. do you love me?
                             do you really love me?
          
                                        beth
                             i feel the way i've always felt
                             about you.
          
                calvin is disappointed by the answer, but not surprised, just
                sad.
          
                                       calvin
                             we would've been all right, if
                             there hadn't been any ...mess.
                             but you can't handle mess.
                             you need everything neat and
                             ...easy.
                             i don't know. maybe you can't
                             love anybody. it was so much
                             buck. and buck died, it was as if
                             you buried all your love with
                             him, and i don't understand that.
                             i just don't know.
          
                calvin sighs.
          
                                       calvin (cont'd)
                             maybe it wasn't even buck.
                             maybe it was just you.
                             maybe, finally, it was the best
                             of you that you buried.

                                                                   (continued)
          
                                                                    123.
          156   continued:                                                 156
                                       calvin (cont'd)
                             but whatever it was, i don't know
                             who you are.
                             i don't know what we've been
                             playing at.
                             so i was crying.
          
                calvin is overcome by sadness
          
                                       calvin (cont'd)
                             't know if i love you anymore. and
                             i don't know what i am going to do
                             without that.
          
                beth does not know what to say or do. she turns away and goes
                upstairs.
