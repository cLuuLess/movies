          4   int. theater play - on stage    - night                       4
          
              a man of fifty is holding his wife's hand over the breakfast
              table.
          
                                     man
                           do you know we've made love one
                           hundred and thirteen times?
          
              we hear laughter (numerous).
          
                                     man (cont'd)
                           i figured it out on my bowmar
                           calculator.
          
          
          
                                                                (continued)
          
                                                                      5.
          4   continued:                                                   4
          
          
              laughter again. the man and the woman are two actors on stage
              of the local theater. a very conventional play. the set
              represents an average american kitchen. a man and a woman are
              having coffee. man is holding woman's hand.
          
              we gradually discover the audience of the theater.
          
                                     man (cont'd)
                           to know someone that well is a
                           wonderful thing.
          
              pause
          
                                        man (cont'd)
                           two lumps?
          
              [ close in on two couples in the audience] beth and calvin
              and their friends. the women are amused, the men trying to
              keep awake.
          
                                        woman
                           no, one.
          
                                     man
                           so i don't know everything about
                           you. i don't know your favorite
                           movie stars. i can't remember the
                           name of your favorite perfume. i
                           have racked my brain and i can't
                           remember.
          
                                     woman
                           that's funny. it's "my sin."
          
              audience laughs, alvin wakes up and behaves. gives a
              conventional smile to his wife beth.
          
                                     man
                           but i do know, in the last twenty
                           four years, that i have never been
                           out of love with you.
