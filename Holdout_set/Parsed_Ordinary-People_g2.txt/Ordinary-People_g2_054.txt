                                         man #3
                            i wouldn't do that,      i wouldn't
                            do it now...
          
                                        murray

                            your cigar?" and he says: "huh?". i
                            said: "would you put out your
                            cigar?", he says: "huh?". i said:
                            "would you please put out your

                            it's a macho factor. when these
                            kids are at school, they just think
                            they've got to walk on the edge of
                            danger.
