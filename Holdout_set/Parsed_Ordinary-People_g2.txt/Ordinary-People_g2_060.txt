               beth is laughing at buck story. she is lying leisurely on a
               mattress on the lawn. buck is standing, telling his story.
          
                                      buck
                            oh anyway, mary ann ramon started
                            to just scream, just cry, right?
                            it was crazy. we got so drunk
                            that we couldn't talk to each
                            other. it was the last day... the
                            last day of school.
          
               a younger conrad, sitting aside, is listening too, amused.
          
                                      buck (cont'd)
                            we walked out of the building in
                            the middle of the class!
          
               conrad laughs. beth laughs.
          
                                         beth
                            oh, bucky!
          
               beth laughs.
