               calvin walks with his business partner ray hanley (seen at
               the party).
          
                                      ray hanley
                            well. at least she's an
                            improvement. she doesn't crack gum
                            in your face. that's what you get
                            when your partner does the hiring
                            and firing.
          
                                      calvin
                            oh, i'm sorry. that's my fault.
                            i just can never seem to tell
                            anybody that they're not making
                            it.
          
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                    54.

                                      ray hanley
                            hold, hold it. wait a minute.
                            that's not the problem.
                            where are you?
          
                                      calvin
                            what?
          
                                      ray hanley
                            i've been losing you these days.
          
                                      calvin
                            oh, i'm sorry.
          
                                       ray hanley
                            that's okay. that's okay. you off
                            the track?
          
                                      calvin
                            huh?
          
               they laugh.
          
                                      ray hanley
                            come on. i've known you for twenty
                            years. you think i can't tell when
                            something's wrong? how's connie?
          
                                      calvin
                            connie's all right. he is. he's
                            okay.
          
                                      ray hanley
                            look, i am sorry, it's none of my
                            business, but i think you worry too
                            much. you've been on the rack about
                            him long enough. you're making it a
                            habit. you've gotta let him go
                            sometime.
          
                                      calvin
                            i'm not on the rack about him.
          
                                      ray hanley
                            the thing about it is, in a year
                            he'll be gone. off to michigan or
                            harvard or wherever in the hell he
                            gets it in his head he wants to go.
                            maybe he'll decide to take a tour
                            of europe for a year and not even
                            go to school at all. who knows?
          
                                      calvin
                            i can't argue with "who knows."
          
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)

                                      ray hanley
                            i'm just try giving you the benefit
                            of my experience.
          
                                       calvin
                            thanks.

                            with valerie, it's more than her
                            living away from home... she's
                            gone. got her own friends, her own
                            life. she breezes in ...for a couple
                            of days on vacations, but... i don't
                            know, maybe girls are different.
                            or maybe she was too aware of what
                            was happening between nance and me.
                            but they leave... and all that
                            worrying doesn't amount to a hill
                            of crap. it's just wasted energy.
          
               calvin is troubled.
