27       int. vogon constructor bridge - continuous                        27

         arthur and ford are strapped against two concrete pillars
         with hundreds of elastic bands.

         a strange and lethal looking device descends from the
         ceiling. looks like an instrument of torture. as the
         device descends, jeltz fishes a jeweled crab out of a
         gunky trough and smashes it with a hammer -- blam!

         jeltz takes the device in his hand -- then blows in it.
         we hear feedback. it's a microphone (like ones used to
         introduce boxers). he taps it. this thing on? it is.
         he faces them, holds up a book entitled... "       " --
         smirks, then begins to read vogon poetry.

                              jeltz
                      oh freddled gruntbuggly!
                      thy suppurations are to me as plerdled
                      gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.

         ford writhes in pain, as does arthur but less so.

                     vogon poetry is widely accepted as the
                     third worst in the universe.

        ford vibrates like he's having an epileptic seizure.
        arthur just looks like he has a migraine.

                             guide voice (cont'd)
                     the second worst is that of the azgoths of
                     kria. during a recitation by their poet
                     master grunthos the flatulent of his poem
                     "ode to a small lump of green putty i found
                     in my armpit one midsummer morning," four
                     of his audience died of internal
                     hemorrhaging, and the president of the mid-
                     galactic arts nobbling council survived by
                     gnawing one of his own legs off.

        spasms wrack ford's body.    he screams.     arthur squints.

                             jeltz
                     or i shall rend thee in the gobberwarts
                     with my blurglecruncheaon, see if i don't!

        ford's entire body tenses, arches, then goes limp.
        arthur lets out an audible sigh as the poem ends.

                             guide voice
                     the absolute worst poetry was written by
                     paula nancy millstone jennings of sussix.
                     it involved decaying swans. luckily, it
                     was destroyed when the earth was.

                                         jeltz
                     so, earthlings, i present you with a
                     simple choice. either die in the vacuum
                     of space, or -- tell what you thought of
                     my poem.

        ford is spent, can't say a word. arthur looks up.

                             arthur
                     actually...i rather liked it.

        jeltz looks surprised. ford notices, whispers to arthur.

                             ford
                     good tact. run with it.

                             arthur
                     um...some of the words i didn't understand,
                     but i found the imagery quite effective.

                  and, um, interesting rhythmic devices which
                  seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of
                  the underlying metaphor of the humanity...

                          ford
                  vogonity!

                           arthur
                  ... vogonity, sorry. vogonity of the poet's
                  soul, which contrives through the medium
                  of the verse structure to sublimate, er...

                          ford
                  ... whatever it was ...

                          arthur
                  ... the poem was about.

        jeltz rubs one of his chins, then smiles and claps slowly.

                             ford
                  damn.

                             arthur
                  what?

                          ford
                  i think you just saved my life again.

                          jeltz
                  an astute analysis. very impressive.
                     (turning to the guard)
                  throw them off the ship.

        the guard grabs them, drags them out of the bridge.

                          vogon guard
                  resistance is useless!

                           jeltz
                  hmph. "counterpoint the surrealism of the
                  underlying metaphor..." death's too good
                  for them.

        jeltz picks up his fishing rod, goes for another crab.
