    2   int. heart of gold. bridge - night                             32

32a     close on a monitor -- on which plays a news report.            32a

                          reporter (on tv)
                  ...and of course, the top story is still
                  the sensational theft of the new
                  improbability drive prototype ship heart of
                  gold last week, stolen at the launch
                  ceremony by none other than galactic
                  president zaphod beeblebrox.

                          zaphod (on tv)
                  so, in the name of the people and freedom
                  and, i dunno, democracy and stuff like
                  that, i hereby declare this ship
                  officially stolen!

        pull back to reveal zaphod beeblebrox, leaning toward the
        tv, watching with a very satisfied grin...

                          female voice (o.s.)
                  three to one...two to one...

        annoyed, he turns. there's a woman with red hair
        (trillian), her back to him, reading numbers off a
        console display and speaking into a microphone.

                          trillian
                     (into microphone)
                  probability factor of one to one...we have
                  normality, i repeat we have normality.
                  anything you still can't cope with is
                  therefore your own problem. please relax.
                  you will be sent for soon.

                            zaphod
                   hey.   do you mind?   i can't hear.

        trillian turns -- and we now recognize her as tricia from
        the fancy dress party. her hair is shorter and bright
        red. she looks amazing.

                           trillian
                   can we put your ego aside for one moment?
                   something important has happened.

                           zaphod
                   if there's anything more important than my
                   ego on this ship, i want it caught and
                   shot now.

        he turns back to the tv and turns it up.

                           reporter (ok tv)
                   ...the question everyone seems to be
                   asking is, has the big z finally flipped?
                   we asked his private brain care
                   specialist, gag halfrunt...

                           gag halfrrunt
                   vell, zaphod's just zis guy, you know --

        the tv suddenly clicks off.    zaphod spins.    trillian's
        holding a remote.

                            zaphod
                  hey...

                          trillian
                  we have a couple of hitchhikers in our
                  receiving bay.

        his head jerks upwards. he quickly grabs it with his
        hands and shoves it back down.

                          trillian (cont'd)
                  i didn't pick them up. the ship did.

                            zaphod
                  huh?

                          trillian
                  when you engaged the improbability drive.

                          zaphod
                  i didn't engage the drive.

                          trillian
                  we picked them up in sector zz9 plural z
                  alpha -- where you picked me up.

                          zaphod
                  that's impossible.

                            trillian
                  no.    just very, very improbable.

                           zaphod
                  i don't have time for this! we've got the
                  police of half the galaxy after us and we
                  stop to pick up hitchhikers?! okay, so
                  ten out of ten for style, but minus
                  several million for good thinking, eh?

        he reaches for a hi-tech gun on the wall.      she stops him.

                          trillian
                  don't. i'll send marvin. (calling)
                  marvin!

        zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its
        seat behind them. this is marvin. he trudges slump-
        shouldered toward zaphod.

                          marvin
                  i think you ought to know i'm feeling very
                  depressed.

                          trillian
                  we have something to take your mind off
                  things.

                          marvin
                  it won't work, i have an exceptionally
                  large mind.

                          trillian
                  i know. go down to the number two entry
                  bay and bring the two aliens up here.

                          marvin
                  just that?

                          trillian
                  yes.

                          marvin
                  i won't enjoy it.

                          zaphod
                  she's not asking you to enjoy it. just do
                  it will you?

                          marvin
                  all right. i'll do it.

        marvin turns and trudges away. then he turns again.

                          marvin (cont'd)
                  i'm not getting you down at all am i?

                          trillian
                  no, no, marvin, it's fine really. it's just
                  part of life.

                           marvin
                  life.   don't talk to me about life.

        marvin trudges away. a door slides open for him and
        makes an audible, satisfied sigh as it does.

                          door
                  mmmmmyaaahhhhhh!
