11    ext. street outside the pub - mid-day                         11

      arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being
      bulldozed. ford strides casually behind in the distance.

                            arthur
                   stop!   stop, you bastards!!

      arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we
      hear the loudest rumble in motion picture history.

11a   a gigantic yellow spaceship (picture a concrete tower         11a
      block)) sweeps overhead. ford hits the deck. arthur is
      blown sideways. trees are uprooted.

      ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was arthur's
      house. he digs around near the exposed toilet and comes
      up with -- a towel. he hurries to arthur's side.

         another ship screams over, blowing them down again. rain
         is knocked out of the clouds and lands in one big thwump!
         everywhere is soaked.

                              arthur (cont'd}
                      what the hell are those things?!

                              ford
                      ships from a vogon constructor fleet. i
                      picked up their signal this morning.

         he shows arthur his blinking sens-0-matic device.

                               ford {cont'd}
                      here.   you'll need this.

         he tosses arthur the towel. then, he removes a short
         black rod, his electronic thumb. he sticks it out.
