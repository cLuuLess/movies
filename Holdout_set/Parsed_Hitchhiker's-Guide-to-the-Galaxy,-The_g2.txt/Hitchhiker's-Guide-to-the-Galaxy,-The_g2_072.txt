        it coalesces back into shape out of chaos. the safety
        dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact
        same place they were - dazed.

                           zaphod
                   um...where are we?

                           trillian
                   exactly where we were, i think.

                           zaphod

                           ford
                   have apparently turned into a bowl of
                   petunias and a very surprised looking

                   thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to
                   one against.

        they all look to arthur who shrugs. zaphod nods his
        approval. ford counts on his fingers -- are they even?

        he waves it off, gives arthur a little salute and moves
        on. trillian looks to arthur and musters a smile.

                          arthur
                  i could really use a cup of tea.
