6   int. village pub - midday                                             6

    ford and arthur enter the half-full pub. ford hurries to
    the bar. arthur follows, cell phone to his ear.

                      ford
              six pints of bitter. and quickly.      the
              world's about to end.

                       barman
               oh yes, sir? nice weather for it.

    he starts to pull pints. ford shoves bar peanuts into
    his pockets while arthur shouts into his phone...

                      arthur
              well, when does he get back from lunch?
              or is he going straight out for tea?!

    he shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn.

                      arthur (cont'd)
              this is shaping up to be a crap day.

                         ford
                 it's about to get a lot crappier.

                         barman
                 there you are, six pints.

    ford slaps down a Â£50 note. the barman's impressed.

                         ford
                 keep the change. you've got ten minutes to
                 spend it.

    ford pushes three pints in front of arthur.

                         arthur
                 three? at lunchtime?

                         ford
                 time is an illusion. lunchtime doubly so.

                         arthur
                 very deep. you should send that in to the
                 reader's digest. they've got a page for
                 people like you.

                         ford
                 drink up.

                         arthur
                 why three pints?

                         ford
                 muscle relaxant.
                    (grabbing more peanuts)
                 and eat these. you'll need the salt.

                         arthur
                 what's going on. ford?

                         ford
                 what would you say if i told you i wasn't
                 really from guilford but from a small
                 planet somewhere in the vicinity of
                 eetelgeuse?

                         arthur
                 why, is it the sort of thing you're likely
                 to say?

                         ford
                 remember when we met? that car was racing
                 toward me, i was trying to greet it, you
                 pushed me out of the way?

         quick cut to a street - mid-day                                  7

         ford stands in the middle of the road, extending a hand
         to a fast approaching car.
         arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him
         out of the way as the car zooms past.

(6 cont) back to ford in the pub:                                      (6 cont)

                           ford
                   didn't you find it a little strange that i
                   was trying to shake hands with a car?

                           arthur
                   i assumed you were drunk.

                           ford
                      (shaking his head)
                   i thought cars were the dominant life
                   form. i was trying to introduce myself.

                           arthur
                   and that's why you're named after a
                   discontinued car from the seventies?

                           ford
                      (nodding)
                   you saved my life that day.      now i'm
                   saving yours.

         arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer.

                           arthur
                   this must be thursday. i never could get
                   the hang of thursdays.

                           ford
                   look, if it's about your house...

                           arthur
                   no, it's not that.    it's....

         he shows ford the photo of he and tricia on his phone.

                           arthur (cont'd)
                   i found her. ford. the perfect girl. i
                   found her, and then i let her get away.
                   you remember that fancy dress party i told
                   you about?

                           ford
                   this isn't a long story, is it? we've
                   only got six minutes.

         arthur shakes his head.    ford checks his watch.

              okay.     talk and drink. fancy dress party.


                      arthur
              at that flat in islington. i told you
              about it. last week, remember?
