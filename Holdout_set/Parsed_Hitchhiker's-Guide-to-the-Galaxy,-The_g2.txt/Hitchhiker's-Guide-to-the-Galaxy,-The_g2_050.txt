    1   int. humma kavula's room -- later                           61

        zaphod's head hangs on the wall. wires feed out of the
        neck into a huge machine.
        beneath the head is a crude drawing of a body and the
        words "i'm with stupid." an arrow points to zaphod's
        head 2 -- which is shouting...

                           zaphod head 2
                   idiot! zarking moron!! come back!! you
                   need me!! come baaaaackkkk!!!!

                           humma kavula
                   you should quit while you're "a head"
                   zaphod. no one has ever got passed the
                   magrathean defence system alive.

        humma laughs maniacally.
