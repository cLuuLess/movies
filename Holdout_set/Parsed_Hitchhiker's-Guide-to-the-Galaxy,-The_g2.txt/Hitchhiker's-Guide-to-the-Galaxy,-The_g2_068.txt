         they're all getting buckled into their seats.

                        (back to his normal voice)
                     hi, fellas. hold on to your hats!

                              zaphod
                     eddie!   welcome back!

        the ship suddenly blasts forward. their heads are
        slammed back into the seats as they vibrate violently.

                             ford
                     what's happening, zaphod?!   where did you
                     tell it to go?!

                             zaphod
                     i didn't say anything!

        arthur looks to the console and sees the two mice sliding
        across it, getting thrown across the ship. they continue
        to vibrate -- even more violently.

                             ford
                     are you sure we reattached this thing the
                     right way?!

        zaphod is all smiles, hanging on as if he were on a
        rollercoaster ride.

                             zaphod
                     isn't it great?!

82      deep space--                                                   82

        ...the h.o.g. is but a blur as it streaks along.

83      back in the h.o.g. - later                                     83

        stars appear on the screen as they slow from hyperspace.

                             eddie
                     guys, i'm just super happy to tell you
                     we're approaching hyperspace exit gamma
                     z8b530.

        arthur steadies himself, turns to trillian who's still
        staring forward, angry. she unbuckles her seat-belt and
        moves away from the console.

        a planet appears on screen.     zaphod and ford lean
        forward.

                             zaphod
                     okay, that's it...i think. computer?      is
                     that...where are we headed again?

                     hang on, fella, and i'll check.

        arthur turns, look over at...

        trillian -- who stares out a portal window into the
        emptiness of space. a tear rolls down her cheek.

        arthur steps up, isn't sure what to say.

                             arthur
                     look, you're right. you deserved to know
                     and i should've told you. i don't blame
                     you if you're angry.

        she turns and stares, wipes the tears away.     can't speak.

                              arthur (cont'd)
                     right.   anyway...i'm sorry.

                             eddie (o.s.)
                     guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you
                     we are currently in orbit at an altitude
                     of three hundred miles around the
                     legendary planet of magrathea. goll-ee.

        hearing this news, arthur, trillian and ford turn.

                          zaphod
                       (tasting it)
                     take us in.

83a     ext. night deep space - magrathea                              83a

        they all stare in awe as they move toward a planet which
        gets closer and closer. suddenly, their faces are awash
        with light.

        two suns rise behind the planet.     it's breathtaking.

                             zaphod
                     the twin suns of soulianis and rahm...

        marvin (both arms in tact) rises in the back, peers out.

                             marvin
                     it's rubbish.

83b     suddenly,a ghostly white swirl of light, vaguely in the        83b
        shape of a man, appears on the screen before them.

                             ghostly image
                     greetings. this is a recorded announcement
                     as we're all out the moment. the commercial
                     council of magrathea thanks you for your
                     esteemed visit, but regrets that the entire
                     planet is temporarily closed for business.
                     if you would like to leave your name and a
                     planet where you can be contacted, kindly
                     do so at the tone.

        beep.   then stunned silence.

                              arthur
                      closed? how can a planet be closed?

                               zaphod
                      for once, aldus, i agree with you. okay,
                      computer. keep going. take us down.

                              eddie
                      happy to!

         the ship eases forward. the image appears again.

                              ghostly image
                      it is most gratifying that your enthusiasm
                      for our planet continues unabated.    as a
                      token of our appreciation, we hope you
                      will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles
                      we've just sent to converge with your
                      craft. to ensure on-going quality of
                      service, your death may be monitored for
                      training purposes. thank you.

         the image vanishes. a beat.    then...

                              eddie
                      guys, i'm delighted to tell you there are
                      two thermonuclear missiles headed right
                      for us. should i take evasive action?

83c      the screens show two huge rockets thundering at us,               83c
         zaphod just smiles. ford steps up.

                              ford
                      um...yes, computer.   evade!

         massive acceleration! an illuminated dome lowers from the
         ceiling over the crew seats - creating a safety pod.
