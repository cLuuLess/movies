        pull back from juke box.     the pub seems deserted.

                    what do you mean you've never been to
                    alpha centauri? oh, for heaven's sake
                    mankind, it's only four light years away
                    you know. i'm sorry, but if you can't be
                    bothered to take an interest in local
                    affairs that's your own lookout.

        pull back farther - people lay on the ground with paper
        bags on their heads.
