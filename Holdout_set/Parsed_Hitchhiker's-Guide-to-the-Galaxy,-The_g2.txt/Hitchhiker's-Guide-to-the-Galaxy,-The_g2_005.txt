8   int. islington flat - night                                     8

    crowded flat.    everyone is in costume.   loud music blares.

                       arthur (v.o.)
               i can't bear those sort of parties, didn't
               want to go, would have much rather stayed
               home and, i don't know, brush the dog.
               anything. but there i was -- and then,
               there she was...

    arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet,
    sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable.

                       tricia (o.s.)
               who are you?

    arthur looks up. tricia mcmillan is dressed in a mid
    19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is
    holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks
    beautiful.   arthur, ever the gentleman, stands.

                       arthur
               i'm arthur. arthur dent.

                       tricia
               no, i mean who are you?

                       arthur
               oh, the costume. right. er, um...
                  (sheepishly tipping his hat)
               livingston, i presume.
                   (pointing to her attire)
               granted. not as clever as darwin, but the
               best i could do on short notice.

                       tricia
               you're the first person who's got it
               right. everyone keeps calling me
               sherlock.

                      arthur
              really? i thought the beagle made it
              rather obvious.

    he pets the dog.    she smiles.    he smiles back.

9   a camera flash flashes.    jump cut to...                     9

    the balcony -- arthur has just taken a digital photo of
    he and tricia on his cell phone. they look at the screen
    image and laugh.

                         arthur (v.o.) (cont'd)
                 she was amazing, ford. witty, and
                 beautiful, and brilliant. four or five
                 degrees. one in math, one in astrophysics,
                 another in biology...

                         tricia
                 i've got so many degrees i am officially
                 unemployable. let's drink to that!

    they clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat.

                         arthur (v.o.)
                 and just as i was asking myself, "why is
                 this stunning and intelligent woman even
                 giving me the time of day, out of nowhere
                 she says...

                         tricia
                 let's go somewhere.

                         arthur
                 yeah. it is a bit noisy. there's a
                 lovely little cafe around the corner...

                         tricia
                 i was thinking madagascar.

                         arthur
                 is that a new club on dean street?

                         tricia
                 no. it's a country.    off the coast of
                 africa.

                         arthur
                 oh, that madagascar. right, off we go
                 then.
                    (then realizing...)
                 good god, you're serious.

     she nods.    arthur isn't sure how to react.

                          arthur (cont'd)
                  well...that's...an extraordinary
                  proposition. but...i can't just up and
                  go. what about my job?

                           tricia
                  quit.   get a new one when we return.

                          arthur
                  i can't just...what about my house?     who
                  would feed my dog?

                          tricia
                  bring him with.

                          arthur
                  he's a welsh collie.   he'd feel all out of
                  place in madagascar.

     trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed.

                          zaphod (o.s.)
                  you don't want to go to madagascar.

     they both turn to face zaphod beeblebrox - very charming,
     extremely handsome - whose attire seems very "other
     worldly." knee high boots, a yellow sash...

                          zaphod (cont'd)
                  hi. i'm zaphod beeblebrox, president of
                  the galaxy -- of course, you probably
                  already know that. i'm headed for a lost
                  and distant planet. would you like to see
                  my spaceship?

                          arthur (v.o.)
                  i went to refresh our drinks.     when i came
                  back, she was gone.
