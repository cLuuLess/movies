        they sit, panting.    arthur stares forward.

                           arthur
                   so this is it? we're going to die?

                             ford
                     yes. no, wait! what's this switch?
                        (reaching for it)
                     no, it's nothing. we are going to die.

        arthur sits for a moment, then oddly chuckles to himself.

                             arthur
                     you know, it's at times like this, when
                     i'm trapped in a vogon airlock with a man
                     from betelgeuse and about to die of
                     asphyxiation in deep space that i really
                     wish i'd listened to what my mother told
                     me when i was young.

                             ford
                     why? what did you she tell you?

                             arthur
                     i don't know. i didn't listen.

        ford folds his towel into a tiny square, holds it up
        toward arthur. he raises an eyebrow. will this help?

                             ford
                     you're sweating.

        ford dabs arthur's brow. they stare forward at the
        airlock door. long pause. nothing happens. they look
        to each other. shrug. they might be okay. then --
        pssh. the bottom drops out. they're sucked down and out.
