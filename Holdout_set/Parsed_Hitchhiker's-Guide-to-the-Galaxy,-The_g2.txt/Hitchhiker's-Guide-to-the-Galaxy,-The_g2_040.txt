        zaphod hits eject.    the blue cube rises.

                          ford
                  that's it?

                          zaphod
                  that's it.

                          ford
                  you're looking for the ultimate question?

                             zaphod
                  yep.

                             ford
                  you.

                             zaphod
                  me.

                             ford
                  why?

                          zaphod
                  no, i tried that. "why?" "forty-two."
                  doesn't work.
                     (to trillian)
                  let's get her ready, babe.

        he moves to a different rack of instruments, consults a
        check list, starts flipping some switches.

                          ford
                  i mean, why do you want to know the
                  ultimate question?

                          zaphod
                  oh. well -- partly the curiosity, partly
                  a sense of adventure, but mostly i think
                  it's for the fame and the money.

        he continues preparing the ship. trillian consults the
        huge manual, turning dials, flipping switches...

                          arthur
                  but -- you're president of the galaxy,
                  aren't you?

                          zaphod
                  yes, arman.

                             arthur
                  arthur.

                           zaphod
                  whatever. presidential fame is temporary,
                  i find the question, that's permanent. it
                  sticks. plus everyone thinks you're deep.
                  win-win.

                             ford
                     but you don't know the name of the
                     computer that other computer was talking
                     about.

                             zaphod
                     which is why i'm going there.

                              ford
                     where?

                             zaphod
                     there. to find deep thought.    on
                     magrathea.

                             ford
                     magrathea!? magrathea is a myth, a
                     legend...

                             zaphod
                     no, it isn't. it's real, cousin. and this
                     is the only ship in the universe that can
                     get you there.

                             ford
                        (realizing)
                     you mean to tell me you carved up your
                     brain so you could become president so you
                     would get invited to the launching
                     ceremony of this ship...so you could steal
                     it... so you could go to magrathea --
                     which, according to most sane people,
                     doesn't even exist?

                              zaphod
                     yep.

                             ford
                     beautiful.

                             arthur
                     why this ship? what's so special about
                     it?

        zaphod thinks again -- hard.

                             zaphod
                     i don't seem to be letting myself in on
                     any of my secrets.

                             trillian (o.s.)
                     because of this, obviously.

        they turn to see trillian flipping open a glass lid
        revealing a big red button. ford reads the glowing
        letters above the button...

                     (reading)
                  infinite improbability drive?       so they
                  finally built one that works.       and that's
                  how we got picked up.

                          zaphod
                  exactly. and i'm guessing if we hit that
                  button -- we go to magrathea.

                          arthur
                  you're guessing?

                          zaphod
                  hey, anyone who's not up for that, there's
                  the door. now who's in?

                          ford
                  for a trip to a place that doesn't exist?
                  i'm in. my editor will think i'm crazy,
                  but what the hell -- he already thinks i'm
                  dead.

        he takes out the guide.       zaphod looks to trillian.

                          trillian
                  definitely. i'm in.

        they're all standing together. they turn to arthur.
        arthur looks to trillian. she stares back -- waiting.

                          arthur
                  do i even have a choice?

        zaphod smiles, all bright and cheery.

                             zaphod
                  no!

        arthur looks at the button.

                          arthur
                  what exactly does an infinite
                  improbability drive do?

        suddenly, zaphod's head 2 shoots up!

                             zaphod head 2
                  this!!

        zaphod's third arm shoots out and smacks the button.
