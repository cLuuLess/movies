                    what they want--

         he pulls out his gun up and fires back.

                            zaphod (cont'd)
                    hey! let's do lunch! nice haircut, fella!

         with each line he fires. ford grabs him. shots hit a
         stack of aerosol cans. they explode. more mist rises.

         the gang run down an alley and hide behind a kiosk.
         zaphod sports a goofy smile. arthur is scared to death.

                    oh god, i really hate thursdays.

                    he holds up two peace signs, a la nixon.

                               arthur
                    what?

                            ford
                    i think that was his campaign slogan.

         trillian finds a deodorant can, grabs it, gets an idea.

                            trillian
                    alright, follow me.
               she aims the can at zaphod's ear- arthur's face registers
               the madness of the moment.

(62 cont) the police step backwards -- but the crowd takes a step       (62 cont)
          forward. a huddle of female admirers rush them, waving
          pens and paper as if the beatles have arrived.

            zaphod paints on a smile, breaks away from the others to
            go sign a few autographs.

            shots are fired. the crowd screams and scatters. arthur
            reaches for trillian but she is engulfed by vogons who
            move, en masse, and pull her away into the mist.

            ford, with zaphod in tow, shoves arthur forward, using
            his towel to clear a path through the mist. they see the

            usher trillian, in futuristic hand-cuffs, past the vogon
