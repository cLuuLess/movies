        vogon crew quickly enter data. a flight engineer gets
        something on his screen, shows it to the captain.

                             vogon captain
                     sir, the heart of gold has just requested
                     permission to land on viltvodle 6. should
                     i pursue?

                             kwaltz (on monitor)
                     that is not a request to which i can
                     respond, captain. should i pursue what?
                     are you requesting hyperspace clearance so
                     that you may pursue the fugitive?

                             vogon captain
                     yes, commander.

                             kwaltz (on monitor)
                     then you must say that, captain -- in
                     request form.

                             vogon captain
                     requesting hyperspace clearance to pursue
                     the fugitive, sir.
