        jeltz consults one screen after another. at last he sees
        ford and arthur. his walrusy eyes narrow.

25      back in the sleeping quarters - minutes later               25

                           arthur
                   blown up? blown up?! couldn't you have
                   done something?!!

                            ford
                   i did.   i saved you.

                             arthur
                     but there's six billion other people.

                             ford
                     and all those ants.

                             arthur
                     yes, but ants aren't exactly people!

                             ford
                     and now you're thinking like a vogon.
                        (before arthur can respond)
                     i saved your life, okay? which makes us
                     even. next thing.

        ford throws arthur a towel. arthur looks confused.

                              ford (cont'd)
                      it's a tough galaxy. you want to survive
                      out here, you really gotta know where your
                      towel is. now gimme a hand over here.

        arthur joins ford near a rusty ventilation pipe.

                              ford (cont'd)
                      careful, it's hot.

        he slides the towel behind the pipe, holding each end of
        it, arthur does the same.

                              ford (cont'd)
                      we've got to get off this ship before the
                      vogons find us. vogons hate hitchhikers.
                      which is why they make ships with walls
                      that won't allow the sub-etna signal to
                      pass through. so we've got to send the
                      signal up and out if we wanna catch a
                      ride. pull.

        they both pull. a section of pipe snaps off. steam
        shoots out. ford holds the black thumb under the pipe.

                             arthur
                     what's a vogon?

                             ford
                     ask the guide.    say "vogons."

        ford continues turning dials.        arthur lifts the guide.

                             arthur
                     "vogons."

        the word "vogons" floats up into his field of vision.

        character, history, how to have fun with, how to annoy,
        what to avoid. arthur touches character.

                          guide voice (cont'd)
                  vogons are one of the most unpleasant
                  races in the galaxy - not evil, but bad-
                  tempered, bureaucratic, officious and
                  callous. they wouldn't even lift a finger
                  to save their own grandmothers from the
                  ravenous bugblatter beast of traal without
                  orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent
                  back, queried, lost, found, subjected to
                  public inquiry, lost again, and finally
                  buried in soft peat for three months and
                  recycled as fire-lighters.

        arthur touches 'how to have fun with.'

                          guide voice (cont'd)
                  the best way to get a drink out of a vogon
                  is to stick your finger down his throat.

        arthur touches 'what to avoid'.

                          guide voice (cont'd)
                  on no account should you allow a vogon to
                  read poetry to you.

                           ford
                  they can't think, they can't imagine, most
                  of them can't even spell. they just run
                  things.
                         (turns dial opposite direction)
                  and if we don't get a ride soon, you won't
                  b need the guide to illustrate just how
                  unpleasant the vogons can be.
                  they've destroyed a planet today, that
                  always makes them a little feisty.

                          arthur
                  it can't be gone. it can't be!

                  that's it? that's all this idiotic book
                  has to say about my home? "harmless?"

                  hey, there are a hundred billion stars in
                  the galaxy and only a limited amount of
                  space in the book's microprocessors. no
                  one knew much about earth. that's why i
                  was there. to expand the entry. i fired
                  off a new one to the editor before i got
                  stranded.

                  mostly harmless.

        before arthur can react, a speaker hums to life with
        screeching howls and gargles. arthur cups his ears.

                          arthur
                  ahhh, what the hell is that?!

                           ford
                  here.   put this in your ear.

        ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. he
        moves to put it in arthur's ear. arthur struggles.

                          arthur
                  what?...stop!..don't come near me with...

        the loud gargling noise continues. ford has to wrestle to
        get the fish in arthur's ear.

                  argh!   what's happening...?

        as he succeeds, the noise mutates to the vogon captain's
        voice. arthur looks incredulous.

                          jeltz (on speaker)
                  this is your captain speaking, so stop

        and arthur. they struggle.

                          vogon guard
                  resistance is useless!

        the struggle continues. as they're dragged out the door,

        ford wrestles with him, trying to keep it in.
