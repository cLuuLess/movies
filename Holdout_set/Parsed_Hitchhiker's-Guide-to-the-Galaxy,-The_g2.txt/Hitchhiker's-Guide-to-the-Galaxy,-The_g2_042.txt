        vogon controllers and copilots turn dials and push
        buttons, scrambling to regain a signal.

                     such generators were often used to break
                     the ice at parties by making all the
                     molecules in the hostess's undergarments
                     leap simultaneously one foot to the left,
                     in accordance with the theory of
                     indeterminacy.

        kwaltz and questular appear on the monitor.

                             kwaltz
                     well, captain...?

        controllers turn more dials, trying to find the ship.

                     many respectable physicists said they
                     weren't going to stand for that sort of
                     thing partly because it was a debasement
                     of science, but mostly because they didn't
                     get invited to those sort of parties.

                             vogon captain
                     we had them sir. these are the
                     coordinates. but -- they're not here.

                             kwaltz
                     i can see that.     where are they?

        the captain shrugs.    kwaltz heaves a walrusy sigh.
