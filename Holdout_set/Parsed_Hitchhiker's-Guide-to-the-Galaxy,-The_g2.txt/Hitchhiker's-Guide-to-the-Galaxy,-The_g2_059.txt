71      int. vogon administration building - day                     71

        the dullest office environment ever. a counter with few
        vogons behind it, mindlessly moving bits of paper around.

         the front doors burst open. arthur storms through them,
         holding marvin's arm which has the fingers pointed like a
         gun. he trips, falls, drops the arm, picks it up again,
         trying hard to look tough. ford and zaphod follow, zaphod
         wearing the thinking cap and sunglasses for disguise.
         ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit.

         the vogons look up, nonplussed.

                              arthur
                      alright, where is she?

                      who? the director of robot arm repair?
                      next building, out the door to the left.

         arthur looks at the arm -- then slowly lowers it.

                              arthur
                      actually, we're looking for...
                           (how to put this...?)
                      ...someone you're detaining, perhaps in
                      some form of incarceration...
