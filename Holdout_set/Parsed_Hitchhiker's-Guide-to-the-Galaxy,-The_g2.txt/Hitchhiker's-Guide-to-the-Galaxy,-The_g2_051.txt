62      ext. viltvodle 6. main street - night                       62

        zaphod, held aloft on ford and arthur's shoulders,
        staggers down the street toward the spaceport where the
        heart of gold is parked. his neck is wrapped with a
        blood-soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot.

                           arthur
                   are we sure this is the right way?

                            ford
                   yes!   i think.   i don't know.   maybe not.

                           arthur
                   yes, thank you for clearing that up.

        ford looks puzzled at arthur. did i clear it up? a crowd
        has gathered. when they see zaphod, they scream...

                           crowd
                   mr. president!...zaphod, over here!...i
                   want to have your baby!, etc...

        zaphod, still feeling the effects of whatever drugs he
        was given, dons a presidential smile and waves.

                           ford
                   back to the ship. quickly.

        they quicken their pace when suddenly...

        fifty vogon police -- emerge from the mist.

                           vogon police #1
                   mr. president! we are here for your
                   protection!

        zaphod, ford, trillian and arthur freeze in their tracks.
