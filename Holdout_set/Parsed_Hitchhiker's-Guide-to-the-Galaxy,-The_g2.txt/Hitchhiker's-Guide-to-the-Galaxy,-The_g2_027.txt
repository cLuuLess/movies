35      int. vogon command headquarters - moments later                        35

        kwaltz sits at the end of a concrete war room table.

                             kwaltz
                     get me the vice-president.

        approximately 15 vogons sit around the table murmuring
        sporadically. a vogon messenger runs up, holding papers.
        kwaltz takes them, signs, signs the next page -- and the
        next. he hands them back to the messengers (who has been
        jogging in place the whole time). he runs off. the
        vogon captain appears on the large screen before him.

                             kwaltz (cont'd)
                     hyperspace permission granted, captain.
