102       ext. earth ii. english countryside - continuous                102

          a & s swoop down and soar over the english countryside --
          partially constructed; tall tree stocks with branch and
          leaves lying beside them, waiting to be attached. men
          rolling out sod like a giant carpet, etc.

                      i don't know, perhaps i'm old and tired,
                      but i always think that the chances of
                      finding out what's really going on are so
                      absurdly remote that the only thing to do
                      is say hang the sense of it and keep
                      yourself busy. i'd much rather be happy
                      than right any day.

                              arthur
                      and are you?

                              slartibartfast
                      no. that's where it all falls down of
                      course.
                         (slowing the platform)
                      here we are, then.

l03      the platform slows to a stop.      arthur steps out and is     103
         stunned to see...

         his house. it's partially constructed. the chimney lies
         intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. a row of
         hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. but it's his
         house alright.

                              arthur
                      is this...?

         slartibartfast nods.      arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward
         the house.

103a     int. arthur dent's house/mark 2 - continuous                   103a

         arthur enters his house. there is no furniture, no
         photographs or books or any evidence of his existence
         there. he feels the walls, the countertops. he's home?

                                trillian (o.s.)
                      arthur!

         arthur pokes his head around a wall to find...

104      ford, zaphod and trillian -- sitting at an elegantly set       104
         table -- stuffing their faces with a meal fit for a king.

103a     int. arthur dent's house/mark 2 -                              103a

                              arthur
                      what -- what are you doing? what happened
                      to you?

         they talk while continuing to stuff food in their mouths.

                              ford
                      funniest thing. (chew, chew) our hosts
                      attacked us with dismodulating anti phase
                      stun mist (chew, chew) then brought us to
                      this amazing meal as a way to make it up
                      to us (chew, chew). try the mutton. it's
                      fantastic.

                         (mouth full)
                       zarking incredible.

          they can't seem to stop eating, like they've been
          drugged.

                               arthur
                       hosts attack you --? and then you sit
                       down for -- is that tea?

          arthur has spotted a tea pot on the table. he hurries to
          it, feels it. warm. he pours a cup, takes a sip,
          closes his eyes, enjoying it.

                               arthur (cont'd)
                       now that's a cup of tea.

                               franky mouse (o.s.)
                       we're glad you like it, earth creature.

          he looks down and sees the two white mice sitting on a
          silver platter.

                               benjy mouse
                       after ten million years on earth, and a
                       rather large chunk of that time in
                       england, it would be utterly humiliating
                       if we didn't know how to make a decent pot
                       of tea.

          arthur stares in shock...can't speak.

                               trillian
                       arthur, these are our hosts. benjy mouse
                       and franky mouse (chew, chew).
                       they control a large sector of the
                       universe in our dimension (chew, chew).
                       i'm sorry, i thought you were told about
                       the mice...

                                arthur
                       yes. yes, i was. i just wasn't quite
                       prepared for the full reality of it.

          he steadies himself on the table.

                               benjy mouse
                       sit, earthman. eat.

          benjy pushes his hand through the air, the chair at the
          end slides backward.

                               arthur
                       in a moment, perhaps.   i can't seem to let
                       go of this table.

          slartibartfast steps forward.

                    pardon the interruption, but i'll just be
                    getting back to work now.

                            benjy mouse
                    that won't be necessary, slartibartfast.

                            zaphod
                       (cracking up, like he's stoned)

                    right.

                            benjy mouse
                    it looks like we won't be needing the new
                    earth after all, now that we've found the
                    only living native of the planet.

                            slartibartfast
                    but...they've nearly finished the oceans.

                            frahky mouse
                    that will be all, slartibartfast.

          slarti, slightly hurt, backs away out of sight.

                            arthur
                    i'm sorry, when you say "the only living
                    native" -- do you mean me? what about
                    her?

          benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as trillian's.

                            benjy mouse
                    we performed some rudimentary dna tests on
                    the ship. she's half-native. her real
                    father was a blahardid, the hyper-
                    intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race
                    native to the planet olbed, who apparently
                    popped in to earth for a one-nighter with
                    a one ms. francis mcmillan.

                            trillian
                       (looking up, mouth full)
                    which explains a lot.

          she goes back to eating.    arthur is taking this all in.

                            arthur
                    so -- mostly harmless and me.    that's it.

                            benjy mouse
                    we're sorry to have stage managed you so
                    shamelessly, but once we learned you were
                    the only full-blooded earthling in the
                    universe, it was important that we get you
                    here by any means necessary.

                    we've spent a considerable amount of time
                    on your planet trying to find this
                    wretched ultimate question, and the
                    thought of doing it all over again on
                    account of those idiotic vogons sickens me
                    to no end. which is why you're here.

                            benjy mouse
                    sit, earthling. sit.

          arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him.

                            benjy/franky
                    not there!

          arthur jumps. the others look up.      benjy and franky
          cover their outburst with a smile.

                            benjy mouse
                    this chair is much more -- comfortable.

          benjy makes a motion. the chair he pushed out before
          slides over behind arthur's knees, making him sit.

                              benjy mouse (cont'd)
                    drink.

          he slides the cup of tea over.     arthur takes a sip.

                              arthur
                    mmmm.    this really is delicious.

                            benjy mouse
                    good. glad you like it.      now -- to

          ford and zaphod raise their glasses like drunken sailors.

                              zaphod
                    sorry.    thought you were proposing a

          one notices, through the window, a row of vogons cresting
          the hill.

                            benjy mouse
                    about this ultimate question. you see,
                    we've been offered a quite enormously fat
                    contract to do the 5d tv chat show and

                            franky mouse
                    but - and here's the point - we have to
                    have product. which means we still need
                    an ultimate question.

                            benjy mouse
                    or at least, one that sounds ultimate.

                               franky house
                    yes.     got to sound good.

                            arthur
                    an ultimate question that sounds good...
                    from a couple of mice...for a chat show.

                            franky mouse
                    and as it turns out, the chances are
                    astronomically high that the structure of
                    the question is encoded in your brain.
                    which is why we need it. more tea?

          franky tries to pour more tea. arthur stops drinking, a
          little woozy. did he hear them right?

                            arthur
                    i'm sorry -- did you just say you need my
                    brain?

                               benjy mouse
                    yes.     to extract the question.

                            arthur
                    you can't have my brain. i'm using it.

                               franky mouse
                    barely.

                             benjy mouse
                     we can replace it if you think it's
                     important. an electronic brain maybe.

                             franky mouse
                     a simple one should suffice. who would
                     know the difference?

                             arthur
                     i would!

                     to.

          and wrap around his arms. a dome flips over from the

          they're gorging on the food, half-lidded, out of it.

                            arthur (cont'd)
                    what are they-- what's in the food?!
                    what was in that tea!?

          the platter the mice are standing on rises up, moves toward
          arthur, ominous surgical instruments spring from it.

                            benjy mouse
                    don't worry. you won't feel a thing.

          the mice on the platter move ominously toward arthur.
          arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away.

          scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot
          out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.

                             arthur
                    wait a minute, just wait a sodding
                    minute!!

          the scythes and arms stop spinning. arthur stumbles
          backwards and sits down in the chair. the others stop
          eating and listen.

                            arthur (cont'd)
                    you want the question that goes with the
                    answer "42" how about "what's six times
                    seven?" or "how many vogons does it take
                    to screw in a lightbulb?" or here's one,
                    "how many roads must a man walk down?"

                            benjy mouse
                    hey, that's not bad.

          through the opposite window (in much the same way
          bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more vogons
          arriving.

                            arthur
                    fine. take it. there's plenty more where
                    that came from because my head is filled,
                    with questions, and i can assure you mate,
                    no answer to any of them has ever brought
                    me one iota of happiness. confusion? yes.
                    indecision? loads. but happiness...?

          he shakes his head.

                            benjy mouse
                    we don't want to be happy.   we want to be
                    rich.

          benjy steers the platter toward arthur. he jerks his
          arms up. they break free of the shackles and hit the
          platter. the mice fly through the air and land on the
          table -- right beside the pov gun. they scramble to
          their feet.

                            benjy mouse
                    shoot him!!

          they try to lift the pov gun but it's way too heavy.

          arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over
          to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg
          of mutton. he raises it high. benjy and franky look up.

                            franky mouse
                    oh, shit.

          arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat.

          the others instantly snap out of their food induced haze,
          zaphod suddenly clutches his gut.

                            zaphod
                    ohhhh, i think i'm gonna be sick.

          arthur looks up and now he sees the vogons marching down
          the hill toward the house. he leans over the table,
          bumping his teacup. it shatters to the ground.

105       on the hill just beyond --                                   105

          an army of vogon police march over it.    amongst them...

          marvin -- marches as well, a gun held to his head.

                            marvin
                       (to the vogon)
                    i must warn you, i'm feeling very
                    depressed.

                            kwaltz
                    mr. president!     we are here for your
                    protection!

          zaphod appears at the front door and waves presidentially.

                            zaphod
                    thank you!

106       the police open fire. zaphod and the others flee as the      106
          barrage of fire continues. trillian drops the pov gun,
          goes back for it. arthur stops her and pulls her behind
          the truck. marvin catches a bullet in the back of his
          head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! is he dead?

          behind the truck --

          ford looks at marvin lying face down in the dirt - his
          head emitting smoke.

         more gunfire erupts. ford spins his towel until it's
         twisted and taught. he leaps up and runs towards...

107      ...the vogon police force -- who see him coming, his            107
         towel held like he's going to whip someone on the ass.

         their heads as we hear the weapons fire. they look up.

108a     all the vogon police lie motionless on the ground                108a

         he marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his
