        arthur looks around and notices the room is gleaming
        white, hi-tech, brand new, plastic still on some stuff.

                              arthur
                     now this is more like my idea of a
                     spaceship. look at all these buttons...

                             ford
                     shhh.

        they listen.    hear footsteps.

                             ford (cont'd)
                     this way.

        he pushes a button. the door slides open with a satisfied
        sigh -- "hhhmmyaaaahhh". as they walk through...

                              door
                     thank you for using this door. i've
                     enjoyed opening for you. hhmmyaahh...

        they leap through to the other side as the door closes.

                             marvin (0.s.)
                     ghastly, isn't it?

        they whip around to find marvin standing before them.

                              marvin (cont'd)
                      i've been ordered to take you up to the
                      bridge. here i am, brain the size of a
                      planet, and they ask me to take you up to
                      the bridge. call that job satisfaction? -
                      'cause i don't.

         marvin turns and walks away. they shrug to each other and
         follow. marvin passes through another door that opens with
         the same sigh -- "hhmmaaaahhh"

                               door
                      what a pleasure it is to open for you.
                      i will gladly close for you now.

         the door closes.

                               marvin
                      "all the doors in this spacecraft have a
                      cheerful and sunny disposition. it is
                      their pleasure to open for you, and their
                      satisfaction to close again with the
                      knowledge of a job well done.

         the door repeats its whole closing and opening routine
         again.

                      sorry, did i say something wrong? pardon
                      me for breathing, which i never do anyway,
                      so i don't know why i even bother to say
                      it. oh god, i'm so depressed.

         they round a corner...

                    and then i've got this terrible pain in
                    all the diodes down my left side. i've
                    asked for them to be replaced but no one
                    ever listens.

                            arthur
                    really? wonder why?

                       (aside to arthur)
                    probably because he's so negative.

                            arthur
                    yes, i know. i was being...never mind.

         they continue on.
