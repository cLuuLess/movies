5   ext. arthur dent's house - morning                          5

    arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in
    front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his
    house. he yells into his mobile phone.

                       arthur
                  (into phone)
              what do you mean he's gone out to lunch?
              you just said he was still at breakfast!

    mr. prosser, a bureaucrat, leans over him.

                      prosser
              come off it, mr. dent. you can't lie in
              front of the bulldozers forever.

                      arthur
              i'm game. we'll see who rusts first.

                      prosser
              this bypass has got to be built and it's
              going to be built. you should have made
              your protest months ago.

                      arthur
              the first i heard of it was when a workman
              came yesterday. i asked if he'd come to
              clean the windows, and he said he'd come
              to demolish the house. he didn't tell me
              right away of course. first he wiped a
              couple of windows and charged me twenty
              quid. then he told me.

    the bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the
    steering wheel. prosser removes plans from his briefcase.

                         prosser
                 look. these plans have been on display at
                 the planning office now for a year.

                         arthur
                 on display? i had to go down to a cellar!

                         prosser
                 that's the display department.

                         arthur
                 i eventually found them in the bottom of a
                 locked filing cabinet in a disused
                 lavatory with a sign on the door saying
                 'beware of the leopard'.

                         prosser
                 mr. dent, have you any idea how much
                 damage that bulldozer would suffer if i
                 just let it roll straight over you?

                         arthur
                 how much?

                         prosser
                 none at all.

                         ford (o.s.)
                   (american accent)
                 arthur!

    arthur and prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill,
    pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and
    bags of peanuts. this is ford prefect. wiry, intense.
    as he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down
    towards arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket.
    he rolls right past arthur and the bulldozers.

                         arthur
                 ford?

    he leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.

                         ford
                 arthur! there you are. here drink and
                 eat with me. we need to talk.

                         arthur
                 er, um...now's not the best time, ford
                 they're going to demolish my home,

                          ford
                 whoa.   you already know? how?

    arthur simply motions to the bulldozer.

                       ford (cont'd)
               oh. when you say "they" you mean they.
               got it. listen, i gotta tell you
               something important, and i gotta tell you
               now.

                       arthur
               but what about my house?

    ford looks to prosser who is conferring with the
    bulldozer driver. he pushes the cart over to him.

    arthur - watches as ford gestures to prosser who waves
    his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die.
    the bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer
    and eating the peanuts. ford returns to arthur.

                      ford
              c'mon. let's go to the pub. he said they
              won't destroy your house until they've
              finished the beers.

                      arthur
              can we trust him?

                       ford
               i'd trust him to the end of the earth.

                      arthur
              and how far's that?

                      ford
              about twelve minutes away.
