92      ext. rock formation - day                                     92

        arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring
        across the field at the beautiful double sunset. he looks
        over and sees the two mice from the ship -- scurrying
        toward one of the giant stone doors. they slip through a
        crack beneath the stone. a flash of light bursts through
        the crack. arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion.

                          arthur
                  life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?

                          marvin
                  don't talk to me about life.

                          arthur
                  here i am, god knows how far from home...

                          marvin
                  don't talk to me about god.

                          arthur
                  ...and this is where i see the most
                  spectacular sunset i've ever laid eyes on.
                  we only had the one sun at home. planet
                  called earth.

                             marvin
                     i know. you keep going on about it.      it
                     sounds awful.

                             arthur
                     oh no, it's beautiful.    or at least, it
                     was...

                             marvin
                     did it have oceans?

                              arthur
                     yes.   great wide rolling blue oceans.

                             marvin
                     can't bear oceans.

        arthur looks up at marvin.

                             arthur
                     so this is how it will all end, then? me,
                     on a dead planet -- with a manically
                     depressed robot.

                             marvin
                     you think you've got problems? what are
                     you supposed to do if you are a manically
                     depressed robot? no, don't bother to
                     answer that, i'm fifty thousand times more
                     intelligent than you and even i don't know
                     the answer. it gives me a headache just
                     trying to think down to your level.

                             slartibartfast    (0.s.)
                     excuse me.

        arthur spins to see an old, bearded man in long robes.

                             arthur
                     aah!

        he jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man.

                             arthur (cont'd)
                     who are you?

                             slartibartfast
                     my name is not important.

        arthur continues to scramble away from the man.

                             slartibartfast (cont'd)
                     you must come with me. terrible events are
                     afoot. you must come or you'll be late.

                             arthur
                     late? what for?

                             slartibartfast
                     what is your name, earthman?

                    late   as in "the late dentarthurdent."
                    it's   a sort of threat you see. never been
                    much   good at them myself, but i'm told
                    they   can be terribly effective.

        he motions to the stone that is marked "to showroom."

                            slartibartfast (cont'd)
                    your friends are safe. you can trust me.

                            arthur
                    trust a man who won't tell me his name?

                            slartibartfast
                    my name? very well...
                       (heaves a sigh, reluctant)
                    my name is...slartibartfast.

        arthur reacts with a furrowed brow.

                            slartibartfast(cont'd)
                    i said it wasn't important.

        slartibartfast motions to the door.     he looks to marvin.

                             marvin
                    i could calculate your chances of survival
                    -- but you won't like it.

        arthur rises, cautiously moves over to slarti's side.

                            slartibartfast
                    i must warn you. we are about to pass
                    through, well, a sort of gateway thing. it
                    may disturb you. it scares the willies out
                    of me.

        he puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and
        presses. the stone dissolves revealing once again the
        jet engine swirling vortex. slarti motions -- after you.

        arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in.

                              arthur
                    whaa!

        he is bent, twisted and sucked away.     slarti follows.

        marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to...

92a     the sky--                                                       92a

        where the fleet of vogon ships has now arrived.

                            marvin
                    funny how just when you think life can't
                    possibly get any worse, it suddenly does.
