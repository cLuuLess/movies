                        (into microphone)
                     bring me the request to pursue fugitive
                     forms.

        the war room is silent. we hear the sound of running
        above. the footsteps hurry all the way around, we hear a
        door open, running up more steps, along the corridor
        until and finally an exhausted vogon messenger bursts
        through the door holding a blue form. questular shakes
        his head in disbelief as kwaltz signs the request form.

                     this is ridiculous! what do you need, an
                     executive order? fine. i order you. stop
                     doing this! go and get him!

                             kwaltz
                     according to subsection 94b, paragraph 2,
                     you're not authorized to make such an
                     order.

                             questular
                     but i'm acting president!

                             kwaltz
                     then act like a president, and do nothing.

        kwaltz continues to fill out the forms. questular grabs
        a clump of his hair -- and pulls it out.
