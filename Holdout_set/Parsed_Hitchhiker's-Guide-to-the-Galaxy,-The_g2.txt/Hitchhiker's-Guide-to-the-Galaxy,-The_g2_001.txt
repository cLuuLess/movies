    int. arthur dent's bedroom - morning                        2

    close on the clock radio from which the voice emanates.
    a hand shuts it off. arthur dent is awake. 30's. kind
    faced. his feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands
    and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room.

3   in the bathroom - arthur gargles in front of the mirror.    3
    he bends over to spit revealing a yellow bulldozer
    through the window, crawling toward his house. a tea
    kettle whistles o.s.
