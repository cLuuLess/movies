         hanging on the wall is the official presidential portrait,
         featuring zaphod who sports a very smart suit and a fake
         politicians smile. tilt down to the door which opens -
         "mmyyahhh!" - to reveal ford, arthur and marvin.

                            marvin
                    i've brought the aliens.    don't thank me
                    or anything.

         zaphod spins around in his chair, holding a gun but
         sporting that same politically correct smile.

                              zaphod
                    freeze!

         arthur and ford throw their hands up.      marvin doesn't.

                            marvin
                    do you mean sit in a corner and rust or
                    just fall apart where i'm standing?

                           zaphod
                   i wasn't talking to you.

                              ford
                    zaphod?

                              zaphod
                    ixxie?    it is you!   ixxie!

         zaphod gives ford a big bear hug. he pulls away, then
         playfully punches ford in the arm.

                            zaphod (cont'd)
                    praxibetel ix, you zarking hoopy!     what
                    the hell are you doing here?

                            ford
                    i don't know! just stuck out the thumb
                    and here i am.

                     saw you, you were a beach bum.

                             zaphod
                     is it a great galaxy or what?
                        (punching his arm again)
                     i still can't believe this. ixxie!    here!
                     on my ship!

                               zaphod
                     hmm?

                             ford
                     my name. it's ford prefect. picked it up
                     on earth. sorta grew on me.

                             zaphod
                     okay "ford" -- you zarking frood.

        they embrace, tussle, punch arms. they bump into arthur.

                              ford
                     oh, this is arthur. arthur, this is
                     zaphod beeblebrox. my cousin? semi-half
                     brother?

                             zaphod
                     he shares three of the same mothers as me.

                             arthur
                     we've met.

                             zaphod
                     have we? sorry. i've got a terrible
                     memory for species.

        before arthur can explain, trillian enters.

                             trillian
                     everything okay?

        arthur is stunned silent. he goes to her, making sure she's
        really there. he's speechless. she smiles and gives him a
        friendly embrace.

                           arthur
                      (completely bewildered)
                   i can't believe this...i've been
                   looking...and you're here? i went to get
                   wine and...

                           trillian
                   i know. and it was rude to just leave,
                   but i told you i wanted to get away, and
                   he had a spaceship parked outside, well,
                   honestly -- i assumed you were a sort of
                   stay-at-home-and-read-a book type.
                      (hopeful)
                   but you're here...

        arthur smiles, then realizes with some regret...

                           arthur
                   actually -- i am that type. but...well
                   you do know what happened, don't you?

        zaphod stops in between them, puts his arm around arthur.

                           zaphod
                   --ford picked him up, they hitched a ride,
                   and here we all are. now, enough small
                   talk, trill. we're on the run, remember?
                   i stole a ship?

                           arthur
                   we're having a bit of a chat if you don't
                   mind.

        arthur shoves zaphod's hand off his shoulder. oddly,
        zaphod reacts with a smile. and then -- his head shoots
        all the up way revealing a second head that lives
        somewhere under his chin.

                            zaphod head 2
                    you blew it with her, earthman, so shut up
                    or i'll kick you in the gones!

                            ford
                    there's the zaphod i remember.

        arthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists.

        zaphod wrestles with head 2 while a third arm springs out
        of zaphod's chest and punches arthur in the jaw. arthur
        buckles and hits the floor.

                            zaphod head 2
                    you should teach your pal a lesson, ford.
                    he's a guest on my ship.

                            ford
                    i thought you said you stole it.

         hurries to the console. ford follows.

         trillian hurries to arthur who nurses his jaw.

                       all week looking for tricia mcmillan and

         a dull gray rectangular vogon battle cruiser is easing up

         one hundred other battle ships, flying in formation.

                  we need proper authorization before
