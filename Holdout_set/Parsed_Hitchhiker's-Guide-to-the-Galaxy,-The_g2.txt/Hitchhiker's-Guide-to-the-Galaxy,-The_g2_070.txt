                      relax.

                          control. good luck!

            big swell of muzak. the ship drops like a stone.
            the missiles -- miss, then turn in a screeching curve.

                          i can't do this without my other arm!

(84 cont) the h.o.g. -- spirals wildly, missiles narrowly missing. (84 cont)

(85 cont) in the safety pod - everyone is thrown.                          (85 cont)

(84 cont) in the sky -- the missiles are dead ahead, shooting              (84 cont)

                          no.   they're right behind us.

            he looks down, sees the improbability drive button.

                                  arthur
                          look, why don't i just hit this thing?

                          no! we're here! no telling where it will
                          send us!

             the missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky. a
             second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they
             soar back toward the h.o.g. --- much, much faster.

            they all stare at the approaching missiles. arthur looks
            at the drive button. screw it. he flips open the glass
            lid.
                               zaphod
                       no!

            too late. arthur hits the button.

            woomf! light blasts through the bridge. morphing
            madness!
