94      int. magrathea/planet showroom - day                          94

        arthur is hunched over a litter bin, barfing.

                           slartibartfast
                   i told you you might find it a bit
                   disturbing.

                           arthur
                   i have found this whole day a bit
                   disturbing.

        arthur realizes he has his towel with him. he wipes his
        mouth with it, dabs his brow. then he notices...

        ...the room -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only
        instead of cars there are models of various planets.

                           slartibartfast
                   did you know we built planets?

        no.   arthur didn't know that.   he looks perplexed.

                           slartibartfast (cont'd)
                   fascinating trade. doing the coastlines
                   was always my favorite. used to have
                   endless fun doing all the little fiddly
                   bits round fjords. but the galactic
                   economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-
                   built planets are something of a luxury
                   commodity...
                        (getting back on subject)
                   at any rate, there's been a terrible mix
                   up with your planet. you must come with me
                   or it's all going to blow up in our faces.
                   the best laid plans of mice, you know...

                           arthur
                   ...and men.

                           slartibartfast
                   mmmm? what?

                           arthur
                   the best laid plans of mice and men.

                             slartibartfast
                     i don't think men have got much to do with
                     it.

        arthur looks confused.     slarti motions him to a door.

95      arthur readies his towel at his mouth as slarti hits a        95
        button. the door slides open and nothing happens. it's
        just a door that leads to a room where several transport
        carts move past -- like a kids ride at disneyland. they
        step into one. slarti closes the little door. the cart
        moves through a curtain, out into deep space.

        pull back - till the cart is no more than a speck being
        pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history.
