64          int. heart of gold. bridge - continuous                              64

            ford and arthur drag zaphod into the bridge. on the
            front screen, they can see the vogon ships flying away.

                                  arthur
                          we have to go!     let's go!

                                  zaphod
                             (still loopy)
                          right!

            looking strangely happy, he slides the pink coordinate
            cube humma gave him into a slot on the console.

                                  zaphod (cont'd)
                          computer! take us to magrathea!

                                  arthur
                          what? no! follow those ships!

                                                             (continued)

        arthur lunges for a control. zaphod woozily tries to
        stop him. there's a struggle, then zaphod realizes...

                             zaphod
                     hey -- my third arm.   i had one, didn't i?

                             arthur
                     we have to go after her!

        the computer fires to life, bleeps and blips. only now
        it has an effete, effeminate, almost matriarchal voice.

                             eddie
                     boys, please! not so rough. you're
                     damaging my joystick.

        they all look at the source of the voice, confused.

                             ford
                     who is that?

                             marvin
                     ghastly, isn't it? i was asked to change
                     the personality type, this was the
                     emergency back-up.

                             eddie
                     how, if you want me to take you somewhere,
                     we're going to have to start using our
                     magic words, "please" and "thank you."

                             arthur
                     can you change it back?

                             marvin
                     i can -- but i won't enjoy it.

                             eddie
                     i'm wait-ing...

        arthur sees the vogon ships getting away. desperate, he
        shoves_zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. zaphod hits the
        floor, considers protesting, lies down on the floor to
        sleep instead -- with a contented smile.

        arthur sits. he looks very out of place in a seat
        normally reserved for the likes of han solo. he scans
        the console. ford sits in the seat beside him.

                               arthur
                     ford?

                               ford
                     marvin?

                             marvin
                     don't look at me.   i'm too depressed.

                              arthur
                         (getting desperate)
                     computer?! isn't there some kind of
                     manual override switch thing?

                             eddie
                     yeeessss...

                            arthur
                     well where the hell is it?!

                             eddie
                     magic words?

                             arthur
                     show me the override switch or i'll
                     reprogram you with a very large axe.

                              eddie
                        (long pause)
                     i can see this relationship is something
                     we're all going to have to work at.

64a     ding. a chime sounds. a switch on the console                 64a
        illuminates. "manual override." arthur flips the switch.
        the cockpit is sealed in a glass ball and shoots upwards.
