    2   ext. deep space - night                                      52

        we hover above a greenish/purplish planet.

        improbability effect - space ripples. something begins to
        materialize, something big and gray - tumbling toward us.

        we now see the big, gray thing is a giant rhinoceros --
        which ripples, flips inside out and becomes the heart of
        gold.

53a     int. heart of gold. bridge - night                           53a

        a knitted version of arthur, trillian, ford and zaphod
        sit in chairs before the ships console.

                          knitted zaphod
                     (clutching stomach)
                  is this going to happen every time we hit
                  that button?

                          knitted trillian
                  very probably, yes.

53      the air ripples. the 'knitted' crew flip back to their       53
        former selves. arthur pukes into a trash bin and with a
        sick expression, looks up to the screen.

                          arthur
                  did it work? are we there?

        now zaphod looks -- and he's elated.

                          zaphod
                  yes!...i think.     computer?

                          eddie
                  hi, fella!

        head 2 suddenly springs up.

                          zaphod head 2
                  can you please change that zarking
                  annoying voice!!?

                          trillian
                  computer? what planet is that, please?

                          eddie
                  checking!!

        on-hold muzak plays. they all sit and listen for a few
        beats, then arthur yelps...

                          arthur
                  ow!!
                     (spinning around to zaphod)
                  did you just pluck a hair from my head?

                          zaphod head 2
                  yeah, as if, apeman.

        arthur suddenly feels something on his back, leaps out of
        the chair and brushes it off.

        the two mice land on the floor across the ship, then
        scurry away down a hallway. before arthur can react...

                             eddie
                     thanks for waiting, everyone. i'm just
                     tickled pink to tell you we are currently
                     in orbit around the planet viltvodle 6.

        push in on zaphod -- who's 2nd head suddenly shoots up.

                             zaphod head 2
                     humma kavula!
