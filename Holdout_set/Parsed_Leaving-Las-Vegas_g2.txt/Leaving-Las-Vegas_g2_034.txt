	33 int. ben's house - dawn
	
	ben wakes up on the kitchen floor. the fridge door is open 
	and its light is what lights ben. inside the fridge are one 
	green pepper and four bottles of vodka. without too much 
	effort ben feels for his wallet and sees that it is still 
	there, as are his car keys. he closes the fridge door and in 
	the green light from the window he lies still. the first 
	birds start singing. (the birdsong continues through the 
	following sequence, which does not have sync sound.)
