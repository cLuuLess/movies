	61 int. ben's room - night
	
	as ben closes the door. sera surveys the room.
	
				sera
			(amused)
		what this room needs... is 
		more booze.
	
	sera's pov
	
	there are bottles everywhere. ben has gone to a lot of troble 
	to lay them out in a pleasing way. 
	
				ben
		do you think so?
	
		she turns and looks at him, appraising him. suddenly she's 
	all business, in control, and ben likes it.
	
				sera
		mind if i use the bathroom?
	
				ben
		of course.
	
	she goes into the bathroom.
	
				ben
		want a drink? i'm having one.
	
				sera (off-screen)
		a shot of tequila, if you can 
		spare it.
	
				ben
		of course.
	
	ben smiles, happier than we've ever seen him. he gets her 
	order ready and then he takes a big swig from a bourbon 
	bottle. he sits on the edge of the bed.
	
	the bathroom door opens and sera comes in wearing a black bra 
	and panties. she's acting the hooker now, tough and sexy.
	
				sera
		for two-fifty we can do 
		pretty much what you want. 
		you've been drinking, so it 
		might be better if i got on 
		top, but the other way's fine 
		too. i have some jelly in 
		case you want to fuck my ass, 
		that's up to you. if you want 
		to come in my face, that's ok 
		too, just try to keep it out 
		of my hair, i just washed 
		it... and my eyes, it stings.
		
	she walks to the table and downs her tequila in one. then 
	comes to the bed, where ben is sitting. she kneels, unzips 
	his fly and begins sucking him. ben watches her, looks at her 
	reflection in the closet mirror, reaches for the bottle and 
	drinks some, being careful not to disturb sera. after a while 
	sera comes up.
	
				sera
		do you want to fuck now?
	
				ben
			(confused)
		maybe another drink first. 
			more tequila?
	
				sera
		ok... whatever.
	
	she takes the bottle and drinks. she goes down again. ben 
	stops her.
	
				sera
		what's the story? are you too 
		drunk to come?
	
				ben
			(sincere)
		i don't care about that. 
		there's time left. you can 
		have more money. you can 
		drink all you want. you can 
		talk or listen. just stay, 
		that's all i  want.
		
	she looks at him, confused. she sees a strange look on his 
	face. it throws her.
	
	this is a turning point. both of them are momentarily 
	exposed.
	
	ben lifts the sheet and moves to one side, indicating that 
	she should come into the bed. she's as confused as he is. she 
	gets in with him and he hands her the bottle.
