	93 int. rough english bar - early morning
	
	ben enters and makes his way to the bar. this is a dirty, 
	dark place. an ageing blonde in leather hot pants is dancing 
	by herself at the jukebox. a very drunk biker couple argue 
	noisily in a corner, slurring their words. there ins not much 
	gambling taking place at the eight slot machines. ben sits at 
	the bar and the bartender slaps down a paper napkin.
	
				ben
		a beer and a double kamikaze 
		please.
	
				bartender
		sure thing. anything to eat?
	
				ben
		not quite yet. first i have 
		to drink myself sober, 
		then... a few crackers, maybe 
		an egg and toast... 
		
	the bartender walks away to get ben's drinks, ben continues 
	anyway.
	
				ben
		... then i'll go home with the 
		groceries and we'll have 
		breakfast together, and 
		that'll make her feel better 
		about my condition... 
		
	ben is interrupted by the arrival of the biker girl. she is 
	young tough and pretty. she puts an arm around him and 
	presses against him.
		
				biker girl
		who the fuck are you talking 
		to, mr?
			(laughing)
		why are you all dressed up, 
		honey? my, don't you look 
		fine.
	
	she runs her tongue around her mouth.
	
				biker girl
		i am very bored with my date. 
		would you like to buy me a 
		drink?
	
	ben looks around and sees the biker staring at the two of 
	them.
	
				ben
			(loudly)
		do you mind if i buy her a 
		drink?
		
				biker
		fuck her. i don't care what 
		the fuck you do with her.
		
				ben
		maybe i could buy you both a 
		drink?
	
				biker
		fuck you. don't fuck with me, 
		motherfucker. fuck off. go to 
		it, she's waiting for her 
		drink.
	
	the biker walks over to the slot machine and begins dropping 
	in quarters, never taking his eyes off ben and the girl.
	
				biker girl
		see what an asshole he is.
			(big smile)
		i'll have a rum and coke.
	
				ben
		barman? a rum and coke, 
		please.
	
	the girl leans with her back to the bar, closer to ben , who  
	is facing the bar on a stool. she brings her face closer to 
	his.
	
				biker girl
		can i stay with you for a 
		while?
	
				ben
		you mean move in with me? 
		isn't this a bit sudden?
	
				biker girl
		oh, i don't have a lot of 
		stuff.
		
				ben
			(smiling)
		i don't think my wife would 
		dig it too much.
	
	she moves to his ear to whisper.
	
				biker girl
		maybe we could just go find a 
		room and fuck all day. you 
		wouldn't have to tell your 
		wife about that, would you? i 
		could suck you like this.
		
	and she begins sucking on his lobe. behind them. at the slot 
	machine the biker is still watching. his face fills with a 
	drunken rage.
	
				ben
		see, the thing is... fucking 
		you would be wonderful, but i 
		am deeply in love with 
		sera... 
		
	the biker throws down his beer can and walks towards the bar.
	
				ben
		... and it's almost impossible 
		for me to imagine being with 
		someone else... 
		
	the biker arrives at the bar and grabs ben.
	
				biker
		now listen, asshole, i'm not 
		gonna just sit around and 
		watch her suck on your ear.
		
	the biker is about to hit ben then holds back. he leans in 
	and puts his face next to ben's.
	
				biker
		now, i know that she came 
		over to you, like she does, 
			so i'm gonna pretend that 
		you're innocent and give you 
		one chance to walk out of 
		this place... right now.
		
				biker girl
			(to biker)
		get lost, jerk.
	
	the biker slaps her and then grabs ben by the collar.
	
				biker
		what do you say?
	
	ben shakes his arm free from the biker's grip. he thinks 
	about it for a couple of beats and then decides.
	
				ben
		i'm sorry... but she and i 
		have decided to spend a few 
		hours together in a mo -
		
	the biker headbutts ben in the face, sending him crashing off 
	his stool to the floor. his head cracks against the tiled 
	floor. the biker walks over to him, picks him up by his shirt 
	front and punches him in the nose. blood sprays on to his 
	face. the biker walks out of the bar. the girl follows him 
	quickly. the bartender takes a wet towel and walks over to 
	where ben is struggling to get up, holding his face. 
	
				bartender
		you're quite a fighter.
	
	he gives him the towel.
	
				bartender
		this may sound silly, but i'm 
		going to have to ask you to 
		leave. it's what we do around 
		here  when there's a fight. 
		men's room is around the 
		back.
