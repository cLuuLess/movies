	16 int. ben's house - afternoon
	
	ben is naked and the shower can be heard in the background. 
	the house is austere, only the minimum of furnishing. he 
	pours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp, then tops up 
	the glass. he turns on the stereo, selects a record - miles 
	davis, kind of blue - and puts it on the turntable. he turns 
	on the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank tape. he 
	puts the machine into the record mode. he kneels down next to 
	the deck and with complete precision puts the needle on the 
	second track without any problem. the music starts and 
	continues through the next sequence.
