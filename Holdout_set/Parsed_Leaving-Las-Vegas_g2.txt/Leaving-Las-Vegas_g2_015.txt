	15 ext. ben's house in sant monica - day
	
	ben walks up to his house still carrying the paper bag. a 
	young boy of about thirteen years of age is fixing a beat-up 
	bike. ben greets him.
	
				ben
		hey, brad... how's it going?
	
				brad
		hey ben. there were a couple 
		of guys looking for you.
	
				ben
		what did they look like?
	
				brad
		suits. i didn't tell them 
		anything. you know anything 
		about gears?
	
	ben takes a look. the gear mechanism is all bent out of 
	shape. he bends down to have a look. it is clear from the way 
	he deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his 
	hands. he doesn't try to force anything but he moves the 
	chain and gear mechanism to get to the problem.
	
				ben
		how'd this happen? 
	
				brad
		i was going real fast down on 
		the beach and something 
		slipped and everything got 
		jammed up.
	
				ben
		the news is not good, kid. 
		this bit here... see 
		there... it's broken. you need 
		a new  one.
	
				brad
			(upset)
			how much, do you think?
	
				ben
		i don't know. i'll find out 
		though.
	
	ben gets up, picks up his bottles and heads for his house. he 
	looks back and brad is sitting still by the bike, looking 
	totally dejected. this really seems to upset ben.
