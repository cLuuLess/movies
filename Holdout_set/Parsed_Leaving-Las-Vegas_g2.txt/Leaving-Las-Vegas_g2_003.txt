	3 int. lobby of expensive hotel - night
	
	a mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense 
	of activity and superficial excitement. music wafts 
	across the soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense 
	texture of thousands of slot machines, creating an 
	insane new age symphony.
	
	credit sequence ends.
		
	into the lobby from the street comes sera.
	
	it's hard to tell how old sera is - somewhere between 
	twenty-five and thirty-five. she is a beautiful american 
	girl. her face has the freshness of a model in a sears 
	catalogue. she is dressed simply in a short black skirt 
	and matching jacket. high heels complete the picture. 
	heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's 
	clear they find her very sexy. she acknowledges their 
	glance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator. 
	she could be a secretary, or a pa to one of the many 
	execs here in las vegas at a convention. the body language 
	is a bit different, though.
