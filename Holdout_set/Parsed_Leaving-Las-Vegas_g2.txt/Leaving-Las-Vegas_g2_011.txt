	11 int. smart business space - morning
	
	ben sitting at a desk with a phone wedged on his ear, a cup 
	of black coffee on the desk. the walls are covered with 
		framed film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed 
	with scripts. he nods from time to time and sometimes says 
	'yes' or 'ok', but it becomes clear that there is no one on 
	the other end. he drinks from the coffee cup. a woman comes 
	up to his desk, a business colleague. she puts a wad of 
	messages down on the desk.
	
				ben
		yeah, but what's the back end 
		like? by the time we're 
		through with p and a, the 
		above-the line is going to 
		take it to about fifteen and 
		with something like this... i 
		don't know if disney will go 
		for it... can i call you back 
		on this? ok... chow for now.
			(to the woman)
		good morning.
	
	
				woman
			(cautious)
		ben... mr. simpson was looking 
		for you. i said that you had 
		a doctor's appointment. he 
		said for you to go in as soon 
		as... are you ok?
	
				ben
			(pulling himself together)
		i'm fantastic, but i gotta go 
		out now... very important 
		meeting, could make a coupla 
		million for the company.
	
	ben gets up and as he passes her he grabs her and dances a 
	few steps. it is clear that she likes ben, but when his face 
	gets close to hers she smells the alcohol on his breath and 
	she turns away. ben stops dancing and smiles sadly.
	
				woman
			(tender)
		ben?
	
				ben
		what?
	
				woman
		you should go now.
	
	she leaves the room and ben goes through some routine at the 
	desk. he opens a drawer of a filing cabinet and puts in his 
	whole arm, looking for something at the very back. he pulls 
	out a small vodka bottle and opens it and then pours the 
		contents into his coffee cup. with cup in hand he leaves the 
	room.
