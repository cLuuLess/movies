	31 ext. sunset boulevard - later that night
	
	ben is cruising in his car, listening to 'lonely teardrops' 
	again. he's looking for a prostitute. he sees a girl, but 
	when he slows down she ducks into a doorway. 
	
	he looks in his rear-view mirror and sees a cop car coming up 
	fast. ben panics for a second. there is a bottle between his 
	legs. the cop car draws level and cruises alongside him for a 
	while, but then puts its lights and siren on and speeds off, 
	doing a u-turn.
		
	ben continues and then sees an hispanic girl and stops. he 
	winds down the window. he is by now almost incoherent.
	
				ben
		good evening.
