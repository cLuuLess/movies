		in los angeles?
	
	sera says nothing.
	
				yuri
		because you are sly. mmm? you 
		knew all along that there was 
		more money in las vegas. 
		didn't you?
	
	sera nervously plays with her food.
	
				yuri

		me. you know why? because we 
		belong together, sera. don't 
		we?
	
	sera forces a smile.
