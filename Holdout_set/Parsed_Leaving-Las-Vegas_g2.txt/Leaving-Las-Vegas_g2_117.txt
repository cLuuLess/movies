	ben and sera sitting opposite each other. he has a bowl of 
	rice, which he is pretending to eat in between sips of vodka. 
	she has a bowl of vegetables and rice. she sits, silently for 
	a while, and then puts down her chopsticks.
	
				sera
		you're pretty sick.
	
	ben looks away.
	
				sera
		what are you going to do?
	
	she folds her arms.
	
				sera
		i want you to go see a 
		doctor.
	
	he thinks for a while and then turns to meet her gaze. they 
	look right into each other's eyes.
	
				ben
		sera... i'm not going to see a 
		doctor.
	
	sera continues to look at him almost defiantly.
	
				ben
		maybe it's time i moved to a 
		hotel.
	
				sera

		room?
			(becoming angry)
		we're not going to talk about 
		that. fuck you! i will not 
		talk about that. you're 
		staying here. you are not 
		moving to a hotel.
		
				ben
		will you lighten up, please?
	
				sera
			(close to tears)
			one thing... one thing... this 
		is one thing you can do for 
		me. i've given you gallons of 
		free will here! you can do 
		this for me.
		
	she leans right forward.
	
				sera
		let's face it. sick as you 
		are, i'm probably the only 
		thing that's keeping you 
		alive.
	
	she stands up
	
				sera
		i have to go to work now.
	
	ben doesn't say anything. he just stares a hole in his bowl 
	of rice.
