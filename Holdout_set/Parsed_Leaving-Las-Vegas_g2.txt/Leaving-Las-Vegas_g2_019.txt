	showered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit, ben looks 
	handsome and normal. he selects another record and again sets 
	up the cassette machine to record. he turns the stereo up 
	full and dances by himself while watching mtv silent. he 
	tries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses hi balance. 
	in slow motion we see him fall. ben lies still on the floor. 
	he smiles to himself and decides top stay there for a 
	while...
