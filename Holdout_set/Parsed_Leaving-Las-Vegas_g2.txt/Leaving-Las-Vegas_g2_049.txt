	48 ext. ben's house - dawn
	
	fifteen neatly tied garbage bags and ben's furniture are 
	stacked up on the sidewalk. ben comes out of his front door 
	carrying a racing bike. he walks to the neighbors' house and 
	places the bike on the porch. we see a label saying 'to brad 
	from ben'. he walks to his black car with a small suitcase, 
	gets in and drives off.
