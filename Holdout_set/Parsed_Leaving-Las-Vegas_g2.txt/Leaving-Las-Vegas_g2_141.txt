	140 int. casino - night
	
	sera comes in and the camera follows her as she makes her way 
	to the bar. she has covered up much of the bruising with 
	make-up but it is still pretty obvious. in wide shot we see 
	her strike up a conversation with the man next to her at the 
	bar.
	
	close shot - the bar
	
	a hand comes in to shot and grips her arm firmly. we see that 
	it is a casino security guard.
	
				sera
		let go. what's the problem.
	
				security guard
		we don't want you in here, 
		that's the problem. let's go.
	
	and he jerks her arm. people are watching now.
	
				sera
		don't worry... if you don't 
		want me in here, then i don't 
		want to be in here. just let 
		go of my arm and i'll walk 
		out of here.
	
				security guard
		yeah... we'll both walk out 
		now.
	
	he steers her firmly across the floor.
