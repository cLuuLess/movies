	72 ext. the strip - night
	
	long-lens shot of ben, very drunk on the street. he falls and 
	lies still for quite a long time before getting up. he falls 
	into the road and tries to hail a cab, but none stops. a cop 
	car cruises to a halt and ben more or less imitates a normal 
	person as he walks out of shot.
