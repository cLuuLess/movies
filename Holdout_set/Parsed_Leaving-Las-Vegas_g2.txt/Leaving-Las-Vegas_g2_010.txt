	10 int. ben's bar. la - morning
	
	the bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is 
	a very bright sunny day outside. the bartender reads the los 
	angeles times. the bar surface is red vinyl. there are five 
	customers, all single men. one of them is ben and he is 
	sitting at the bar watching tv. a game show is in progress 
	and the tv sound is loud. ben finishes his drink and grimaces 
	before indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat. 
	barman pours him a whiskey - cranberry - and the camera moves 
	in closer to ben, ending in a close-up. ben takes a big hit 
	from the drink and concentrates on the tv. we hear from the 
	tv sound that it is a word game with a big prize. ben smiles 
	to himself.
	
	ben's pov of tv
	
	the talk show hostess, an american tv beauty, is showing the 
	audience the prizes available in today's game show.
	
	angle on ben
	
	as he finishes that drink and asks for another. the camera 
	moves in close on his eyes. 
	
	ben's pov of tv
	
	she turns from the prizes and looks straight into the tv 
	camera, which starts zooming into her. at first, what she is 
	saying makes complete sense, but then things change...
	
				hostess
			(smoky, sexy voice)
		just look at this studio, 	
		ben, filled with glamorous 	
		merchandise, including an 	
		extra special prize chosen 	
		just for you! a big, bad, bmw 
		motorcycle, complete with 	
		saddle bags stuffed with 	
		thousands of us dollars.
	
	"there are oohs" from the audience.
	
	
				hostess
		so, ben,
			(tosses her hair)
		let's find a bar, get drunk 	
		and go for a ride.
	
	the studio lights dim.
	
				hostess
		then we can get a suite 	
		somewhere and order up a case 
		of champagne while we fuck 	
		ourselves silly.

				hostess
		this is it, just for you,
		ben. 
	
	she unbuttons her top, licks her fingers and makes her 
	nipples hard.
	
				hostess
		because you've been so 
		patient, and because i want 
		to fuck you, take care of 
		you, and because there's 
		nothing else in the world 
		worth doing.
	
	section of the audience clapping - some women dabbing their 
	eyes.
	
				hostess
		tell you what, ben, let's go 
		to las vegas. the bars stay 
		open twenty four hours night 
		and day. just you, just me, 
		ben, think about it, all 
		right? 
	
	angle on ben
	
	lost in his fantasy
	
				ben
		i'll think about it.
	
	he looks back at the screen, but the show has returned to 
	what is known as "normal". he finishes his drink and then an 
	attack of nausea hit him. he takes a deep breath and rolls 
	his neck and his head. the barman puts down a fresh drink. 
	ben looks at his own hands...which are steady.
	
				barman
		you should go on that show.
