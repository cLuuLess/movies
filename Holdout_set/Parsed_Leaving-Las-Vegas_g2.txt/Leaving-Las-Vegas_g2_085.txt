	84 int. ben's room at the motel - day
	
	ben is packing his liquor into his suitcase. the almost-empty 
	bottles he pours into a large cup, which he drinks from. the 
	suitcase is now full and ben suddenly realizes that he hasn't 
	packed any clothes. they are all in a pile on the bed. he 
	talks to himself.
	
				ben
		maybe this isn't a good idea 
		after all.
		
	he tries to put clothes in with the bottles, but the lid 
	won't close. he sits on the bed and has an imaginary 
	conversation with sera.
	
				ben
		listen, angel... the thing is 
		that i'm nuts about you and 
		this is a bad thing... because 
		my real plan is to die here 
		and you were never even part 
		of my plan... but like i said, 
		i'm nuts about you... wait a 
		minute, i have an idea, 
		angel.
		
	and he opens the closet and finds some plastic laundry bags, 
	which he puts his clothes in.
