	28 int. strip club - night
	
	ben comes into the club and sits down next to the stage, 
	where a dancer is doing her thing accompanied by a live blue 
	trio. a swimsuited waitress comes to the table.
	
	waitress

	when you came in. anyway, they're supposed to tell you.

	back.
	
				ben

		for you to eighty-six me?
	
	angle on the stage
	
	a tough black girl dances in a world of her own, impervious 
	to the men who stare at her. the trio grinds out a dirty 
	blues. a man opposite ben places a dollar bill on the stage 
	and as the dancer squats down to pick it up he stares between 
	her legs an winks. the waitress puts down a styrofoam cup and 
	a bottle of water in front of ben but refuses to look at him.
	
				waitress
			(hostile)
		three-fifty.
	
	ben puts down a hundred on to her tray.
	
				ben
			(polite)
		could i have fives please? 
		keep one for yourself.
	
	this throws the waitress for a loop.
