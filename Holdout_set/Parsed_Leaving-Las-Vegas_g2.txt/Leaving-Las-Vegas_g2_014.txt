	14 ext. santa monica street Â— day
	
	ben carries a brown paper bag which clinks. camera follows 
	him as he walks down the street. he looks at... 
	
	ben's pov
	
	a girl walking ahead of him in the same direction. she is 
	walking her dog. she is attractive from behind. we hear ben's 
	thoughts.
	
	
				ben
			(voice-over)
		beautiful, no just the shape 
		which is nice, but the whole 
		walk, the feeling, the 
		movement. this girl is 
		pleased with herself. maybe 
		this is the only art i can 
		appreciate... i don't know if 
		this is good or bad, but 
		right now she is really 
		beautiful. when i was a boy 
		it would have been really 
		important that she have a 
		pretty face, to go with this 
		body, i mean. i still would 
		like to see her face, but her 
		beauty is no dependent on her 
		face.
	
	the dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she 
	bends down to pull at its collar. 
	
				ben
			(voice-over)
		i wonder what kind of panties 
		she's wearing. shit, that's 
		too specific, but... on the 
		other hand, you can never be 
		too specific... but then, the 
		infinitesimal must be, by 
		definition, as infinite as 
		the infinite.
	
	suddenly the girl stops. ben catches up with her and cannot 
	resist looking into her face.
	
				ben
			(voice-over)
		god, she's so young.
		
	the girl sees ben and smiles an innocent smile,
	
				girl
		hi!
	
				ben
		hi...
