	60 ext. motel parking lot - night
	
	they sit in the car for a while before speaking.
	
				sera
		i'm sort of curious... if 
		you're willing to pay me two-
		fifty... not that i mind... i 
		mean, i'm ok with that - why 
		aren't you staying in a 
		hotel?
		
				ben
		we can go to one if you'd 
		prefer.
	
				sera
		no, this is fine.  i was just 
		wondering.
	
	ben switches off the engine but makes no move to get out of 
	the car.
	
				ben
		well... i'm here because i'm a 
		drunk who tends to pass out 
		at odd hours for 
		unpredictable stretches. i'm 
		going to a hotel soon. a room 
		with a balcony to pass out 
		on... or off.
		
		he falls silent.
	
				sera
		umm. we can stay in the car 
		for an hour if you want. but 
		i really have to go then. 
		it's your time. 
		
				ben
		right, i'll get your door. i 
		tend to fade in and out 
		lately.
		
				sera
		i guess i do too.
	
				ben
		you what?
	
				sera
		i sometimes fade out.
	
				ben
		oh... well, maybe we better 
		synchronize our spells... or 
		stagger them.
		
				sera
			(gently)
		you were going to get my 
		door.
		
	he gets out and she waits for him to open the door. she gets 
	out and he offers her his arm. she takes it and they walk 
	into the motel.
