	91 int. sera's bedroom - night
	
	sera wakes and ben comes in and gets into bed with her.
	
				sera
		how are you doing?
	
				ben
		very well... umm... i never 
		expected to have to ask you 
		this again... but how did our 
		evening go? i remember 
		getting to the casino... i 
		remember kissing you... that 
		was really nice but 
		everything after that is a 
		blank.
		
				sera
		well - i was prepared for 
		worse, but it wasn't so bad. 
		we were sitting at the bar, 
		talking about blackjack. you 
		seemed just fine, a little 
		drunker than usual, but 
		nothing really strange, but 
		then your head started to 
		droop and i put my arm on 
		your shoulder and then, wham, 
		you swung you arm at me, and 
		fell backwards off your stool 
		into a cocktail waitress. you 
		smashed everything on her 
		tray, it was a real mess. you 
		kept yelling and yelling.
		
				ben
		oh, and what did you do?
		
				sera
		i tried to shut you up and 
		help you to your feet but you 
		kept swinging at me - not 
		like you wanted to hit me, 
		but more just waving me away. 
		security came and when you 
		saw them you stopped yelling. 
		they wanted to carry you out 
		and dump you on the street, 
		but i talked them into 
		letting me walk you out.
		
				ben
		that's impressive. how did 
		you do that?
	
				sera
		i told them you were an 
		alcoholic and t would take 
		you home. i also promised 
		that we would never come in 
		there again.
		
				ben
		we?
	
				sera
		yes, we.
	
				ben
			(holds her hand)
		what happened then?
	
				sera
		you were ok for a while, so 
		we walked for about a block 
		and then you said you wanted 
		to go home and fuck, but i 
		think even you knew that 
		wasn't going to happen. we 
		got a cab and you asked him 
		to stop at a liquor store, 
		even though i told you that 
		we had plenty at home. in the 
		store you gave the kid a 
		hundred and told him to keep 
		the change. i asked you if 
		you knew it was a hundred. 
		you said you did, so i let 
		you do it. we got here, you 
		fell asleep on the couch and 
		i covered you up and came to 
		bed.
			
				ben
		i warned you... 
			(kisses her hand)
		... but i'm sorry.
	
				sera
		here's my speech... 
			(kisses his hand)
		... i know this shouldn't be 
		acceptable to m, but it is. 
		don't ask me why. i sense 
		that your trouble is very 
		big... and i'm scared for 
		you... and so i'm doing what i 
		think you need me to do. 
		falling down in casinos is 
		little stuff. it doesn't 
		bother me. it has nothing to 
		do with us.
		
				ben
		that's amazing. what are you? 
		some sort of angel visiting 
		me from one of my drunk 
		fantasies? how can you be so 
		good?
		
	she turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl.
	
				sera
		i don't know what you're 
		saying. i'm just using you. i 
		need you. can we not talk 
		about it any more, please. 
		not another word.
		
	he thinks about this. he gently pushes her until she is lying 
	on her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes 
	her naked back. he kisses her in the small of her back.
	
				ben
		why don't you go back to 
		sleep. i'll go out and buy us 
		some breakfast.
		
				sera
		be careful.
	
	he stands and goes to the door.
	
				ben
		don't worry.
	
	as he leaves the room, she calls after him.
		
				sera
		ben, i'm  working tonight.
	
	he opens the door and smiles at her.
	
				ben
		i know.
	
	cut to:
