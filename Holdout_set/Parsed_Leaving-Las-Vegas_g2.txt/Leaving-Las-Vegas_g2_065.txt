	64 int. ben's room - night
	
	they are both in bed, drinking. 
	
				sera
		so, ben, what brings you to 
		las vegas? business 
		convention?
		
	they both laugh and ben hands her the bottle.
	
				ben
		no, i came here to 
		drink... myself... you know... 
	
				sera
		to death?
	
				ben
		yes, that's right.
	
	he looks at her, she at him, not sure whether to believe him 
	or not.
	
				ben
		i cashed in all of my money, 
		paid my amex card, gonna sell 
		the car tomorrow.
		
				sera
		how long's it gonna take, for 
		you to drink yourself to 
		death?
		
				ben
		i think about four weeks, and 
		i've got enough for about two 
		hundred and fifty to three 
		hundred dollars a day.
	
				sera
		yes... that should do it. what 
		am i? a luxury?
		
				ben
		yeah. and your meter just ran 
		out.
	
	ben looks at his watch.
	
				sera
		it's ok... nice watch. go on. 
		talk some more.
		
	ben yawns, suddenly deeply tired.
	
				ben
		in la i kept running out of 
		booze and the store would be 
		closed because i'd forget to 
		look at my watch... so i 
		decided to move here because 
		nothing ever closes and 
		because i got tired of 
		getting funny looks when i 
		would walk into a bar at six 
		o'clock... even the bartenders 
		started preaching.
			(yawns again)
		here, everyone's from out of 
		town so no one cares, no one 
		is overtly fucking up
		
	cut to:
	
	later.
	
	side angle
	
	sera is in focus, ben is asleep.
	
				sera (voice-over)
		i guess i was intrigued by 
		him... there was a lot of 
		stuff that i wanted to ask 
		him about but didn't because 
		i didn't want to sound too 
		interested in a trick. but i 
		felt as if a relationship was 
		being forged very quickly.
