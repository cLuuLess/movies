	13 int. ben's bmw Â— day
	
	ben drives though beverly hills. he pours the content of a 
	small bottle of vodka into an empty coke can, puts the empty 
	bottle under the seat and then drinks from the can.
	
	he slips a tape into the player and we hear "lonely 
	teardrops", by michael mcdonald, one of ben's favorite songs. 
	at a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and 
	ben takes a pull from the coke can and smiles, mouths the 
	word "hot". the cop nods back at him, the light changes and 
	they both pull away.
