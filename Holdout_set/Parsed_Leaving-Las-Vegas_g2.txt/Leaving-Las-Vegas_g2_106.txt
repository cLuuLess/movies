	sera is a very good swimmer and we see that ben must have 
	been quite an athlete. they look at each other under water. 
	they're under water for a long time. ben exhales. sera pushes 
	him towards the surface. 
	
	ben and sera come to the surface. ben has swallowed water and 
	has a coughing fit. sera hugs him until the fit passes. the 
	camera moves in tighter on them and music gives the moment a 
	strange chill.

		don't do that to me. don't
