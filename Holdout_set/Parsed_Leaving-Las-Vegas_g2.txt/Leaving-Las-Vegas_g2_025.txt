	24 int. sera's house - day
	
				yuri
		i'm pleased with you, 
		sera... how you have moved up 
		in the world. i showed you a 
		glamorous world when i took 
		you off the streets... 
			(shaking his head)
		and how you repay me.
	
				sera 
		where have you been staying?
	
				yuri
		with an old friend.
	
	he drops his fork.
	
				yuri
		but that is none of your 
		affair. you will call this 
		morning and book me into a 
		hotel suite where i will make 
		new contacts for us.
		
	the mood has changed and sera does her best to move out of 
	these dangerous waters.
	
				sera
		you'll need some money, then.
	
	yuri nods. sera rises goes to a kitchen drawers and finds 
	money.
	
				yuri
			(becoming angry)
		it is, after all, sera, my 
		money.
	
				sera
				(calmly)
		yes, of course. how much do 
		you need?
	
				yuri
			(shaking his head)
		all of it. i need to buy many 
		things... all of it!
	
	yuri is very angry and as sera hands him the money, he hits 
	her, hard, knocking her back into the refrigerator. his ring 
	cuts her cheek.
				yuri
			(shouting)
		don't look at me like that.
	
	and then his anger goes and he becomes quite tender with her. 
	he takes her face in his hands to look at the cut.
	
				yuri
		it's not so bad. it is 
		nothing.
			(whispers)
		i need money, sera. i need it 
		fast. you must go on the 
		street tonight. for me.
		
	he sits down with shaking hands. he suddenly seems more 
	vulnerable than she is. he goes to the window and looks out, 
	left and then right, as if he expects to see something.
	
				yuri
		i need money fast, sera. i 
		want you back on the street. 
		tonight.
		
	fade out:
	
	fade in slowly - sound first:
