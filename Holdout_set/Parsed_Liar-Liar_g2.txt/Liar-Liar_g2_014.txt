          int. fletcher's office - evening

          a sad max sits on fletcher's big sofa. his heart sinks
          further when fletcher enters. . . carrying two boxes of
          documents.

                              max
                    we're not going, are we?

                              fletcher
                    of course we are. a promise
                    i s a promise. we are gonna
                    see wrestling or my name isn't
                    fletcher t. reid.

          

                                fletcher
                          (to wrestler)

                          (the wrestler

                           does)
                    thank you.
                            (without looking

                           up)

                    maxer?
          push in on max; he isn't.

          jerry paces. audrey is on the phone, waiting.   she notices
          jerry pacing.
