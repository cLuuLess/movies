                                jerry

                    b oston. they really want me
                    there tomorrow.

                              audrey
                    . . . i can't go to boston.

                                jerry
                    how come?

                                audrey
                   max.

                             jerry
                   he'll love it there.

                              audrey
                    it's fletcher.

                                jerry
                   fletcher?

                             audrey
                   i can't move max three
                   thousand miles away from his
                   father.

          

                                jerry
                     audrey, i have never said a
                     bad word about your ex --

                                audrey
                     i know.

          

                                jerry
                    but how much responsibility
                    does fletcher take for max,
                    now? he'd never come over if
                    you didn't remind him.

                               audrey
                    i know. but if they're three
                    thousand miles apart they'll
                    never see each other.
                    fletcher will never come to
                    boston and how can i send max
                    cross-country to him?

                               .jerry
                    so because your ex-husband is
                    unreliable, we can't-'-

                               audrey
                    i know, it's not logical, it's
                    emotional. i'm sorry.
          pause.

                              jerry
                    i still want to marry you.

                              audrey
                    are you sure?
          jerry picks up the phone, pulls out a piece of paper,
          dials.

                               jerry
                          (into phone)

                      he wasn't there, but that's
                  1   the speech i would've made.
          she smiles and kisses him.             the phone rings.   audrey
          answers.
