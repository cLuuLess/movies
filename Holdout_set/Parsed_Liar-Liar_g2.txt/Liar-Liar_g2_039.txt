          fletcher speeds away. he pulls the blue pen from his
          pocket.

                               fletcher
                    gotta focus. . . gotta focus.
          he's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and
          almost hits an old man.

                              fletcher
                    the color of the pen is --
                    re d !      .
          but he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring
          to the red light he just ran, nearly colliding with a
          truck. the driver screams:

                              driver
                    what's your problem, schmuck?!

                                fletcher
                           (the truth)
                    i ' m an inconsiderate prick!

          
            fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.

                                fletcher (con "id)
                      c'mon, you can do this! the
                      color of the pen is -- red!
           this time he's referring to the flashing red light of a
           police car in his rearview mirror.

                                  fletc her
                     s hi t !!

          
           fletcher pulls over. a police officer strolls up.

                               police officer
                     do you know why i stopped you?

                                  fletcher
                     depends on how long you were
                     following me.

                                  police officer
                     why don't we take it from the
                     top.

                                fletcher
                    ·     (in agony)
                     here goes -- i didn't fasten
                     my seatbelt, i didn't glance
                     in my rearview mirror, i
                     didn't signal when i pulled
                     away from the curb, i sped, i
                     followed too closely, i ran a
                     stop sign, i almost hit :a
                    chevy camaro, i almost hit a
                    ge ezer, i sped some more, i
                    failed to yield at a
                    crosswalk, i changed lanes in
                    the intersection, i changed
                    lanes without signalling, and
                    i changed lanes in the

                    intersection-without
                    signalling while running a red
                    light and speeding.
          a long moment.

                             police officer
                   may i see your driver's
                   license?

                                 fletcher
                   no.

          

                              police officer
                    and why is that?

                              fletcher
                    it's in my other pants.

                              police officer
                    i see. and where are your ·
                    other pants?

                              fletcher
                    hanging from my boss's
                    credenza.

                              police officer
                    do you expect me to believe
                    that?

                              fletcher
                    no.

          

                              police officer
                    do you think i'm an idiot?

                              fletcher
                    yes -- but that's beside the
                    point! my license actually is
                    in my other pants, and they
                    actually were hanging from a
                    credenzaj i wouldn't lie to
                    you! i mean, i would if i
                    could, but i can't!

                              police officer
                    i see. so you ..have no reason
                    to try and hide your license
                    from me?

                              fletcher
                   i didn't say that. i have
                   other reasons. seventeen
                   reasons, to be precise.
                         (begrudgingly,
                          off the
                          officer's look)
                   unpaid parking tickets.

                         (beseechingly)
                   be gentle.
