          ext. park - day

          a beautiful park with a basball diamond. fletcher is
          seated on a bench, waiting. he's dressed in sweats, with a
          baseball glove. soon, jerry, audrey, and max pull up...

                                       m ax
                     dad! !

          fletcher picks max up.

                    transformer!!! .
          fletcher and max do the transformer routine again...

                                       fletcher
                     malfunction in vector seven.
                     i have lost control of my
                     affection reflex...
          fletcher starts kissing max on the head over and over. he
          sees audrey.

                                       fletcher
                     procreate!          procreate!

                                   audrey

                              (playfully)
                     fletcher... you're gonna lose
                     a limb--

          

                              max
                    come on, dad, let's play
                    catch!!

                              fletcher
                    sr. . .

                    ue
                          (starts to toss

                           max)
                    here you go, mom.
                          (max screams)
                    oh, you mean with a ball...
          he puts max down. max runs into position. fletcher stops
          for a second and turns to jerry, man to man.

                              fletcher
                    i take back every dirty,
                    dishonest thing i ever said
                    about you, wrote about you,
                    faxed about you, e-mailed
                    about you.

                              jerry
                    appreciated.
          fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.

                              fletcher
                    so, you up for a little
                    friendly competition?

                             jerry
                   no, you go play with your son.

                              fletcher
                   i wasn't talking about
                   basesball.
          a slow smile from jerry. fletcher winks and tosses the
          ball to max.

                              fletcher
                         (to max)
                   alright, it's time to show you
                   the old fletcher reid change up.

          
          fletcher winds up in an exagerated super fast motion, then
          instantly shifts to super slow motion. max cracks up.
          audrey laughs. jerry can't help but smile, too.
          there may be better things in life... but at this moment,
          it's hard to think of a single one. honestly.
