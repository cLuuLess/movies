          ext. suburban porch - afternoon


          
          a sad max and his mother, audrey, wait silently on the
          steps.

                              max
                    what time is it?

                               audrey
                           (checks her

                            watch)
                    i ' m sure he just got tied up
                    in court again.
          finally, fletcher's bmw pulls up. max races to him,
          delighted.

                               max

                          (calls out a

                           command)

                    transformers!! .
          fletcher instantly becomes a human version of the
          transformer toy making robotic movements and sounds. max
          knows the routine well, moves in perfect sine with dad. . ...
          until --                       .

                               fletcher
                    malfunction in vector 3 ! !
                    malfunction in vector 3!!
                          (pretends to lose
                           control of a
                           'robotic' arm)
                    look out! it's on tickle
                    mode!!
          fletcher's "mechanical arm" becomes claw-like, tickling max
          like crazy! max loves it.
          audrey watches these two kids, smiles.

                              fletcher
                         (re: audrey)

                    looking that good,

                    malfunction in vector 4!
          fletcher's other robotic arm becomes a "pincher", comes
          after audrey.

                         (playfully)
                    keep vector 4 away from me.
                    unless you want vector 4
                    chopped off.

                           protesting)

          audrey can't help but laugh.

                              fletcher/dan george
                    he must be schooled in the way
                    of the face-claw, the sleeper-
                    hold, and the purple nuxple.

          runs up to him.

                             jerry
                   max, my man!
          jerry gives max "five", then kisses audrey on the lips.

                              jerry
                    fletcher, good to see you?

                             fletcher
                   what? no kiss for me?

                        (re: luggage)
                   what do you say, max? give me
                   a hand?
          fletcher grits his teeth as jerry gives max a piggyback
          ride to get the luggage.

                                  audrey
                        jerry. his name is jerry and
                        yes, he's going.
