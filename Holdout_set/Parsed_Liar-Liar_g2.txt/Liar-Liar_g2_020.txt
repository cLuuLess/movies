          int. miranda's office - night


          

                                   a udrey
                      fletcher, where are you?
                      we're getting ready to cut the
                      cake.

                                   fletcher
                      urn, actually, something has
                      come up. a problem on a new
                      caaa--                .
          miranda bites one of fletcher's nipples.

                                   f let che r
                      a-h-h-h-!

          

                                audrey
                      what happened?

                                   fletcher
                      nothing. i just nailed my
                      Â·knee into the desk... listen,
                      i'm really sorry i can't 'make
                      it.

                                audrey
                      max is going to be so
                      disappointed.

                                   fletcher
                      i'll make it up to him, i
                      promise. i'll pick him up
                      from school tomorrow, okay?

                                 audrey
                      do you want me to put him on
                      the phone?
          miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.

                                   fletcher
                      ah, no.     i have to go.

          

                                 audrey
                    right.
          angrily, she hangs up. fletcher stares unhappily at the
          phone, before miranda throws him back onto the couch.
