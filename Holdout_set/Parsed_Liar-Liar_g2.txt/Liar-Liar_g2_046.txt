          fletcher collapses onto his couch. greta enters.

                             greta
                   are you okay?

                             fletcher
                   my son hates me.

                                greta
                   no! he loves you. i've seen
                   y ou together. you're his
                   hero.

                                fletcher
                   o h yeah? last night at his
                   birthday party, he made a
                   Â·wish. that i wouldn't be able
                   to tell a lie for one whole
                   day.

                                greta
                   kids...

                             fletcher
                   it came true.

                                greta
                   what?

                                fletcher
                   it's true. didn't it seem odd
                   to you that i kept telling the
                   truth all morning?

                             greta
                   well, yeah, but...

          

                         (incredulous)
                    you're telling me that you
                    can't lie.

                              fletcher
                    that's right!     i am incapable
                    of lying.
