                                 fletcher
                          (looking                    .

                           heavenward)
                    noooo!!!
          he spots a man walking by.

          

                                  fletcher
                      'scuse me, sir. do you have
                      any - -
          the man turns. it's the same beggar fletcher was rude to
          outside the courthouse.

                                beggar
                      change? absolutely.
          he continues walking.

                                fletcher
                      could you spare some?

                                beggar
                      unquestionably.
          the beggar continues on.

                  '               fletcher
                      alright, i get your point.
                      but this is a crisis! look,
                      i'll give you ten bucks.
          the beggar pulls out a quarter and holds it up.

                                beggar

                           (admiring

                            quarter)
                      it's so shiny and new.

                      thirty-four. that's all i
                      have.
          a moment as the beggar thinks, then:

                                  beggar
                      it's worth twice that to screw
                      you.
          he walks off, grinning.
