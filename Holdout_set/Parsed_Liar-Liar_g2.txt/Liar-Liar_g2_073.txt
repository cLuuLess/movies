          fletcher races by gate 15, 16, gets to 1 7 . . . but sees the
          plane slowly taxiing away.

                                  fl e tc h er
                    n ooo!!!
          fletcher spots a door marked "not an exit".    goes for it
          when a flight attendant interrupts.

                              flight attendant
                    can i help you?

                               fletcher
                    look out!! ! --

                          (truthful)

                    -nothing's coming!!
          the woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. and
          fletcher bolts through the exit!
