                    and your dad?

                                max

                          (hesitant)
                    my dad? he's . . . a liar.

          

                                  ms. berry
                             (taken aback)

                        mean "a liar."

                                  max
                        well... he wears a suit and
                        goes to court and talks to the
                        judge and--

                                  ms. berry

                             (relieved)

                        lawyer.
