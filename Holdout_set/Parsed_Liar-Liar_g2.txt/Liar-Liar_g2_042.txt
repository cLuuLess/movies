                    money and their children.

                              theodore

                    to marry a younger woman. to
                    escape a loveless marriage and
                    have cheap meaningless sex.
                    to cling to an illusion of
                    youth as his body gives way to
                    sore backs, flat feet, spare
                    tires, gum disease, hair loss,
                    liver spots, kidney stones,
                    clogged arteries, diabetes,
                    goiter and eventual death.
