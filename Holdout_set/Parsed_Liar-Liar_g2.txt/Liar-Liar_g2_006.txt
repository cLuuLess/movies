                                  audrey
                        relax, fletcher. it looks
                        like jerry's taking that job
                        offer in boston.
          fletcher turns sincere.

                                  fletcher
                        aud, i am so sorry...

          
          behind her back, he flails in celebration.    she glances
          back... he stops, whistles innocently.

                              jerry
                          (calling to

                           audrey)
                    ready?
          audrey and jerry say goodbye to max.    they get in his
          explorer.

                               fletcher
                          (to audrey)
                    yo u gonna be okay? because if
                    not, we could leave max with
                    your sister and i could go out
                    with you two, does that appeal
                    to you at all?
          they drive off.

                              fletcher
                    wave to the soon-to-be ex-
                    boyfriend, max.
                          (flipping max the

                           keys)
                    you drive.
