          he scurries down a flight of stairs calling after the plane
          which is moving away.
          no way he'll catch it.
          then, he sees a mechanic working on a mobile stairs unit
          (these are the steps they pull up to planes) fletcher gets
          an insane idea. . .
          the worker hears an engine start, looks up to see fletcher
          in the truck, driving off, towing the stairs.

                                  worker
                    hey!!      hey!!!!
          but fletcher's gone.
