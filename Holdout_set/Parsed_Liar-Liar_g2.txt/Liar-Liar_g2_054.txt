          int. rest room - day

          fletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak
          i n legal history. relief. then, he looks at his watch.
          it's only 4:15. '

                                fletcher
                    what did i think? that i
                    could piss for forty-five
                    minutes?!
          he hits his forehead in frustration... and gets an idea.
          he hits himself again and again, smashes his head into the
          wall, pokes himself in the eyes, yanks on his ears, finally
          knocks himself in the stall, where he continues his attack.
          a man enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.

                              man
                    what's going on in-there?

          

                                fletcher (o . s . )
                    i ' m abusing myself! do you
                    mind?!
          the man looks disgusted. he carefully leaves the room.
