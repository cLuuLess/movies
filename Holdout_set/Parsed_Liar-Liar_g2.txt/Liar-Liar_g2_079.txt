          ext. police station - night


          
          fletcher comes out limping, totally dishevelled, missing a
          shoe, and still holding the compress.

                               fletcher

                          (weakly)
                    greta? is that you?
          he looks up and is surprised to see audrey and jerry
          waiting for him just outside the door.
          max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still angry.
          he sees his dad, then quickly turns away.

                              fletcher
                         (to audrey and
                          jerry, trying to
                          seem chipper)
                   sorry i made you miss your
                   flight, not really.
                         (no response)
                   you're obviously a little
                 . upset, not that i blame you...
                   although i'll bet you'll still
                   get the bonus miles. . .

                              audrey
                    fletcher, are you crazy?
                    what were you doing?

                              fletc her
                    that's two questions. a; yes,
                    but i think the legal term is
                    temporarily insane. and b; i
                    was trying to finally have
                    that talk with you about
                    boston.
          audrey's patience are growing thin...

                              fletcher
                   okay, okay... the whole truth
                   and nothing but the truth,
                        (with difficulty,

                         sincerely)
                   i tried to stop the plane
                   because it was taking off with
                   my life... you and max.
          this comes as a surprise to audrey. not just what fletcher
          said, but the way he said it.

          

                               fletcher
                    i know you've met somebody...
                    somebody pretty great... and
                    the truth is i wish you didn't
                    but you did and... all i ' m
                    asking i s . . . please don't move
                    to boston. please don't take
                    max away.
          she's definitely moved by fletcher, but not convinced.

                               audrey
                    you can come visit anytime.
                    it's only a four hour flight.

                               fletcher
                    i don't want to visit him.
                    that's what i've been doing--
                    visiting him, dropping by,
                    stopping in. i want to be in
                    his life. i don't want to be
                    some jerk that sees him at
                    easter. i want to be his
                    father.
          fletcher turns to jerry.

                               fletcher
                   i know i have no right to ask,
                   but can i talk you out of
                   taki ng that job? i can get
                   you a better job here in l.a.
                   i've got all kinds of
                   connect ions... what do you do
                   again?

                              jerry
                    i design security systems.

                               fletcher
                    how symbolic. okay great.
                    you know pac-tec?

                             jerry
                   the biggest.

                               fletcher
                   one of their systems shorted
                   out and burned down a
                   supermarket. i got them off.
                   another proud day for justice.
                   if i ask them they'll beat
                   your boston offer in two
                   s ec on ds .    ..

          

                               audrey
                    don't put jerry in the middle.

                               jerry
                    it's okay.
                          (to fletcher)
                    boston means this
                          (snaps his

                           fingers)
                    to me. all i want is for this
                    lady and max to be happy.
                    preferably, with me. whatever
                    they want, i'll go along with.
          they both look to audrey.

                              audrey
                    all i want is for max to be
                    happy.
          audrey looks over to max seated at the bottom of the
          stairs. he's still upset.

                              audrey
                    you better know your jury.
                    you're hot exactly max's hero
                    today.

                              fletcher
                    just let me present my case.
          fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts walking,

          talking like the terminator.

                                fletcher/terminator
                    i have been sent from the
                    future to destroy you. . .
                    argghhh!
                         (no response, a

                          beat)
                    you mad at me?
          max nods. fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. then:

                               fletcher
                    you wanted me to stop lying.
                    but lying isn't the problem. ..
                    why we lie ~ that's the
                    problem. sometimes we lie to
                    make someone else feel better.
                    but sometimes we lie because
                    the truth gets in our way...
                          (touches him)
                    but being an adult means you
                    sacrifice some things for more

          
                    important things. much more
                    important things. i was so
                    stupid, max.
                          (pointing to his
                           own head)
                    malfunction in vector one.
                    all this time you've been here
                    and i could see you anytime i
                    felt like it. and i...
                    didn't. please don't go to
                    boston. max, i love you more
                    than anything else in the
                    world and you know it's true.
                    i couldn't say it if it
                    weren't true. not today.
          a moment as max studies his father, then:

                              max
                          (to audrey)
                    he's telling the truth, mom.
                    he's not allowed to lie. i
                    made a wish and anything dad
                    says has to be the truth.
                          (to fletcher) ..
                    right?
          but fletcher's looking at his watch...

                               fletcher
                    max. .. it's 9:22.

                              audrey
                    what?

                              fletcher
                    max, you made the wish at
                    9:15. i've been able to lie
                    for the last seven minutes.
          max steps away from fletcher.

                              max
                    so then, you were...

                              fletcher
                    no! it wasn't a lie. i just
                    wanted to be honest with you
                    and tell you -- there was no
                    wish to guarantee it anymore.
                    you just have to believe me.
          max looks at audrey, who is letting max decide for himself
          max looks at fletcher and tries to decide.

          

                                       max
                          (to audrey)
                     mommy... do we have to go to
                     boston?
          audrey looks at jerry, then back at max.

                                   audr ey
                     no.      we don't have to.
          fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "i'll
          never let you go."

                                       max
                          (to fletcher)
                     can we play catch tomorrow?
          fletcher smiles. . .
