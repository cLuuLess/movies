          ext. courtroom -, morning

          a shaky fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he
          is accosted by a beggar.

                              beggar
                    any change, mister?

                              .fletcher
                    absolutely.
          but he continues walking.

                              beggar
                    could you spare some?

          

                               fletcher
                    unquestionably.
          fletcher walks faster, puzzled that he has answered
          truthfully. the beggar is even more puzzled.

                                beggar
                    will you?

                                fletcher
                    no.

                                beggar
                    how come?

                                fletcher
                   because i resent your
                   p re sen ce. you fill me with an
                   unpleasant mixture of disgust
                   and guilt. further, i don't
                   believe you'll use the money
                   for food, but i believe you'll
                   use it for, at worst, drugs,
                   or, at best, whiskey, or
                 . cigarettes. also, i'm cheap.
          as fletcher heads up the stairs...

                                beggar
                   jerkoff.
