          da zed, fletcher makes his way down the hall. jane comes
          toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest. he
          tries to avoid her, but...

                             jane

          the now panicked fletcher breaks into a run, passing fred.

          he leans against the door, trying to catch his breath.

                    willpower.
          he dives for his desk and rifles through it.

                    a test. . . something small...
                    aha!
          he holds up a blue pen.

                               fletcher (cont'd)
                    red.   red. all right. focus,

          he takes a sheet of paper, his pen and writes "this pen
          i s . . . " he tries to write an "r" but can't. he strains.
          s tr ain s harder. he's out of his chair, on the desk. his
          feet kick over objects on the shelves'behind him. he
          finally forces pen to paper. he looks down where he wrote

          inadvertently:
                           "this pen is blue."

          greta enters to find--
          fletcher running around the office, shaking the blue pen in
          the air.

                    boss, what's wrong?

                    blue !!!
          almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. a moment --
          then greta tentatively offers him a red pen.

                                greta
                    red?

                    dun n called. they want to
                    know where the darvis
                    settlement offer stands.

                              greta
                    so then you're here?

                               greta
                    i ' m having a little trouble
                    following you. what do i say
                    to your mom?

                               fletcher

                          (resigned)
                    tell her i'm a thoughtless son
                    who'd rather spend ten hours
                    clogging the wheels of justice
                    than five minutes talking to
                    her-- but only if she asks.
                    you.might also add that she
                    deserves better, though i hope
                    to god you don't.

                               greta
                    thanks for clearing that up.
                    and that's it, except your ex
                    called and asked when you were
                    cowing over to see your son.

                               fletcher

                          (remembers)

                    ohh! i'm such a shit!!
          he reacts, particularly stunned by this truth.
