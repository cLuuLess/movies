          a sad max is seated on the steps. two other boys are there
          with baseball equipment.

          

                               paul
                    we're going home.

                              emmanuel
                    yeah, thanks for the great
                    game, max.
          emanuel knocks max's hat off. audrey's been watching from
          the door. she goes and sits by her son.

                              audrey
                    max, honey. your dad had a
                    very big case today. it
                    probably just--

                              max
                    i don't want to talk about it.

                              audrey
                    okay.

                              max

                         (suddenly)
                    i hate dad! i hate him!

                              audrey
                    honey, don^t say that.
          max is really upset. it's "that look" and then some. the
          look audrey never wanted to see again. she makes a
          decision.

                              audrey
                    max, there's something i-want
                    to talk to you about. . .
