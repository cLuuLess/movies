              int. courtroom .-- day


          
              fletcher reid, early 30's, stands before the judge. his
              manner is utterly genuine and convincing.

                                  fletcher
                        a dark street. . . a stormy
                        night... two desperate men
                        struggle... one man is taken
                        to the hospital, the other to
                        ja il. the prosecutor wants
                        you to believe this is an
                        open-and-shut case of a poor
                        man, brutally victimized.
              he nods at the victim - - a fragile old man in his 70's.

                                  fletcher (cont'd)
                        well, for once i agree with
                        t he prosecutor. this is an
                        open-and shut case -- but the
                        true victim is my client.
              fletcher's client is a 250 pound brute in a suit.

                                  fletcher (cont'd)
                        put yourself in his shoes for
                        a moment--walking home from
                        church, alone, in a
                        frightening part of the
                        suburbs.
              as he describes his client's movements, fletcher acts them

              out:

          

                               fletcher (cont'd)
                    you're nervous, timid, looking
                    over your shoulder -- when
                    suddenly, you encounter him--
                          (pointing at the
                           old man)
                    pouncing from the shadows.
                    you quiver in fear. the
                    streetlight flashes on
                    something shiny in his hand--
                    a knife?

          suddenly fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
          weapon. the jurors recoil.

                                 fletcher (cont'd)
                    and in that terrifying instant
                    you do what any respectable
                    citizen would -- you defend
                    y ou rse lf. only after you
                    shatter his arm and collarbone
                    do you realize it's all a
                    mistake... the man was merely
                    walking away from an atm
                    machine, the apparent flash of
                    metal caused by his bank card.
          he reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.

                                fletcher (cont'd)

                           (concerned)
                    as you stand over his
                    crumpled, though potentially
                    still-dangerous form, your
                    he art goes out to him. you
                    want to help. first, you
                    gather up the many bills he
                    dropped, to stop them from
                    bl owi ng away. second, in an
                    effort to get the name and
                    number of someone to notify,
                    you take his wallet. finally,
                    you leap into the man's lexus
                    to head for assistance, when
                    suddenly a police car speeds
                    up. you breathe a sigh of
                    relief: "someone to look -after
                    the injured man! oh joy!"
                    but do the police applaud your
                    initiative? do they hail your
                    heroism? no-- they arrest you
                    and throw you in the slammer!
          he walks along the jury box:

          

                              fletcher (cont'd)
                  Â· and why? why does the state
                   turn its massive power against
                   this individual?
                         (takes an

                          impressive
                          moment, then
                          answers his own

                          question:)
                   discrimination,
                         (to a black

                          juror)
                   but this time it's not based
                   on race.
                         (to a female

                          juror)
                   not based on gender.
                         (to a man wearing
                          a crucifix)
                   not based on religion,
                         (to a heavy set

                          juror)
                   no--this time it's
                   discrimination based on size!
                 . i know what the prosecution
                   wants you to think - - i t ' s
                   always the big guy's fault.
                   is that what we've come to as
                   a society -- persecuting
                   people because they're large?
          fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.

                               fletcher (cont'd)
                   shame on you, mister
                   prosecutor! shame on you!
                          (turning back to

                           jury)
                   the state is trying to
                   barbeque my client on the spit
                   of justice. only you can douse
                   the flames. the decision is
                   your s. and please...don't let
                   your emotions run away with
                   y ou . the fact that my client
                   is a family man, raising his
                   sons alone after the tragic
                   death of their mother, has
                   absolutely no bearing on this
                   case.
          in the front row we see two sad-faced young children.

          

                              fletcher (cont'd)
                    instead, let cold reason be
                    your guide as you decide the
                    fate of this church-going,
                    orphan-rasing widower!
          fletcher returns to his seat. jurors, dab their eyes.
