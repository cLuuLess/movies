          ext. airplane - day


          
          fletcher's driving the stairs trying to catch up with the
          plane. ground workers react.
          soon, the "stairs" are racing alongside the plane.
          fletcher looks for signs of audrey and max but he's too low
          to see in the plane.
          he grabs the tool box'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on
          the accelerator, pinning it to the floor. then, he climbs

          the steps!

          
          the "stairs" sway back and forth as he reaches the top.
