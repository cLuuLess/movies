          she's leaving. fletcher is on the phone and looks very
          harras,sed.

          he wants to say "yes", but he can't.

                    in a way.

                    jumbo's house of junk.
          she thrpws it in the trash and keeps packing.

                         (gives him the

                          finger)

                                 fletcher (cont'd)
                            (into phone)

                    for me, i--
          the phone won't stop ringing.       .Â·'

                               fletcher (cont'd)
                    hold on, please,
                          (pushes two

                           buttons)
                    hello... mom!!
          the phone flies into the air. he catches it.

                              fletcher {cont'd)
                    mom... well, i wasn't actually
                    on vacation... because i
                    didn't want to talk to you...
                    because you insist on talking
                    to me about dad's bowel
                    movements -- size, color,
                    frequency... i'll call you
                    later... no, not really.
          he pushes -two more buttons. then screams.

                              fletcher (cont'd)
                    oh dammit! i cut him off! i
                    cut off the judge! greta...
          he falls to his knees.

                              fletcher (cont'd)
                    i'm on my knees in a nine
                    hundred dollar suit. don't
                    leave.
          greta stops.     she seems to consider.

                                 greta
                    a few years ago a friend of
                    mine had a burglar up on her
                    roof.

                                 fletcher
                    yes?

                                greta            ..
                   a burglar. -he fell through
                   the kitchen skylight and
                   landed on a cutting board on a
                   butcher's knife, cutting his
                   l e g. he sued my friend. the

          
                    burglar sued my friend.
                    thanks to guys like you-- he
                    won. my friend had to pay him
                    six thousand dollars. is that
                    justice?

                               fletcher
                    no. . . but what' s your poijit!

                               greta
                    my point is, it's hard to get
                    justice. but this is justice,
                          (pinches his

                           cheek)
                    have a nice day in court,
                    bubbie.
          she leaves.   fletcher starts to give chase...

                                 fletcher

                    greta--
          he runs directly into miranda.

                                 fletcher
                    aaaah!
          miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.

                                 miranda
                    ah, fletcher, so nice to bump
                    i nto you. are you busy?

                                 fletcher
                    extremely.

                                 miranda
                    good. would you follow me,
                    please?
          highly nervous, fletcher follows miranda down the hall.

                               miranda (cont'd)
                   fletcher, did you know that
                   the partnership committee is
                   being headed up by mr. allan
                   himself?
                         (off his wary

                          nod)
                   say, you used to work directly
                   for mr. allan, didn't you?
                        (off his waried

                          nod)
                   tell me, what do you think of
                   him?

          

                              fletcher

                         (helpless)
                    he's a pedantic,
                    pontificating, pretentious
                    bastard, a belligerent old
                    fart, a worthless, steaming
                    pile of cow dung.

                              miranda

                         (grinning)
                    how delightful!
          she swings open a door, ushering fletcher into --
