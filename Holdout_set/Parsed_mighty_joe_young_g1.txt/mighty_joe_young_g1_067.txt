news report, absolutely riveted.  he is polishing a
leather object that we can't clearly make out.   garth
stands behind him.

(amazed)
my god.  pindi was right.
reporter (v.o.)
... joe's remarkable size made him
a natural target for poachers.
fortunately the california animal
conservancy's program in...
the program continues with more shots of joe.  strasser is
overcome with desire.
strasser
(transfixed)
he's beautiful.  the most
beautiful animal i have ever seen.
garth
and the most valuable, that's for
sure.
strasser
i want him.  he belongs here with
me.
garth
(thinking it over)
it'll be a bit tricky, won't it?
they're not gonna want to part
with...
strasser
wait!  be quiet!
strasser points to the television...
on tv
intercut with shots of joe are shots of the conservancy
staff.  jill is among them, and her look of displeasure
with the photographing of joe makes her stand out from the
staff.  this shot is replaced with side by side photographs
of jill and her mother, ruth.
reporter (v.o.)
... was raised from infancy by
jill young, the daughter of famed
primatologist ruth young.  their
closeness stems from a tragic
bond.

reporter (v.o.cont'd)
both joe and jill's mothers were
killed by poachers, twelve years
ago, in the pangani forest,
orphaning them on the same night.
on strasser
emotion surging through him.  he realizes now, all at
once, exactly who joe and jill are.
garth
(surprised)
bloody hell.  that's the little
monster that...
garth stops abruptly, glancing at strasser's hand.  he
knows better than to mention it directly.  strasser looks
down...
closeup - strasser's hand
tanned, manicured, and missing the thumb and forefinger.
the leather he's been polishing this whole time is his
prosthetic hand.  he straps it back on.
strasser
(softly, to himself)
i am always amazed how, if you
wait long enough, the opportunity
for justice finally comes.
garth watches his boss, who seems lost in his private
dream of revenge.  it's a moment before strasser looks
back at him.
strasser
book us two tickets to america.
we're going to pay a visit to
this incredible animal.
he looks back at the tv, where jill is on screen.
strasser
i think i know how to convince his
current owners to part with him.
and on that foreboding note...
