ext. infirmary - later
27
gregg walks gingerly out of the infirmary, looking like
crap.  he squints in the bright midday sun, then spots...
the humvee, a mere shadow of its former self, parked
right near the infirmary, covered with a tarp.  gregg
pulls the tarp back to find all his expensive equipment,
a good deal of it broken, pitchforked into the back.  he
scowls.
he starts rummaging through the stuff, looking for some-
thing in particular.  then he finds it -- his video
camera, covered with mud, but seemingly in good condi-
tion.  he pushes the record button.  light goes on.
still works.
he pops open the tape slot, and his face falls.  the
video cassette has been removed.

damnit.
just then, a group of village schoolchildren dash by
gregg.  they are giggling, as if they had dared each
other to run up to the stranger.  they sing out the one
english word they know as they pass:
school children
hello!  hello!  hello!
gregg shakes his head, smiling, and follows them with his
eyes as they fly by like a flock of birds.  he watches as
they dart into the open air market, playfully knocking
aside a familiar individual:
kweli.  we watch from...
gregg's pov
as kweli steps into a fruit stall, letting the kids fly
by him.
then gregg's eyes widen as a tall and lovely young
woman steps into view next to kweli.
back to scene
he watches as they shop together, realizing that this is,
in fact, the beautiful young woman who saved him.
