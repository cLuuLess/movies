ext. waterfall - continuous action
31
jill comes out into a clearing, bordered by a large pool
at the base of a magnificent waterfall.  she pulls a
flashlight out of her back pack and, in the same motion
her mother used to summon her, begins waving it back and
forth into the surrounding forest.
gregg
watches this bizarre ritual, wondering what jill could
possibly be doing.

joe's pov - deep in woods
the beam of light cuts through the deep green darkness of
the trees.
back to scene
jill continues waving the flashlight, waiting for a
response.  then, we hear the sound of something large
approaching.
on gregg
the thunderous sound making him nervous...
on jill
not so jill.  she waits calmly, at first, as the foot-
steps approach.  then, as the branches begin to bend and
break, and we get our first glimpse of fur, she smiles.
mighty joe young emerges from the brush, not growling,
not threatening, but rather looking like a puppy coming
to greet his master.

jill
(cooing to joe)
hey, handsome.  how are you?
on gregg
absolutely thunderstruck, watching in awe as the giant
gorilla bows his head so jill can scratch behind his ear.
he makes low, guttural sounds that are the gorilla
equivalent of a purr.
jill inspects joe, checking him to see if he's okay.  her
voice is full of gentle concern and worry.
jill
what were you thinking yesterday,
letting those men see you?  don't
do that again, okay?  please.
(praying to herself)
please.
we see the fear in jill's face, knowing that joe can't
understand what she's saying.  she shakes it off and
brightens.  she gives joe a playful tussle, then covers
her eyes with her hands.
jill
one.  two.  three.  four...
it takes only a moment for joe to respond.  his eyes open
wide, he looks in every direction then, suddenly, crashes
into the woods!
jill
... seven, eight, nine, ten.
(yelling)
ready or not, here i come!!
and jill runs into the woods after joe.
