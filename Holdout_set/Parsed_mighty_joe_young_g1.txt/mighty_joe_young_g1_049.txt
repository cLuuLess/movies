ext. back of trailer

jack and vern nervously raise the gate to the back of the
trailer.  the gate lays flat against a retractable plank
that creates a bridge to the habitat.
joe growls softly from inside.
jack
easy, big boy.
vern
don't forget who's gonna feed you.
they raise the gate completely.  jill comes up behind
them.
jill
i'll take it from here.
jack and vern are only too happy to let jill take over.
joe's pov - from trailer door
he can hear jill but sees only her silhouette at first...
and the lush greenery behind her.  he growls...
the entire staff, other than gregg, takes one step back-
ward.  harry whispers in his ear.
harry
you sure she knows what she's
doing?
gregg's watching jill with quiet admiration.
gregg
she knows.
back by trailer
jill keeps coaxing joe.
jill
come on, joe.  come on, big guy.
shadow
passes over the staff of the conservancy.  a look of
absolute wonderment on every face as joe emerges from the
trailer.  cecily nudges harry, whose jaw is slack. gregg
sees this reaction, and beams.

joe takes a step forward.  he looks out across the plat-
form into the sanctuary -- taking in the familiar trees
and flowers the staff has planted for him.
on harry and cecily
completely overwhelmed by the sight of this massive
creature.  cecily manages a few words.
cecily
that is one, big gorilla.
back to joe
his head turning sideways at the sound of her voice.  a
tense moment, as joe glares at the assembled crowd.  he
is magnificent.  awesome.  staggering.
harry knows a photo-op when he sees one.  he whispers
loudly to vern:
harry
hey!  what do i pay you for?  get
some shots -- of me, too.
vern picks up a camera and scrambles to get into
position -- but he's so nervous that he trips, sprawling
on the ground and startling joe.  joe turns and scampers
back into the trailer.
vern gets back on his feet, red-faced.  jill glares at
harry.  gregg just chuckles at the stupidity.  harry
blames vern.
harry
what -- he did it.
by trailer
jill walks to the edge of the trailer.  she coos into the
darkened interior.
jill
come on, ya big baby.  come on
back.   do i have to come in there
and get you myself?
she heads into the trailer after him.  harry and cecily
exchange incredulous looks.

inside trailer
we can hear joe making panting and hooting sounds, almost
as if he is trying to reason with jill.  jill coos and
makes her own soothing sighs and sounds.  their noises
bounce off the metal trailer walls.
outside trailer
everyone exchanges curious glances.  miss young is one
strange girl.  gregg just smiles.
a moment passes -- and then the trailer begins to rock
as jill backs out of it, followed by joe.  she leads him,
walking backwards, down the platform, then steps off so
he can pass.
jill
(soothing)
that's it.  that-a-boy.
joe hesitantly takes a few steps forward on his own.
gregg
(under his breath)
go on, joe.  go on.
everyone holds their breath as joe completes the crossing.
gregg looks over at jill.  her eyes are glistening.
joe heads up through the back of the habitat, already
investigating his new home.  everyone exhales.
harry
alright.  take the platform away.
jill is instantly alarmed.  she turns to harry.
jill
hold on -- i'm going in with him.
harry shakes his head and motions for the workers to
proceed with removing the platform.
harry
no.  we can't allow that.  we
don't have insurance to cover
anyone in there who's not an
employee.
gregg
harry...

jill
but you said -- i'm in charge of
joe.
harry
yes.  and i'm in charge of this
facility.
jill looks over at gregg, distraught.  gregg shakes his
head, disgusted -- he sees exactly where this is going.
