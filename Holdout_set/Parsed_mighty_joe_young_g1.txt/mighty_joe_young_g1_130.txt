ext. ferris wheel - near top

joe climbing with all his strength, comes to the top of
the ferris wheel.
on jason -- staring, wide-eyed, at this miraculous
animal.  he watches, in awe, as joe extends a massive
hand and lifts him out of his seat.
on ground
all eyes watch, in awe, as joe presses jason to his
massive chest.
on jill -- smiling through tears.  gregg puts an arm
around her.
behind them
camera crews from local tv news stations have poured into
the park.  they film all of this.
at base of wheel
the wood attached to the metal supports has completely
burned through.  with a terrible cracking sound, the
supports begin to tear away.
another explosion rocks the wheel.  it shudders.
jason's mother
oh, please, no...
widen shot -- the ferris wheel begins to tip over.
on jill -- a look of horror passes over her face as well.
gregg
it's going to tip!  everyone back
up!
everyone starts backing away from the wheel.
the wheel seems to fall slowly -- like in a dream --
sending debris and flames spilling across the park.
on joe
as he cradles jason tight in his arms.
the wheel begins to fall towards the ground.

joe jumps away from the burning wheel --
pov shot
as the ground comes rushing up at him.
joe
hits hard, just clearing the falling wheel by inches.  he
doesn't move.
pan the crowd -- an eerie silence falls over everyone.
the only sound the crackling of the fire.
jill
breaks free from gregg and runs toward joe.  jason's
mother races with her.
on joe
motionless on his back.  still cupping the boy, nestled
and protected against his massive chest.  a beat -- then
jason looks up from joe --
jason
mom?
jason's mother bursts into joyous sobs as her son climbs
into her arms.  a general sense of relief passes through
the crowd, except for...
jill
she kneels by joe stroking his great chest.  joe doesn't
respond.  jill bows her head and cries deeply.
people back away to give her room.  how strange to see
this huge, powerful animal stilled.
gregg comes and kneels by joe's side.  he checks for a
heart beat.  for wounds.  joe doesn't stir.  gregg is
devastated, too.
pan crowd...
firemen, paramedics and television reporters run through
the park.  the paramedics lead off the wounded.

still holding her boy, jason's mother comes forward.  she
recognizes what jill is going through her own version
of mother's grief.  she approaches respectfully...
jason's mother
i'm so sorry...
jill is beyond comfort.  she's in another world.  humming
their lullaby, she rests her soft cheek in joe's giant paw
for the last time.  her blonde hair spills on his
fingers...
and then, slowly entering frame, a giant finger reaches for
jill's cheek and strokes it gently...
it takes jill a moment to realize she hasn't imagined
this... she opens her eyes, sees the moving fingers, turns
to look into joe's face, just as his eyes open...
elated, jill moves up to joe's head and kisses his face a
thousand times.  gregg takes a deep breath, privately
thanking god.  jason's mother is tearful ! -- jason is all
smiles.
jill tearfully blathers soothing words...
jill
(kissing joe's
 head)
that's right, joe ! -- that's
right, big guy.  that was a big
fall but you're okay, aren't
you?  you're tough.  you're so
tough.  yes you are.  yes you are.
gregg
(checking joe over)
we've got to get him checked
out.
(looking around
 at crowd)
and get him somewhere safe.
jill looks at gregg with a heavy heart.
jill
(bitter/rhetorical)
somewhere safe?  where is that?
jason's mother breaks in timidly.

jason's mother
(stammering)
perhaps... i mean, maybe...
isn't there anything we can do?
jason pushes in front of his mother.  he reaches out his
little hand and pets joe.  he looks up at jill and gregg
with a shining face and smiles hopefully.
(alternate end of scene)
jill shakes her head at the mother and continues to pet
joe softly.
jill
(kindly)
no.  i don't think so.  not unless
you have a few million dollars on
you to buy him a home somewhere.
jason's mother nods hopelessly, comprehending the
difficulty of the situation.  but jason has also heard
jill's words.  he pushes in front of his mother, reaches
into his pocket and pulls out a crumpled dollar bill.  he
hands it to jill and gregg with a shining face and smiles
hopefully.
jason
here.  for joe.
gregg and jill are moved by the gesture.  gregg respect-
fully takes the dollar from the little boy while everyone
looks on.
gregg
thanks.
gorman and his men exchange glances, also touched by the
little boy's deed.  now gorman reaches into his pocket and
pulls out a ten.  he comes forward and hands it to gregg.
gorman
for joe.
now the other cops are reaching into their pockets.  they
come forward with dollars in their hands.
cops
here.  for joe.
gregg's hands and pockets are being stuffed with money as
dozens of people begin to come forward with whatever they
can afford.  gregg looks at jill, overwhelmed by what's
happening, and her face echoes his emotions...
