close on the sleepy face of a shaggy yak.  pull back to
a small group of v.i.p.s being led on a tour by harry.
harry
this fellow is one of only three
hundred wild yaks remaining on
the planet.  there are those who
would ask, why should we care if
this sub-species of yak survives?
we spot a man blending in with the group.  we recognize
garth.  he looks quite respectable in a suit.  the antsy
v.i.p. next to garth interrupts harry.
v.i.p. #1
excuse me.  can we see joe?
the other v.i.p.s echo this wish.  harry refocuses
himself.
harry
(charming)
you certainly can -- for the mere
price of a 'diamond circle
benefactor ticket' to tomorrow
night's benefit.
the v.i.p.s laugh and groan.  garth takes this moment
to slip away, unnoticed.  harry twinkles at the v.i.p.s.
harry
it's all for a good cause.
