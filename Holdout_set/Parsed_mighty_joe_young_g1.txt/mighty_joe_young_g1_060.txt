joe's habitat
conservancy workers have entered joe's habitat and have
their guns trained on --
joe
who is standing in a clearing, snarling and beating his
chest.  which is scaring the crap out of...
harry
who, white as a sheet, hides behind a tree, his hands
shaking.  he doesn't dare move an inch, for fear joe will
spot him.
by gate
the conservancy workers are raising their tranq rifles,
about to fire, when...
gregg
stop!
jill and gregg come running up behind them.  jill yells
to harry.

jill
harry!  jump out from behind the
tree!
he shakes his head.  no way he's gonna jump in front of
that gorilla.
jill
jump out and say 'you found me!'
gregg
do it, harry!
joe grabs a bush and tears it from the ground...
the guards aim their rifles, fingers on triggers...
and harry, having nothing to lose but his life, jumps
out from behind the tree...
harry
you found me!
there is a tense moment, then...
joe stops growling.  in the next instant, he starts
spinning in a circle, gleefully.  then he dashes off and
hides behind a very tiny tree.
on harry
completely confused.  jill walks up to him.
jill
he's playing hide and seek.
jill starts rooting around in the trees, pretending not
to see joe.
jill
okay, where are you?  come out,
big guy!  where'd he go?
(finding him)
there you are!
he screams with delight, and spins in a circle again.
as it dawns on everyone that she's actually right, and
that he's really playing, the guards start to lower their
guns.  then they start laughing.  an embarrassed harry
slinks by gregg, who can't help but chuckle as he leaves.
