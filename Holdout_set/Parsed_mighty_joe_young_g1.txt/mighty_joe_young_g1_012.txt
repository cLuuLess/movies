ext. forest - night

jill shines her flashlight into the forest.  further up,
someone waves a light back and forth.  like a signal.
jill's face lights up.  she continues running.  suddenly,
jill is bowled over by joe who leaps into her arms.  they
roll on the ground, jill with the wind knocked out of her.
they look into each other's face and both know that the
worst is happening.  they are both silent with fear.
strasser appears through the darkness.  his right hand
wrapped in a bloody swath.  denying the pain.  garth
follows, gun up.
jill and joe lie hiding in the undergrowth.  jill's eyes
tell joe not to make a sound.  they barely breathe.
jill's pov
of strasser's and garth's boots.  jill can hear the sound
of their voices, but their words are indistinct.
back to scene
strasser
(quietly)
she's got to be here somewhere.
she's got that damn devil with her.
garth
(matter-of-fact)
i think you might've hit the woman.
strasser
(shrugs)
these people want to live like
heroes, let them die like heroes.

they are nearly on top of jill and joe, and their words
are now crystal clear.  strasser looks at his bloody,
wrapped hand and stares vindictively into the dark forest
around him.
strasser
that little demon took off my damn
trigger finger.
(in roumanian)
monstrule!
garth
your little 'monster' couldn't
have gone far.  want to keep
looking or...?
strasser
(in pain)
no.  let's get out of here.
jill and joe lie still as stone as strasser and garth
continue past.  once they're gone, joe and jill begin to
breathe again.  then, jill sees a light pop on in the
darkness.  she flashes back.
jill
mom!
ruth (o.s.)
(whispering)
shhh!
ruth suddenly emerges from the darkness.  she collapses
next to jill in the undergrowth.
jill
(whispering)
mom, there were men, they...
ruth
i know, i know.  shhh.
extreme closeup - ruth's hand
we see blood trickle down her fingers.  ruth covers it
quickly so jill can't see.
back to scene
joe, clinging to jill, begins to whimper.
ruth
oh, look who it is.  hello, joe.

jill
he's scared.
ruth
poor baby.  he lost his mommy
tonight.
ruth turns her attention from joe to her daughter.
ruth
he needs someone to protect him.
will you do that for me, jill?
jill is taken aback by her mother's behavior.  she knows
something is wrong, but she doesn't know what it is.
ruth
promise me you'll protect him,
jill.
jill
i... i promise.
ruth takes jill into her arms.  she rocks her back and
forth, humming the lullaby we heard before.
hold on --
-- the three of them, huddled together in the dense jungle,
the lilting sound of ruth's lullaby drifting through the
night air.
camera floats up through the trees until it reveals and
holds on the star-lit pangani sky.  ruth's voice expands
into a chorus of powerful african voices singing the
same lullaby, now transformed into an inspirational hymn.
