ext. bunker - night
84
an animal control officer stands guard outside the bunker.
gregg, cecily, and jill walk casually towards the officer.
the officer straightens up and looks tough.  he comes
forward halfway to meet them.
cecily
(big smile)
good evening.
a.c. officer
'evening.
our three just breeze on by the officer into the bunker.
a.c. officer
hey, wait a minute!
gregg hangs back with the a.c. officer as cecily and jill
disappear inside.  to buy time for cecily and jill, gregg
pretends to take the big lug into his confidences.
gregg
(confidential)
we're conservancy doctors.  do me
a favor -- stay here and guard
the door.
the guard nods and looks confused.  gregg disappears
inside.
89.
