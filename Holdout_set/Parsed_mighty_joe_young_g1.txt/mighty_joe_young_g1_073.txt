gregg, jill, cecily and harry watching joe's rampage from
outside the gate.  jack and vern run over, covered in mud
and overly exited.

bam-bam-bam!
jack
and taking out irrigation pipes.
one good yank -- on comes the
flood.
harry
he just pulled out another acacia
tree.  you know what i paid for
those?
gregg
(to cecily)
do you know what's wrong with him?
cecily shakes her head "no."
cecily
(to jill)
do you?
jill's brow is furrowed with concern.
jill
no.
harry
well could you get in there and
calm him down before he pulls out
the rest of my landscaping?
