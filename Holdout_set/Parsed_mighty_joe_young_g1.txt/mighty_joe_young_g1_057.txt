int. conservancy near joe's habitat - day
56
harry and cecily walk with a conservative-looking man in
his fifties, elliot baker, the chairman of the board of
the conservancy.  harry is working for brownie points,
excitedly pointing out his "important role" in discovering
joe.
harry
i always had a suspicion that the
legend coming out of the pangani
forest might have some truth to
it.  it was just a hunch -- sort
of a gut feeling -- but i sent my
field zoologist to check it out.
cecily shoots a look at harry.  she's not going to let
him grab the glory away from gregg.
cecily
that field zoologist, dr. o'hara,
had a theory -- and joe's blood
work confirms it.  the gorillas in
the pangani carry a recessive gene
that pops up every four or five
generations with this rare form of
gigantism.

(excited)
and that's where the legend comes
from!  that zoologist of yours ! --
what's his name, harry?
harry
(begrudging)
gregg o'hara.
baker
pretty damn sharp.
this kills harry.  cecily snickers.  they arrive at the
fence surrounding joe's habitat.
harry
here we are.
they walk up to the observation railing.  baker cranes his
neck.  joe's nowhere to be seen.
baker
where is he?
harry
(calling)
joe!  here, joe!
(apologetic joke
 to baker)
i told him the chairman of the
board was coming and he promised
to come say 'hi.'
cecily gaps and mouths "kiss ass" behind baker's back.
baker
well i don't see him.
harry
mmmm.  we'll feed him.  that'll
get him to come out.
cecily
uh, harry...
harry
i know what i'm doing.  let's open
the gate.
cecily hesitantly pulls out her keys to the security gate.
