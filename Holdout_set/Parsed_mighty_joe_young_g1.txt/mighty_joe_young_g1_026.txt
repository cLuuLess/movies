over black, we hear the murmur of voices, speaking in
swahili.  picture fades up...

looking up at kweli, 12 years older than we last saw
him.  kweli looks right into camera, then says something
over his shoulder in swahili.

bruised and bandaged, gregg blinks, trying to bring his
eyes into focus.

gregg
where am i?
kweli
the infirmary.  you've been
unconscious for an entire
night.  you're lucky to be
alive.
gregg winces as he slowly raises himself to his elbows.
gregg
strange, i don't feel lucky.
he takes in his surroundings; a simple infirmary.  through
the open door, he can see the village he started his trip
in.
kweli
you crashed your vehicle.  it
is waiting for you outside.
gregg
you're an injury behind.  the
kicker was getting dropped on my
head by n'gai zamu.
kweli chuckles.
gregg
think that's funny?  you should
try it?
kweli
n'gai zamu is just a legend, my
friend.
gregg
no, he's a giant gorilla with a
mean backhand.  there was also
a woman...
gregg tries to get up.  it's an ordeal.
kweli
a woman?

gregg
out in the jungle.  she saved my
life.  a beautiful woman.
kweli gives him a patronizing smile.
kweli
you were dreaming, mr. ohara.
gregg
no.  i never remember my dreams.
gregg sits up in bed and swings his feet to the floor.
kweli turns and heads for the door.
kweli
it would be wise for you to see a
doctor in kimjayo.  i took the
liberty of calling one for you.
gregg
don't need one.
kweli
but he is expecting you.  if you
can drive, you should leave today.
kweli walks out of the room.  gregg squints after him,
sensing that something is up.
