ext. conservancy - next morning
55
cecily runs up to the front of the main building, where
harry is waiting for her.
cecily
where's gregg?
harry
beats me.  he collected his
pay check.  he's probably in some
jungle by now, not using deodorant.
cecily
i think he should be here.  this
is his discovery, after all.
harry
excuse me, gregg's expertise is
pitching tents, not explaining
primate behavior to the chairman
of the conservancy board.
cecily
(disgusted)
know what i think, harry?
harry
i have a feeling i'm gonna find
out.
cecily
i think you're jealous.
harry (o.s.)
of gregg?  don't be ridiculous.
(beat)
i'm crippled with envy.
in the distance, we see a cadillac approaching on the
conservancy roadway.
harry
just once i wanted to go into
the field and find a new species...
mollusk, anything.  instead, he
makes the zoological discovery of
the century.
cecily
and he still has a full head of
hair.
(continued)

harry
that's not funny.
cecily nods to the road.
cecily
heads up.
the cadillac comes to a stop in front of them.  a
distinguished man in a business suit steps out.  this is
elliot baker, the chairman of the board.
harry
elliot.  good to see you again.
baker
harry.  dr. banks.
he claps his hands together.
baker
so?  let's go see him.
cecily
right this way.
