jill walks through the forest, searching for joe.  it
should be clear by now that they are playing hide and
seek.

jill
(theatrically)
oh, my god!  i can't find joe.
where's joe?
she stomps around, pretending not to see him.  of course,
she knows exactly where he is.  he's so big, the tree
he's standing behind barely hides one leg.
close on joe
he can't help peeking.  he loves this.

jill pokes her head around every tree.
jill
come out, come out... wherever
you are!
then, pretending that she just spotted him, she charges
right at him.
jill
i found you!
joe roars, delighted by their game.  jill tussles with
him, then gets a mischievous look in her eye.
jill
bye-bye, joe!
suddenly, she dashes into the woods -- where she's
actually small enough to hide well.  joe passes by her,
moving through the foliage.
in a moment we see how much he fears actually losing her
-- he begins to whimper -- and spins around.  he stands
up to his full height, beats his chest and shakes his
head in frustration.  he can't bear the idea that she is
gone.
a beat, then joe starts tearing bushes out by their roots,
hunting for jill.  he sees one bush rustling, goes over
and rips it out of the ground, revealing...
gregg
standing there, completely exposed, filming all this
with his dented video camera.  he looks up at joe
towering over him.
gregg
oh boy.
joe roars!
gregg stumbles backwards, trapping himself against a tree
as joe advances.  remembering what one should do when
faced with an enraged gorilla.  gregg averts his eyes and
rolls into a ball, assuming the submissive position.  he's
like a pill bug, playing dead, protecting the back of his
neck with his arms.
joe raises his mighty fist -- it looks like he might
smash gregg anyway... but then he hears jill's voice.

jill (o.s.)
(soothing)
joe!  it's okay.
joe stops and turns his head to jill.
jill
now get out of here, joe.  run.
joe looks at her, not sure why her tone's gotten so stern.
jill
run, joe.  run!
joe looks back at gregg, still curled into a tight ball.
he gives him a playful, parting swat for good measure
before obeying jill and running into the forest.
the "little swat" is powerful enough to send gregg rolling
like a croquet ball into a thicket of bushes.  painfully,
he uncurls, plucking nettles out of his legs as jill
approaches.
gregg
(pulling out
 a nettle)
nobody better try and tell me i
imagined this.
jill reaches down to gregg.  he thinks she's offering him
a hand up.
jill
anything broken?
gregg
(checking himself)
no... no.  i think i'm... oh.
gregg's voice trails off as jill reaches for the video
camera, not him.  she examines the camera.
jill
hmm -- it looks okay.  i think
it's still working.
gregg
(relieved)
oh -- good.
jill
well -- i can fix that.

jill smashes the camera into a tree, breaking it for
good.  she drops the pieces onto the ground and takes off.
gregg
(calling after her)
hey -- wait a minute!
