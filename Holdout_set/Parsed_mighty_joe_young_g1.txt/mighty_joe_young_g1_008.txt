strasser leads a breakneck pace through the woods.  garth
looks around as the africans begin to murmur something over
and over.  these men seem scared...
africans
... n'gai zamu!... n'gai zamu!...
garth steps closer to keep up with strasser.
garth
they're at it again.
strasser
mystical nonsense.  there's only
one thing they should be afraid of
on this mountain.
(threatening, to
 the men)
and it's staring them right in the
face!
the men stare back at strasser with equal hostility.
suddenly, garth kneels and picks something from the
ground.  rubs it between his fingers.  deposits it in
strasser's hand.
garth
gorilla.  we're close.
