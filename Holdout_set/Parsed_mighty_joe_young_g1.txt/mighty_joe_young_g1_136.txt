the blue sky above africa.  crane down to see:
an entry gate with the words "joe young wildlife park"
printed across the top.
beneath the gate:  kweli, standing with jill and gregg,
is blowing a ceremonial horn, sending an ancient blessing
into the air.  as he finishes, we hear applause.
pull back to reveal 35 people -- locals, villagers,
friends -- applauding the opening of the park.
voiceover begins:
jill (v.o.)
dear cecily:  i promised to write
you when joe was settled and now i
finally can.  we finally dedicated
the joe young wildlife park last
week and it was one of the
happiest days of my life.  at last
i have kept my promise to my
mother.
under the gate, jill jumps joyously on gregg, and he
whirls her around in a tight embrace.
jill (v.o.)
joe seems so happy here.  i know
he feels that he's safe.
gregg looks o.s. and waves.
gregg
hey, joe -- come on, big guy...
joe comes walking into frame.  gregg smiles at jill, very
pleased with himself that joe responds to him now, too.
jill (v.o.)
he and gregg have become good
friends.  they even play together.
and that jealous rivalry they
had?  it's all gone.
joe swats gregg to the ground and takes his place next
to jill.
jill (v.o.)
well... almost all gone.

not completely amused, gregg picks himself up and raises
a warning finger at joe.  joe looks over at him, and
purses his lips at gregg, as if laughing at his own
rough play.
joe turns and walks away up the hillside.  jill helps
gregg up.  he puts his arm around her and kisses her
hair.  they watch joe go.
jill (v.o.)
it's been a long journey getting
to this place, but joe is finally
home.  i think we all are.
camera pulls back over the crowd of villagers who have
begun singing a powerful african hymn.
as the sound of their singing rises into the mountain
sky, we --
cut to:
aerial shot
tracking with joe, who begins to run now, limbs out-
stretched with energy and joy, claiming his freedom.
the camera rises off of joe to the verdant african
landscape beyond.  joe's home -- protected and free.
fade out.
