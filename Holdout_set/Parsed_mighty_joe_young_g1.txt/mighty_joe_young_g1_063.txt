int. jill's apartment - day
63
a knock at jill's apartment door.  she opens it and lights
up to see gregg standing there.  gregg looks past her into
the room.  she's made some changes; the bed's on the floor
and a few large potted ferns crowd the room.
gregg
like what you've done with the
place.
jill
too bad it's always so cold --
somebody broke my window.
she smiles at him and motions for him to come in.  gregg
steps just inside the door and stops.
gregg
i just came by to tell you that i
think joe looks real good out
there...
jill
i know!  this is working out --
better than i expected.
gregg
... and that i'm hitting the road.
jill looks at gregg keenly.  he's acting like he's got
something to tell her.

jill
where you going?
gregg
back to africa.
(pauses)
for a couple of months.
jill stays light.
jill
no kidding?  when do you leave?
gregg
now.
jill just nods.
gregg is struggling -- this is more difficult than it's
ever been for him.  he tries to be nonchalant...
gregg
it's the job, y'know.  always on
the road.  it's what i like,
anyway -- can't stand to be caged
up...
they meet eyes.  they both know what that means.
gregg
you and joe will be okay...
jill shrugs, acting like she doesn't care either.
jill
oh -- of course.
gregg
yeah.  well...
jill
(overlapping)
see you when you get back.
gregg
(overlapping)
i'll call you.
