a holding room.  a cage criss-crossed by six-inch steel
bars.
joe stares out through one narrow window.  he sees a
bar-striped slice of blue sky.  he reaches up one hand
towards the window ! -- he can't even fit it through the
bars.  he still looks drugged and despondent.  hunched
over.  his head almost scrapes the ceiling.  his breathing
raspy.
on the other side of the bars, jill and gregg hover like
distraught parents.  jill pets joe's fur through the
bars.
jill
joe... look at me.  over here, big
guy.
joe barely reacts.  jill is near tears.

jill
(to gregg)
i knew something was wrong with
him.
gregg
what do you think happened out
there?
jill
(shaking her head)
joe never would have hurt all
those people unprovoked...
something must have got to him.
gregg
something.  or someone.
jill looks at gregg, considering this for the first time.
harry (o.s.)
jill?
they turn to see harry, poking his head in the room.  he
still looks freaked out from the events of the night.
harry
can i talk to you for a second?
jill nods.  she takes one last look at joe, then walks
out of the room, leaving...
gregg, alone with joe for the first time since joe held
him upside down in the jungle.
gregg leans against the cage next to joe.  they have never
been in such close proximity before.  the expressive-ness
in joe's eyes is uncanny -- gregg feels almost as if he
could understand what he's saying.
gregg
(deeply sorry)
well this wasn't in the brochure,
was it?
gregg looks around at the claustrophobic space.
gregg
i promised you wouldn't be put in
a cage.  i'm sorry, joe.  i helped
put you here.  and now i'm going
to do everything i can to get you
out.
gregg reaches out for joe's paw and lays his hand in it.
joe gently curls his fingers around gregg's hand.
