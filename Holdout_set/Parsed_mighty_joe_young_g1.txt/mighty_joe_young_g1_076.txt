day
looking fairly annoyed.
baker
(emphatic)
impossible.
pull out to find:  baker, facing off with jill.  she looks
flushed with emotion as she follows baker around the room,
dogging him.
jill
(adamant)
please, mr. baker -- i wouldn't be
asking you to postpone the benefit
unless i thought there was
something really wrong with joe.
and i do.
baker
from what i heard, you sang him to
sleep last night like a baby.
what's really wrong about that?
jill
i swear to you, joe's still not
himself -- he's nervous and
agitated.  he shouldn't be exposed
to a crowd of strangers right now.
if you would only delay the party
a few more...
baker
it's too late, jill.
jill
(adamant)
no.  it's too soon.

baker gives jill a hard look.
baker
miss young, let me give you some
advice.  stop worrying about joe,
and start worrying about what
you'll wear tomorrow night.
with that, baker gives jill his back and starts a phone
call.  frustrated, jill turns and walks out of the room.
