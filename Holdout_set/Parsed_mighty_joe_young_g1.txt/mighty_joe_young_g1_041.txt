jill watches the clouds rush by the mountaintop.  joe
stands next to her, looking out at the mountain valley
where they've grown up together.
wind sweeps down from the peak.  the trees bow and bend
gracefully.  to jill, the mountain has never seemed more
beautiful.  she looks at joe -- magnificent against the
natural tableau of his world.  she looks at him, worry on
her face about what is about to happen to him.
he looks at her trying to understand.
jill
i don't know what else to do.
crane up so we can see joe and jill against the edenic
mountain vista.
