ext. hollywood blvd - night
108
a rubbernecker sits in his car, a range rover, gawking at
the police all over hollywood blvd.  then a hunting rifle
enters frame, pressing right against his cheek.
the rubbernecker doesn't even seem scared.  he just
shakes his head, annoyed.
rubbernecker
fifth goddamn time this year.
he grabs his soda from the cupholder, his garage door
opener (guy's been through this before) but before he can
reach for his thomas guide...
garth hauls him out of the car and throws him on the
ground.
rubbernecker
hey!  i was going!  no need to be
so pushy about it.
strasser and garth jump in the car and drive away.
