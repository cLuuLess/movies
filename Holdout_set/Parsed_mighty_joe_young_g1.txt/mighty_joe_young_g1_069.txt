harry is waving good-bye to the v.i.p.s, who have
completed their tour.
harry
good-bye.  good-bye.
(under his breath)
throw money... throw money...
jill and cecily drive up in an electric cart.  jill
jumps out, wearing a conservancy t-shirt, and from the
looks of things she's been working hard in the habitat
all day.  she's a lovely mess, head to toe.

she runs up to harry, all energy and smiles.
jill
harry -- see what's in that cart?
that's all we have left of the
lobelia leaves for joe.  did you
by any chance place that new
order i asked for?
harry
(guilty)
of course i... actually, perhaps
i...
jill
(sympathetic)
i wouldn't be surprised if you
forgot, considering you have so
much on your mind.

harry
i'll go rush order it for you now.
jill
(beaming)
thank you so much.
cecily rolls her eyes.  jill winks at her
conspiratorially.
cecily
(to harry)
she's nice.  i'm not.  if you
forget to order something i need,
i'll knock you upside the head.
cecily and harry walk off grumbling at each other like
an old married couple.
harry
i keep telling you -- stop
talking to me like that.
cecily
please.  you love it.
jill smiles to herself.  she turns to get back to her
other business, and almost walks right into:
gregg.  he's been leaning against a wall, and he's
caught the whole thing.
gregg
lobelia leaves.  should have
called me in africa.  i would have
brought 'em back for ya.
jill just stares for a moment, trying to decide how to
handle gregg's sudden reappearnce.  his clothes look
travelled in, and another month in africa has put a
deeper shade of brown on his face.  he's got the ragged
look of someone who's just gotten off a 16-hour flight.
gregg
nice to see you running the
place, jill.
jill nods and starts walking like someone with urgent
business to attend to.  gregg falls in beside her.
jill
you're back early.  what happened?
run out of humvees to crash?

gregg
no -- just wanted to get back.
jill
(frosty)
really?  and why is that?
gregg
guess i missed harry.
gregg smiles teasingly at jill but she's in no mood to
melt that easily.  he continues.
gregg
they want me to show my face at
the fundraiser tomorrow night...
and i guess i got my mind fixed on
a good meal in a fine restaurant.
thought you might like to join me.
jill
(cool)
no thanks.  i still don't want to
leave joe.
gregg
'still'?  haven't you been out of
here yet?
jill
(flip)
what's to see?  beach is that way,
mountains are that way, mexico's
that way, canada's that way...
gregg reaches out and slows her down.  he wants to see
her eyes.
gregg
come on.  have dinner with me,
jill.
(tenderly)
you won't find a better excuse
to brush your hair.
gregg reaches out and pulls a piece of straw from jill's
tossled locks.  she can't help herself anymore -- and
breaks into a slow smile.
jill
i'll brush my hair if you take a
shower.
gregg
(grins)
deal.
