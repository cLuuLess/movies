ext. observation area - bunker - continuous action
83
jill and harry are in the observation area, a glassed-off
room that looks into the holding cell.  harry is still
extremely rattled from the fiasco of the night before.
he's trying to act tough but he's torn up inside, not sure
who he's worried about more ! -- joe or himself.
harry
the city attorney talked to baker.
it wasn't my decision, and
there's nothing i can do about it.
jill
about what?
harry
joe stays in there until they
decide what to do with him.
jill
(freaking out)
in there?  harry, look at him.
he's depressed, he won't eat.  if
he stays in there, he'll die within
days.
harry
so sue me.  everybody else is.
jill
listen, harry, either you tell them
you're getting joe out of there or
i will!
harry
don't you get it?  this is way
beyond you, and me.  joe freaked
out on some very influential
people.  he's a public relations
nightmare.  no zoo will take a
two-thousand-pound killer gorilla...
jill
(interrupting)
he's not a killer!
harry
... and unless you can write a
check for millions of dollars to
buy him a big back yard somewhere,
joe's got nowhere to go.
jill
that's it?  you're not going to do
anything?

harry looks at jill's angry face ! -- he knows he's just
lost her respect and it bugs him more than he'd like to
admit.  but there's nothing more he can say.
he leaves the room, brushing shoulders with gregg,
entering.  judging from the expression on gregg's face,
he's overheard the whole thing.
jill and gregg look at each other with determination in
their eyes.  there's no question in either of their minds
about what needs to be done next.
jill
i need your help.
gregg
you got it.
