17a
pindi is leading gregg down a row of vehicles:  two land
rovers, one with a strange-looking seat attached to the
front hood, and an old, flatbed lorry.  a surly-looking
group of men lounge around on them.

pindi
six men, three cars... everything
you ask for, mr. ohara.
(lowering his
 voice)
all paid for in advance, out of
pindi's pocket...
gregg holds an envelope filled with cash in pindi's face.
he nods towards the nasty-looking men.
gregg
sweet-looking bunch of guys.
pindi snatches the envelope -- but gregg holds onto his
end.
gregg
i asked for experienced trackers.
pindi
these men are the best -- i assure
you.  very best.
gregg allows pindi to pull the envelope away.  he
immediately rifles through the cash, checking to make sure
it's all there.
gregg eyes pindi's men suspiciously, then walks around to
the back of his humvee and flips open the storage boot,
revealing an array of animal-tracking gadgetry.  pindi
looks over his shoulder as gregg loads a menacing-looking
rifle.
pindi
nice piece you got there.  what
are we hunting, elephants?
gregg
we're not hunting anything.
pindi sees that gregg is loading the rifle with tran-
quilizer darts.  this confuses him, but he pretends to
approve.
pindi
ah!  tranquilizer darts.  i agree
-- much nicer to animals than
bullets.
gregg
(indicating tranquilizer
 gun)
your men know how to use this, right?

pindi
oh sure, boss.  only professionals
here.
gregg carefully puts the rifle back, then grabs a pair of
minolta 10x20 binoculars.
pindi
so tell me, boss -- where are we
going today?
on gregg, panning across his field of vision with the
binoculars.  he stops.
gregg
there.
pov through binoculars
the highest peak in the range, playing hide and seek with
the clouds.
back to scene
pindi's men see where gregg is pointing.  they murmur,
trading grim glances at each other.  pindi jumps with
nerves.
pindi
there?  uh, boss, that is not such
a good mountain.  the men don't
like it very much at all.  you
see there is a legend they believe
in, that a creature lives there...
gregg's back to checking his equipment.
gregg
'n'gai zamu.'  the sacred guardian
of mount pangani.
pindi looks at gregg, surprised he knows this.
pindi
you know it?  how funny!
(with dread)
that's not, by any chance, what
you are looking for, is it, boss?
gregg looks from pindi's nervous face to the serious
faces of the trackers.  they are all watching him.

gregg
looking for a legend?  no.  why

gregg takes the car keys from pindi's hand.
