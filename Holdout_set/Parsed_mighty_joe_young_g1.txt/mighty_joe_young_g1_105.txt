back to joe
follow joe down the boulevard, as he moves in a four-
point walk through the intersection and along the
boulevard.
two women coming out of a shop see joe and scream -- that
frightens joe and makes him bare his fangs.  which only
makes matters worse.  he feints a charge -- and one woman
collapses.

joe walks down the street and bumps into:
parked mercedes
whose alarm goes off immediately.  joe wheels and smashes
the car until the sound stops.
close on joe
the lights and loud voices blend into one single tumult ! --
dangerous and threatening.
the sounds of sirens tell us the police are coming fast ! --
a block away we see two black & whites screech into view.
through the crowd we see a street kid, ray, 13, come face-
to-face with joe.  his eyes go wide with the wonder of joe.
ray
whoa... hey, joe!
it's as if he's seeing a completely different animal than

jill's eyes.
ray looks down the street at the approaching cop cars and
back at joe.  he understands the danger.
ray points the right way for joe to go, away from the
police cars.  joe watches ray closely, as if he were
studying the boy's face.  then he moves off in the
direction ray was pointing, towards:
