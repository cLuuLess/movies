ext. river bank
32a
jill is making good time down the rough terrain of the
river bank.  gregg catches up to her.
gregg
hang on a second -- what's the
problem?
jill
you.  you're the problem.  that's
the second time i've stopped you
from being ripped in two -- and
next time i'm just going to watch.
understand?
gregg
(appeasing)
you saved me.  i'm grateful.  now
i just want to talk to you -- miss
young.
jill stops in her tracks and shoots gregg a surprised
look.  he explains gently.
gregg
i know who you are.  i read all
your mother's work.  books...
notes... everything i could get a
hold of.
jill
(hiding emotion)
so?
gregg
so it's why i'm here.
jill gives a short nod, accepting this tribute.  she
turns back around and resumes walking.  gregg follows,
bursting with questions.

gregg
she knew about joe?  did she have
a theory on him?  how old is he?
i can't believe you kept him a
secret all these years.  how'd you
manage that?
jill
by keeping people like you off the
mountain.
gregg
you got this all wrong.  i want to
help you.
jill
you're not helping anybody here.
you're just making matters worse.
gregg
how's that?
jill
this mountain will be crawling with
people, thanks to you.  you go back
to wherever you're from, put the
word out...
gregg
the word is out.  it's done.  i'm
not the only one who saw him, remember?
rare animals mean big money and joe's
as rare as they come.  it's going to
be tough to protect him here.  maybe
impossible.
jill spins on him.
jill
'here' is joe's home.  and 'here'
is where he must live.  he doesn't
have a choice.
gregg
that's not true.  place that sent
me could take care of joe.  they
got the facilities...
jill
just what joe needs.  a cage.
(continued)

gregg
not a cage, a preserve.  a place
where he'll be free from poachers,
free from land development...
jill
but he won't be free.
gregg
how long do you think joe will
stay free here?  i'm telling you
there's gonna be a hunt starting
on this mountain tomorrow.  and i
don't expect they'll give it up
until one of them bags the prize.
you should think about it.
jill hates the ring of truth in gregg's words.  she turns
and takes off down the mountain alone.
