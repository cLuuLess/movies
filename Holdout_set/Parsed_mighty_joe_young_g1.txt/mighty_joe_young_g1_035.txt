int. back room (raha) - continuous action
35a
... a room that would give dear mr. anderson nightmares.
a man in a white smock is packaging poached rhino horns
into boxes.  the boxes, labelled medical supplies, are
being sent to addresses in china.
on another wall, in front of a bank of telephones, is a
dry-erase board covered with animal names, and their
respective prices.
strasser
see what our friends in china will
give us for a bengal tiger, garth.
strasser hands garth the photo of the tiger.
garth
looks like a big fellah.
(excited, looking
 at photo)
i'll set a new record with you.
strasser picks up one of the phones.  he idly plays with
a rhino horn as he talks to pindi.
strasser
strasser.
pindi (o.s.)
it's about time already!  you know
how long i am waiting?  a man can
only carry so much change...
strasser
(irritated)
what do you want, pindi?
