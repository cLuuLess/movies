int. tent - night
76
a small, elegant and tasteful party.  a collection of
fifty vips, all dressed to the nines, mingle with the
conservancy staff.  tables have been arranged in a
wide semi-circle around a podium, which is on the moat
edge of the tent.
by bar
gregg, wearing a tuxedo, walks up to cecily and harry,
also in black tie.  harry is stuffing his face.
cecily looks admiringly at gregg.
cecily
don't you clean up nice.
gregg
cecily -- you're ravishing.
harry -- you got shrimp on your
shirt.
harry looks down at his shirt smeared with cocktail sauce.
harry
(dismayed)
of course.  i look ridiculous.
cecily
no.  you look fine.
(pointing at
 jack and vern)
they look ridiculous.
jack and vern are off the dweeb-scale in their ill-fitting
tuxes.  they crowd the food table, gobbling down
appetizers.
harry
hel-lo.  look what we have here.
gregg and cecily turn to see what harry's looking at.

by entrance
jill has just stepped into the tent, looking absolutely
stunning.  all heads turn too look at her.  intimidated,
she falters at the door, too afraid to enter.
back on staff
like everyone else in the room, cecily and harry admire
jill.  gregg is rendered speechless by her beauty.
cecily
(proud)
i picked out the dress.  aren't i
smart?
gregg
brilliant.
gregg picks up a glass of champagne for jill and starts
crossing the room to her.
cecily
shut your mouth, harry -- you're
catching flies.
on jill
feeling terribly insecure, jill gratefully watches gregg
cross the room towards her.  they can't take their eyes
off each other.  when he reaches her side, she grabs on
to him.
jill
(self-conscious)
tell me the truth -- do i look
stupid in this?  everyone is
staring at me.
gregg
(reassuring)
they're not staring at you.
(looks around)
they're staring at that... uh...
banana tower.
jill turns and sees a ridiculous-looking decorative
mountain of bananas sitting on a table top just behind
her.  it's the creation of an over-zealous caterer.
jill blushes, realizing gregg's joking.

jill
very funny.
across room
strasser and garth observe the crowd.
garth
quite a turnout they have here.
strasser
all the better.
baker (o.s.)
ladies and gentlemen, can i
have your attention, please?
strasser puts his drink down, taps garth.
strasser
let's go.
the two of them head for the exit.
at podium - with baker
baker
when was the last time you laid
eyes on something so unique, so
spectacular, that it literally
took your breath away?  well,
prepare yourselves, for tonight
you will have such an experience.
with strasser and garth
heading for the exit, they hear baker's words and exchange
a knowing glance -- if they have their way, tonight will
be more of an "experience" than baker is bargaining for.
garth slips his hand into his jacket, checking for the
dog collar...
just as jack and vern start coming the other way.  jack's
already had one glass too many, and he's reckless on his
feet.
jack
(to vern)
there's nothing in this punch,
man.  i could drink twelve of
these and not feel a thing.

smack!  jack collides with garth, causing garth to drop
the dog collar.  vern stoops to retrieve it, (picking it
up by a rusty key that is one of the clanking objects on
the collar).
vern
sorry!  here's your... uh... key
chain.
garth grabs it back.  strasser nods coolly to vern and
jack.
strasser
thank you.
vern and jack stumble on, none the wiser.
strasser and garth slip out.
