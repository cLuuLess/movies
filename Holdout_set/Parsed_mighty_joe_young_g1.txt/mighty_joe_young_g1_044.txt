gregg drives.  jill, almost bouncing with anxiety and
excitement, rides shotgun.
jill
there are more cars on this
road than i've seen in my
entire life, total.
gregg
welcome to l.a.
jill whips around in her car seat and peers anxiously
through the back window.
jill's pov
we see the cab of a large trailer following their car.
back to scene
jill
(anxious)
think he's okay back there?  i
think he's okay back there.
three seconds pass.
jill
you think he's okay back there?
gregg
(soothing)
don't worry.  he's doing fine.
jill
sorry.  i'm a little tense.
(checking behind
 her again)
yeah.  i think he's okay back
there.
gregg
good.  thanks for the update.
jill pulls herself away from the back window and faces
front again.  she stares out at the nondescript sprawl of
greater l.a.  it looks like non-place.  there is no
"there" there.

jill
so this is l.a.
(perplexed)
it all looks the same.  how do you
know where you are?
gregg
beach is that way, mountains are
that way, mexico's that way,
canada's that way.  don't worry
about the rest -- you'll never see
it through the smog.
gregg glances over at jill.  she is drumming her fingers
in her lap with nerves, not listening to a word he's
saying.
gregg smiles with empathetic amusement.
gregg
maybe you better check and see if
joe's okay back there.
jill obediently whips around in her seat to check for
joe -- then realizes gregg was teasing.  she settles back
down, facing front again.
jill
(blushing)
ha ha.
