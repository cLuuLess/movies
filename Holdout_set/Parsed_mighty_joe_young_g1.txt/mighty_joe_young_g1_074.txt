ext. joe's habitat - night
72a
jill has done her job.  joe is calm but spent, leaning
against a tree.
jill sits in his lap, softly singing the same lullaby
we heard her mother sing to her 12 years ago.
she caresses the palm of joe's giant leathery paw, her
tiny white hand almost disappearing in its black folds.
gregg watches, leaning against a tree not ten feet away.
it is the most intimate moment between jill and joe that
he has seen yet.  the tableau invokes myth:  the beauty
in the service of the beast; the man who has come to
free her.

gregg comes forward... slowly... but joe suddenly lifts
his head and grunts at him, a kind of warning bark for
gregg to stay where he is.
jill doesn't even notice.  she lays her soft cheek
against joe's giant palm.  he cradles her face.
she closes her eyes.
fade out.
