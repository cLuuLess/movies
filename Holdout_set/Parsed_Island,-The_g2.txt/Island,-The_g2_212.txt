214   int . ether control room

      o v e r l o o k i n g the ether, ethercon sits at his console. the hiss of
      an opening door as someone enters. ethercon looks round. he
      greets the technician's arrival with an inquisitive look. then
      the technician takes off his hardhat. a crosshatch on his brow.
      ethercon reacts almost instantly, reaching for the console. then
      instantly freezes as lincoln presses the handgun to his skull.
