144   int . corridor - an upper floor - day

      the doors are set with small glowing orbs at peephole level. like
      eyeballs, watching, as lincoln and ester proceed up the corridor.
      they stop at a door. lincoln checks the number. pauses heavily.
      then looks for some type of doorbell. as his eyes cross the orb,
      it seems to blink. then comes a sound of disengaging locks. then
      the door swings open. lincoln flinches, taken by surprise. then
      frowns as he sees there is no one on the other side of the door.
