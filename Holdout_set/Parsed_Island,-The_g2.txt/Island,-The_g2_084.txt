86   ext . the desert - night

     the perimeter wall silhouetted in the middle-distance. lincoln
     and ester scramble through the scrub, blinded by dust, driven by
     momentum. as ester starts lagging behind, lincoln grabs her arm-

                                      lincoln
                        ester ! we have to keep going!

     but ester resists him, breaking loose from his grasp. lincoln
     looks at her, uncomprehending. until he sees her expression, the
     harrowed stare in her eyes, the labored heaving of her chest.

                                     lincoln
                        ester?

     ester staggers back, losing balance, reeling as if spun by the
     storm. her eyes widening, senses flooding. the howling wind, the
     swirling dustclouds, the pendent gulf of black sky. her reel
     returning her to face lincoln, ester opens her mouth to speak.
     but all that comes is a scream. a scream from deep within, shrill
     and hysterical, the only articulation she can find. lincoln grabs
     her and covers her mouth. fighting to stifle her, rocking to her
     convulsions. but ester keeps screaming. a scream of everything.
