148   ext . street - day

      the skiff buckets off the ramp into a street inlet. then stops
      rocking a little. the interface reports: "establishing uplink".
      on another screen, a road map appears. a red dot plants at their
      point of origin then bleeds into a red line, plotting a course.

      the autopilot scans for traffic, then nudges forward on the
      throttle. the resistors drone, the steering wheel turns and the
      skiff noses onto the street. finding its lane, it drops to
      cruise speed. lincoln studies the interplay of steering wheel,
      throttle and brake. then glances at ester. she's plunged in
      thought, staring off. she turns to him with a haggard frown-

                                 ester
                      the man back there... who looked like
                      you... does it mean i have someone too?

      lincoln looks at her blankly, unknowing. ester stares off again,
      her brow knotting with unanswered questions. but lincoln's gaze
      lingers. her pale skin, her limpid eyes, her hair fluttering in
      the breeze. it's the first time he's really seen ester's beauty.
