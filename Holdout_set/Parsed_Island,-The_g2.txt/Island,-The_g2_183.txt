185   int . underground parking lot - new gaza hospital - night

      the corsair pulls up at the er entrance, lincoln at the wheel.
      katherine gets out of the passenger side. a doctor is waiting -
      50's, caring face. his name is dr. abrams. he looks curiously at
      the man at the wheel. then greets katherine with a hug -

                                        d r . abrams
                      katherine . . . it's good to see you. i
                      haven't seen you since john's funeral.

                                  katherine
                      we l l i've been keeping busy. trying
                      to. thanks for coming down to meet me.

                                  d r . abrams
                      your call was a little cryptic. what
                      is it exactly that's wrong with you?

                                  katherine
                      i t ' s not me... not exactly.

      she opens the rear door of the corsair. ester is lying on the
      back seat. dr. abrams frowns as he notices the resemblance.
