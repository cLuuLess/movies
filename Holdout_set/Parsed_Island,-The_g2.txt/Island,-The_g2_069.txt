71   int . ether control room

     ethercon is working the console keys like a madman. his gaze
     flitting to a subgrid o f the complex, spinning the angles,
     navigating the mesh of lines. his voice comes apologetically-

                                  ethercon (into headset)
                    you're off the grid, sir. give me a
                    second. can you tell me where you are?

     he recoils at the blaring volume of the response.
