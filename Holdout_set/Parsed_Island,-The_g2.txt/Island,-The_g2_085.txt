87   int . bedroom - somewhere - late night

     all is still. just a muted shudder of wind on glass. the room is
     in shadow. all we see is a canopied bed where a figure,
     obscured, lies sleeping. the still is disrupted by a chime. the
     figure stirs, fumbling at the nightstand. a holoframe resolves,
     the light revealing dr. sanger, rumpled by sleep. he peers into
     the holoframe to find the face of merrick, gaunt with concern-

                                        merrick (on holoframe)
                        he n r y . . . there's been a breach.

                                                                h a r d cut to black.

     slow fade up:
