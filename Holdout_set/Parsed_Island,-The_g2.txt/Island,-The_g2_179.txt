181   int . katherine's kitchen - night

      lincoln paces around, feeling useless. katherine considers him-

                                 katherine
                     what do i call you?

                                                                 119.



                               lincoln
               lincoln . my name's lincoln.

                               katherine
               lincoln , i think she needs professional
               help. i think she needs to see a doctor.

                          lincoln
               n o . they'll find her. they'll take her.

                          katherine
               n o t if i don't want them to.

                          lincoln
               you don't understand. they don't want
               people to know about her. either of us.

                          katherine
               the doctor i'm thinking of, he's an
               old friend. he look after john in
               t h e final stages. i trust him.

                           lincoln
               why ? so you can take her baby?

                          katherine
               n o . no, that's not what i want.
o f f lincoln's blunt look, she sighs, lowering into a chair.

                               katherine
               m a y b e i didn't realize she'd      be so...
                      ( c u t s off, a deep pause)
               m a y b e i just didn't want to.      either
               way, i was wrong. i want you          to know
               that. i was wrong... and i'm          sorry.

a heavy lull. lincoln hangs his head, remembering.

                           lincoln
               the y make you believe there's a place
               called the island. then they take you
               upstairs and put you to sleep. they
               cut you open. they take pieces of you.

katherine looks at him, intuiting. she allows a pause, then-

                           katherine
               e v e n if i had taken her baby, i swear
               to you, i'd never have... they give
               you a choice, you see, to extend the
               sponsorship after... after d e l i v e r y .

                                                                 120.



                                lincoln
                     n o . i saw a lot of us go to the island.
                     but i never saw anyone come back.

                                katherine
                     you mean... even if i had extended the
                     sponsorship, they'd have... and kept
                     taking the money? but that's inhuman.

                                    lincoln
                          ( b e a t , a lost look)
                     is it? i wouldn't know.
