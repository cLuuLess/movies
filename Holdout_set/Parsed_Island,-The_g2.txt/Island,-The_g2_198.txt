200   int . storage area - holspar stadium - minutes later

      the blood trail leads down a gloomy stairwell. the game is just
      audible overhead. lincoln stumbles down the steps, clutching his
      bleeding arm. between pain and concussion, he loses his footing
      and falls. he tumbles down the remaining steps to the bottom.

      i n the gloom we   see groundskeeping e q u i p m e n t , supplies - edgers,
      aerators, spray    rigs, drums of insecticides, herbicides. for a
      moment, lincoln    lies stunned. then hears a noise and rolls over.
      he looks up the    stairwell. a shadow is descending towards him.

      w i t h painful effort, lincoln starts crawling across the floor,
      eyes fixed on the shadow. tensing as a handgun noses out of the
      darkness. then a stadium security guard steps into the light -

                                 s e c u r i t y guard
                     you , what are you doing down here?

      n o w he sees lincoln more closely - injured, his arm bleeding.

                                s e c u r i t y guard
                     o h , jesus... are you okay, son?

      lincoln eases a little as he sees the security guard lower his
      weapon. then suddenly the guard is jerked back by the scalp.
      a hiss. now suddenly the guard jettisons the handgun, clutching
      his throat like it's on fire. with a boiling gurgle, he staggers
      forward. streaming with sweat. toppling across a herbicide drum.
      convulsing, belching steam. then suddenly his body falls slack.
      s c h e e r is at the foot of the steps, discarding the spent ampule
      from the syringe-gun. now screwing a fresh ampule into place.

      lincoln turns to him, realizing what he's just witnessed is a
      glimpse of his own fate. he pushes himself upright, bracing.
      s c h e e r looks at him. clutching his bloody arm, barely able to
      stay upright, but still ready to fight for life. he half-smiles-

                                                                                 128.



                                  scheer
                       i'm jealous of you. you have a reason to
                       live. i can't say i've ever had that...

      lincoln holds his gaze, looking deep in his eyes. then, as if
      scared by what he sees there, starts inching away, glancing at--

      t h e guard's body smoldering - lowering, melting through the drum-
      s c h e e r moving forward, the smile leaving his face. a mask of
      hollowness as he moves in on his quarry, the syringe-gun poised.

      lincoln stumbling - collapsing to his knees - hanging his head
      as if in surrender... then suddenly his hand flies up-
      - b o o m - a flash of light as he fires the handgun - recovered from
      the ground - an energy pulse impacting the wall, fizzling out--

      s c h e e r keeps coming, syringe-gun ready, blank-faced, unflinching-

      t h e guard's body crackling into flame - the drum splitting open--
      - b o o m - another flash - lincoln fires again - clipping his enemy--

      s c h e e r keeps coming, a charred wound in his shoulder, relentless-

      t h e guard's body burning - sliding into the sands of herbicide -
      - b o o m - b o o m - b o o m - lincoln keeps firing - more hits than misses--

      s c h e e r keeps coming, blank faced, his body pitting with impacts--

      a blinding flare of light - the herbicide igniting - the drum
      exploding - starting a chain reaction - other drums igniting -
      exploding - fire - smoke - engulfing all in a blazing inferno...
