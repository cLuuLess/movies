183   int . apartment building - evening

      the orbs on the doors eyeball scheer, moving up the corridor. he
      stops at a doorway. rings the bell. tom lincoln opens the door-

                                tom
                     yes?

                                scheer
                     i'm from the sanger institute.

                                 tom
                     i've given you people enough of my
                     time already.

                                 scheer
                     i t ' s just a formality. i need to see
                     your sponsorship contract.

      t o m pauses then lets scheer inside. he crosses to the wall safe,
      taps the keys. then pulls out the contract folder. he offers it.

                               scheer
                     is this the only copy?

                                tom
                     why would i make copies? do you think
                     i want anyone else to know about this?

      s c h e e r accepts the folder. as tom turns to close the safe, he
      sets it down. and grabs tom from behind, by the scalp, pressing
      the syringe-gun into his jugular. a hiss. tom clutches his throat
      like it's on fire. with a boiling gurgle, he staggers forward.
      sweating, collapsing. convulsing, belching steam. then falling
      slack. his skin starts to smolder. scheer pauses, then tosses
      t h e contract folder on top of him, leaving it to burn with him.

                                                                          121.
