189   int . hospital room - night
      ester lies in bed, dozing, looking more relaxed. her oxygen mask
      makes breathing easier. lincoln enters and sits beside her. she
      stirs, meeting his eye with a faint smile. lincoln returns it-

                                   lincoln
                     he l l o , stranger.

                                ester
                     you look tired, lincoln.

                                 lincoln
                     ester...

                                                                     123.



                                 ester
                     i t ' s okay. i know. katherine told me.
      she sits up, lowering her mask. her hand finding his.

                                ester
                     she told me a lot of things. about how
                     they used a tiny part of her to make me.
                     she said it wasn't so very different.

                                 lincoln
                     what do you mean?

                                      ester
                            ( t o u c h i n g her belly)
                     f r o m this... from having a baby.

      lincoln nods. a pause. ester continues, more troubled, wheezing-

                                ester
                     she told me how they use us... and i
                     keep thinking... about the others...
                     the ones we left behind, about how
                     they'll never know... how they'll...

      ester ' s out of breath again, coughing. lincoln helps her put the
      oxygen mask back over her mouth. ester slumps back, relaxing.
      off lincoln's worried look, she smiles at him with her eyes-

                                ester
                     i'm going to be okay, lincoln.

                               lincoln
                     i know.

      but even to his own ears, the affirmation sounds hollow.
