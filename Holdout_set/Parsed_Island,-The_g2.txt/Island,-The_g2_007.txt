9   int . stim bar - centerville - evening

    rainbow light and swirling electronic music. the clientele are
    all male residents. round the walls, poster-sized etherscreens
    display various dancing women, beckoning, text supers flashing:

    - - new at the pleasure center!... or try a mystery date!...
    at the bar, lincoln and jones, freshly showered, each swipe their
    ethercuffs over a scanner. a uniformed bartender notes the readout-

                                bartender
                   jones three-bravo; you got five units.
                   your friend, he's got an alcohol flag.

                             jones
                   so make it a beer and a vita cola.

    the bartender serves the drinks and they settle at the end of the
    bar. scoping for onlookers, lincoln steals a gulp of jones' beer.

                              jones
                   you know, you're going to get yourself
                   contaminated one of these days.

                               lincoln
                   shut up, jonesy.

                              jones
                   so, you up for a rematch tomorrow?

                            lincoln
                   i can't. i got an interact.

                                                                        10.



                                jones
                    with who? that blonde again?

                                lincoln
                    hey, it's an authorized interaction.
                    we're on the same meditation program.

                               jones
                    you want to get flagged for proximity?

                              lincoln
                    no law against friendship, jonesy.

                                    jones
                    quick . . . give me that beer back.

     two census officers ("censors") enter the bar; in wireless head-
     sets and white uniforms, they seem at once clinical and military.
     censor 1 carries a tablet known as an "etherboard". censor 2,
     more imposing, carries a wide-muzzle rifle known as a "stopgun".
     their foreboding appearance is greeted without alarm. as they
     move up the bar, the customers dutifully swipe their ethercuffs
     over the etherboard. now reaching jones, who swipes accordingly-

                                  jones
                    what's going on, officer?

                                  censor 1
                    census check.

     censor1 checks the etherboard; a headshot of jones spins in 3-d.
     he offers it to lincoln who swipes his ethercuff emphatically-

                                lincoln
                    what happened? you lost count?

                             censor 1
                    i hope nobody's drinking off-quota.

                                lincoln
                    vita cola all the way, officer.

     lincoln sips his cola. as they move on, he grimaces at the taste.
