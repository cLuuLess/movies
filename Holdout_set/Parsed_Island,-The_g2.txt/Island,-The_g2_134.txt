136   int . boathouse - encanto park - night

      the refuge of shadow. the collapsed   roof allowing streams and
      puddles of moonlight. lincoln helps     ester onto a rotted bench.
      she slumps down, exhausted, lincoln     watches her, helplessly.
      she's fighting for breath, wheezing     and coughing in deep rasps.

                              ester
                     i can't... i can't breathe... my
                     throat... it's so... dry...

                                 lincoln
                     i ' l l find you some water.

      he looks around blindly. some junk in the corner. he rummages,
      finds a rusted metal box. pries it open, empties the contents.
      gauzes, band-aids - evidently a first-aid box - then a bottle.
      he opens it, sniffs. it smells pungent. alcohol, not water.
      ester suddenly starts sobbing. lincoln returns to her side-

                                 lincoln
                     i t ' s going to be okay, ester.

                                                                90.



                            ester
               n o . . . no, it isn't...

                           lincoln
               i ' l l find you some water, okay?

ester looks up at him, wheezing, tears streaming from her eyes-

                          ester
               an d then what, lincoln?

                           lincoln
               i ' l l find another way. out of state.

                          ester
               an d then what? what if they find us?

                           lincoln
               the n we'll keep going.

                        ester
               i can't... i can't run anymore...

ester folds over, sobbing and coughing at the same time. pitiful
to watch. lincoln crouches, gaining her eyeline, very deliberate-

                            lincoln
               we ' l l keep going till we get there.

ester traps a sob, reading his eyes, something reviving in her-

                          ester
               the island... you mean, the island?

lincoln answers with a brief smile. if this will keep her going
then the truth is redundant. he eases her out of the moment-

                          lincoln
               n o w i'm going to get some water. but i
               want you to stay here. it'll be safer.

ester wipes away her tears, sniffing. her breaths, calming.

                            ester
               don't go yet. stay with me, lincoln.
               stay with me for a little while.

lincoln looks puzzled by ester's request. even more puzzled as
she rests her head on his shoulder, nestling into his neck. he
feels her against him. the warmth spreading through him again.
his arm reaching, as if of its own accord, closing around her.
i t feels right somehow. and there he stays, holding her, looking
out across the dereliction. and the moon rises over encanto p a r k .

                                                                      91.
