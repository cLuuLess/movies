13   int . nutrition plaza - sector four - day
     ravel's pavane plays overhead. the plaza is emptying as residents
     leave for work. lincoln arrives at the service counter. he
     swipes his ethercuff and greets the clerk with an amiable grin.

                                   lincoln
                       just juice today. i'm late for work.

                                  nutrition clerk
                       too bad. i gotta serve the full meal.

     lincoln shrugs, his gaze wandering past her into the kitchens.
     his grin fades as he spots two censors talking to a busboy. then
     the view is lost as he's served an oatmeal and juice breakfast.

                                                                        12.
