156   ext . the heritage park - sunset

      an adobe wall culminates at an arched wooden gateway. lincoln
      and ester approach. they haven't walked far but ester is already
      short of breath. as they near the gateway a holoserve appears,
      like a sentry - native american, buckskins, feathered headdress
      and facepaint. his voice seems as old as the wind-

                                                                     102.



                                    the indian hologram
                     welcome to salt river heritage park,
                     home to the hohokam nation for over two
                     thousand years. the park is now closed.
                     please come back during opening hours,
                     9am t o 5pm, monday through saturday...

      ester steps closer. with the sun hazing through, the holoserve
      s e e m s angelic or ghostly. she's examining his striped facepaint-

                               ester
                     he has marks on his face like us.

      she turns to lincoln with a flowering smile. then rushes up to
      the gateway, suddenly galvanized, squeezing through a gap.
