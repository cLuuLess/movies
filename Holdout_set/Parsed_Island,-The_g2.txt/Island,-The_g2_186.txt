188   int. waiting room - new gaza hospital - night - later

      lincoln stands waiting. there are chairs but he's too tense to
      sit. katherine and dr. abrams now enter. lincoln looks at them,
      expectantly. there's a pause. then dr. abrams speaks-

                                 d r . abrams
                     your friend... she has pneumonia. at a
                     very advanced stage. its progress has
                     been unchecked by her immune system.

                                lincoln
                     c a n you help her?

                                    d r . abrams
                     we have two options... one is a super-
                     b i o t i c . but there's the risk her immune
                     system might bow out of the fight. the
                     other is a nodal transfusion. katherine
                     has agreed to be the donor. but the new
                     antibodies may not conform fully. they
                     m a y decide to attack the baby...

                              lincoln
                     i don't understand any of this.

                               katherine
                     he means that by trying to help her,
                     we could lose her. or lose the baby.

                                d r . abrams
                     or , if we do nothing, both. her immune
                     system is... remarkably unstable. if we
                     don't act, the infection will take over.

      lincoln lowers into a chair. he feels a pain somewhere. he can't
      quite pin down where. or what caused it. or why it hurts so bad.
