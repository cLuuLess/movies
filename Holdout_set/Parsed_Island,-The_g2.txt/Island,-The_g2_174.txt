176   int . crowne's office - sanger industries tower

      silence . crowne sits at her desk. merrick sits across from her.
      waiting. the air stirs as the secretary ushers dr. sanger into
      the office. no greetings are exchanged. sanger just lowers into
      a chair, a little unsettled to find merrick has preceded him.

                              crowne
                     i take it you've heard the news.

                                dr. sanger
                     the bond agents. yes. unfortunate.

                                      crowne
                     unfortunate?
                            (pauses, lights a cigarette)
                     we're way past unfortunate, henry.

                              dr. sanger
                     i thought we'd covered ourselves.

                                crowne
                     the police won't connect the bond
                     agents to us. but that's not the
                     problem. it's the sponsor.

                                 dr. sanger
                     what are you talking about?

                                merrick
                     the male agnate tracked him down.

                                  crowne
                     his name's thomas lincoln. it seems
                     they had a genetic reunion. not a
                     h a p p y one. it was all i could do to
                     stop him going to the authorities.

                              dr. sanger
                     i still don't see the problem.

                               crowne
                     he may not want a police involvement
                     but he's already threatened to file
                     suit. and he's one of the biggest
                     litigation attorneys in the city.

                                                              113.



                            dr. sanger
              that's why we have you, ellen.

                            crowne
              that's why i asked bernard to come out
              here. to find out how it happened.

                       merrick
              i told her, henry. about synesthesia.

s a n g e r casts a betrayed look at merrick. then returns to crowne-

                        dr. sanger
              i t was a marginal problem. and it was
              under control - according to bernard.

                            crowne
              that's not the point. whether or not
              it's a factor in this instance, it
              puts us in breach of the clone laws.

                        dr. sanger
              i t doesn't even touch their genetics.

                           crowne
              i'm talking about self-awareness. the
              virtual humanity statutes require us
              t o give them consciousness to the
              l e v e l of functionality. but not beyond.

this gives sanger pause. crowne drags her cigarette acutely.

                              crowne
              l e g a l l y , we are naked on every level.
              federal legislature, state licensing,
              sponsorship contract... but even if we
              did manage to weather the legal storm,
              we'd never survive the public scrutiny.

s a n g e r absorbs this, calmly shaking a pill from his pill bottle.

                          dr. sanger
              i've spent my entire career facing down
              naysayers, ellen. don't think for a
              second i'm afraid of facing them now.

                         crowne
              you remember cryogenics? at the outset,
              people dismissed it as a rich man's
              folly. eccentric millionaires freezing
              their brains, hoping to wake up in a new
              body.

                                                                114.



                                 crowne (cont'd)
               e v e n when cloning showed signs of
               m a k i n g it feasible, it wasn't moral
               a f f r o n t that caused the backlash. it
               w a s the scope. the scope, henry. when
               t h e size of the customer base was
               e x p o s e d , it screamed inequality - one
               m e d i c i n e for the rich and one for the
               p o o r . the pressure for accessible cryo-
               genics a s good as buried the industry.
                       ( a pause for emphasis)
               o u r graves are being dug as we speak,
               g e n t l e m e n . every passing second, they
               g e t deeper. if we're going to survive,
               w e have to act swiftly and decisively.

                               dr. sanger
               a l r i g h t . what do you suggest?

s a n g e r dry swallows the pill. ellen opens a contract folder.

                          crowne
               o u r security chief - i've been looking
               at his file. ex-marine, served in south
               china - do we think he still has it in
               him?

                               dr. sanger
                     ( r e a l i z i n g , suddenly harsh)
               a r e you insane?

the i r eyes deadlock. crowne gives merrick a sideways glance.

                           crowne
               ` you ever wondered why henry takes
               those pills, bernard? why he doesn't
               avail himself of his own technology?

                         dr. sanger
               an agnate could give me a new heart
               but to get it to function mentally...

                                crowne
               b u l l s h i t , henry. bullshit. you don't
               want to deal with reality. only with
               concept. i may not have been there at
               the start but i heard the stories. you
               wanted in on every aspect of
               construction, from environmental
               design right down to the classical
               playlists. i t wasn't enough just to
               make it work, was it? no, you wanted
               your own little utopia.

                                                                       115.



                                    crowne (cont'd)
                     swanning a r o u n d in your mountain
                     r e t r e a t like some self-appointed
                     d e i t y . but when it comes to getting
                     y o u r hands dirty...

                                dr. sanger
                     a r e you quite finished?

                                 crowne
                     e v e n god has blood on his hands, henry.
                     are you going to watch it all go up in
                     flames or are you going to deal with it?

      s a n g e r crosses to the window, looking down onto the city.

                                dr. sanger
                     you see that street down there...?
                     running east from the stadium. my
                     father used to take me to church on
                     that street. an old spanish church.

                                   crowne
                     what's your point?

                              dr. sanger
                     i didn't know they'd torn it down.
