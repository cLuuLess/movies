15   int . lincoln's workstation - dept. of population - day

     lincoln stares at the fractal on right-visor, at the intricate
     paths of dysplasia. the glazed look has returned to his eyes,
     his pupils, a little dilated. his stare narrows at an errant
     thought. he shrugs it off. but the thought returns, persistent.
     more to dispel than indulge it, lincoln turns to mid-visor-

                                                                       13.



                              lincoln (to visor)
                census file: two-delta, starkweather.
- - t w o - d e l t a , starkweather: 102, sector 4 - day: -- / hr: --

                accomodation status : 102, sector 4.

the tiered boxes resolve, zooming in to isolate apartment 102.
the box shows solid white. lincoln frowns, assimilating this.

                            lincoln
                hey , jonesy. remember the guy who won
                the spin yesterday? his apartment's
                still showing as occupied.

                             jones (o.s.)
                so?

                          lincoln
                so you get 24 hours to move out.

                             jones (o.s.)
                maybe the system didn't update yet.

                           lincoln
                no. it updates on the hour. if he's
                gone it should be showing a vacancy.

                                  jones
                      (appearing over the partition)
                what? you think he's still here? the
                guy wins a place on the island and you
                think he just decided not to go?

                         lincoln
                i don't know. he wasn't there to step
                up. and now there's a census check...
                           jones
                and now nothing. it's probably the
                programmers messing up.

                             lincoln
                maybe.

                         jones
                a stim unit says i can prove it. cross
                reference with sanitation.

                                  lincoln (to visor)
                sanitation status: 102, sector four.

                                                                        14.

                                    jones
                        see ? standard procedure. they got to
                        sweep it for the next occupant.

     their supervisor interrupts them - an outsider, efficient-type-

                                  supervisor
                        if you gentlemen aren't busy... perhaps
                        i could get an update on sector six?

                                     lincoln
                        still in the electrical phase, sir.

                                    supervisor
                        well the guys upstairs are griping
                        about the backlog. so go over there
                        and light some fires, will you?

                                         lincoln
                               (pulls on his jacket to leave)
                        i'll take care of it.

                                         supervisor
                        aren't you forgetting something?
                               (holds up a steel briefcase)
                        or do you want to get contaminated?
