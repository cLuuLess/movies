132   ext . alley - night

      lincoln pulls ester into the shadows - the sidewalk narrowing -
      they run onward, glancing off dumpsters - dull booms of metal -
      a flood of halogens - the cutter banking sharply into the alley -
      pouring on the speed - the quarry trapped in its headlights--

      lincoln and ester - nowhere to run - the lights growing - the
      rising drone of resistors - lincoln sees another opening --

                                                                        88.
