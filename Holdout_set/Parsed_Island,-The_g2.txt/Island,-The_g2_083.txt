85   ext . the lodeway - night

     the red wash of light from the lodeway as scheer races up the
     edge, eyes trawling the trench for his quarry. his pace now
     suddenly dropping, slowing to a halt. he doubles over, catching
     his breath. more white uniforms now appear from the dust as the
     censors, unable to match his pace, finally catch up. the first
     reaching him, scheer pulls upright, bellowing over the wind-

                               scheer
                    g e t me a bird!

                             censor
                    a bird?! in this storm?!

                                scheer
                    the y got out! they got past the gate!

                                                                                  57.



     scheer spins on his heel back towards the institute. the censor
     lingers, confused. then he fixes on the lodeway. floating past
     in the red wash are the luminous blue seams of two ethercuffs.
