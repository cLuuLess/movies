170   ext . the south face - morning

      lincoln and ester hide in the shadow of a rock. ester is muffling
      her breaths as best she can. lincoln now hazards a look over the
      top. two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon,
      now pointing in their direction. he ducks back, assimilating.
      hiding, no longer an option. nor running, at least for ester.
      his face sets in a grimace of conviction. his eyes glow darkly.
