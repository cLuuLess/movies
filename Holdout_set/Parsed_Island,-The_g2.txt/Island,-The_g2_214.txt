216   int. chamber - level twenty seven

      the pale blue light sustains. the chamber is reminiscent of the
      foundation chambers. the walls lined with tanks. but instead of
      amber fluid, these contain blocks of ice. beside each tank is a
      grid of bio-monitors. e t h e r c o n stumbles into frame, prodded by
      lincoln. then, with a trembling finger points to one of the
      tanks. lincoln holds aim on him and considers the glass facet.
      he wipes the condensation off the glass. suspended in the block
      of ice is a shadow. a human figure. a device is attached to his
      stomach. lincoln looks at the bio-monitors. a screen reads:

      " p r o d u c t id: starkweather/ foundation: ii/ generation: delta".

      lincoln looks across the ekg, the cardiograph, indications that
      starkweather is still alive. then he fixes on the rfi m o n i t o r . a
      resonant image of the brain. the shifting aura showing a level of
      consciousness. what thoughts must be going through that mind?
      the fate of the agnates s p a r e d from expiration. to be kept on
      i c e for future harvest. with a haggard look, lincoln rests his
      hand on the glass where starkweather hangs frozen. connecting.
