49   int. extractor shaft

     the deep steady thrum of the extractor fans. we are tight on the
     frame of an airlock. hissing, it indents and opens. lincoln steps
     through, eyes black and uncanny. the tri-key g l i n t i n g , dangling
     from his fingers. scanning around, he fixes on a section of wall.
     he wipes off some soot. legible beneath is a number. twenty. he
     assimilates this. then turns his gaze up the extractor shaft.
