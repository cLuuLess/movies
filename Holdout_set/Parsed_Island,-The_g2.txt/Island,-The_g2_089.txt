91   ext . chasm - the red rocks - day

     the desert sun clefts the chasm into light and shadow. lincoln
     trudges into view, ester lagging behind. he stops to let her
     catch up, only to watch her slump onto a rock. he allows her a
     moment to rest and walks to where the chasm comes to an end.

                                                                     59.



     he surveys the terrain. his eyes roam the carpet of scrub, now
     narrowing on an inconsistency. a faint strip where nothing seems
     to grow. tracing its lineage, he walks a few feet out. then
     drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust.

     his fingers meet something hard. he sweeps off the dust to expose
     a layer of concrete. continuing, revealing the ghost of a line.
     what we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him.
     continuing, opening a window in the dust. now his fingers snag
     o n something. he tugs it and it gives a little, dust crumbling to
     reveal a section of rusted chainlink. a corner of metal is
     visible. lincoln exposes the rest. a sign, barely legible: "us
     government - restricted area". he frowns, trying to assimilate.
     ester comes up to join him. off her anxious look, he decides-

                             lincoln
                    i think i've found a path.
