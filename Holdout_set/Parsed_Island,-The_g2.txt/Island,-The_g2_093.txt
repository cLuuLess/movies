95   ext . scrapyard - sunset

     the dust skims over mountains of rusted scrap. nestled in the
     mountains is a shack. a sign creaks in the breeze "osmund d e e r ,
     licensed salvage merchant". on the porch sits an old man in a
     greasy ballcap a n d dungarees. this is the eponymous owner, ozzie.

     he's sitting on a lounger, surveying his empire, enjoying a beer
     and a cigarette. exhaling a drag of smoke, his eyes crease to a
     squint. he sees something through the smoke, silhouetted against
     the sunset. an approaching figure, wary, like a flighty animal.

                                                                          64.



                                ozzie
                    hello?

     the silhouetted figure doesn't answer, just stares back at him.

                               ozzie
                    can i help you?

     this seems to get a response. the figure ventures closer. we
     recognize lincoln. exhausted, dust-covered and dry-throated -

                              lincoln
                    my friend... she needs water.
