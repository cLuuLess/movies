25   int . containment

     the thrum fading to silence. a flat, measured silence as we
     revisit the community in soundless montage. the residential
     block, the frosted facades. the nutrition plaza, the counters,
     the chutes. the subway, the moving walkways. centerville, the
     buildings now emitting a trickle of agnates, ending their
     workday - unwitting participants in their own greater utility.
