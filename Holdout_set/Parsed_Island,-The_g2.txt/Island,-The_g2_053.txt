55   int . the other side of the door - seconds later

     lincoln waits, ear to the door, listening as the footsteps pass
     and fade out of earshot. lincoln releases his breath in relief,
     calming a little, then frowning as he registers another sound.

     very faint, rhythmic. he turns and looks around. the room is in
     partial shadow. to one side is a row of seats, to the other, a
     row of windows, covered by blinds, light creasing through. the
     sound repeats. muffled. but now unmistakably the cry of a baby.
