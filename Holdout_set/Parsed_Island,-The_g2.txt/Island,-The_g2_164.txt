166   ext . salt mountains - sunrise

      the sunrise depicts two silhouettes, moving across the ridge.
      lincoln and ester clamber over the calcified rocks. ester now
      stops to catch her breath. she is wheezing again, fighting for
      air. as lincoln looks on with concern, she musters a brave smile-

                              ester
                     i can make it.
