                    good morning - this is a community
                    bulletin... following an incident in
                    sector four earlier this morning, the
                    department of sanitation is issuing an
                    all-sector contamination warning...

     tracking the rapt concern of the residents, ester among them.

                               community announcer
                    the incident involved a resident found
                    to be infected with a pathogen. while
                    the risk is assessed, residents are
                    advised to be aware of the symptoms.
                    should you experience aberrant levels
                    of anxiety or witness it in others,
                    immediately contact the medical center.
