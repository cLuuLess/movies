192   int . prep room - night

      a flurry of disturbance from the nurses as someone barges into
      the room. dr. abrams is prepping katherine for the transfusion.
      off the ruckus, he looks up. lincoln comes up to them, urgently-

                               lincoln
                     we have to go. we have to get her out.

                                 katherine
                     what are you talking about?

                                 lincoln
                     he's come for her. for us.

                                     d r . abrams
                     what e v e r this is about, we can't move
                     her. she's already under sedation.

      lincoln look to see ester, asleep on the or table beyond.

                                lincoln
                     how long before she wakes up?

                                d r . abrams
                     the procedure takes three hours but...

                                   lincoln
                            ( t o katherine, emphatic)
                     you'll take care of it, won't you? take
                     her somewhere they can't find her...

      katherine , understanding, simply nods. lincoln takes a last look
      at ester, then departs. dr. abrams, bemused, turns to katherine-

                                       d r . abrams
                     katherine , what the hell's going on?
