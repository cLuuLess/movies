123   int . ticket window

      lincoln and ester step up to the ticket window. a ticket clerk -
      male, immaculately groomed - greets them with a polished smile.

                                     t i c k e t clerk
                      we l c o m e to grey dolphin bus lines.
                      what is your destination, please?

      lincoln squints at him. then wafts his hand across the counter.
      the ticket clerk flinches at the impact. then composes himself.
      a trace of camp as he smiles bashfully at the rugged customer-

                                  t i c k e t clerk
                      i t ' s okay. really. i get that a lot.
                      i'm sorry, now where were we again?

                               lincoln
                      i want to get out of state. now.

                                     t i c k e t clerk
                      b e l i e v e me, i know how you feel. so
                      where did you want to go exactly?

                                 lincoln
                      o u t of state...
                                  t i c k e t clerk
                      j u s t wherever the wind takes you, huh?

                                     lincoln
                      where's that?

                                   t i c k e t clerk
                      we l l , if it was me, out to the west
                      coast. it's perfect this time of year.

      lincoln nods, liking the sound of this. the ticket clerk smiles,
      enjoying the acceptance of his suggestion, he ventures hopefully-

                                        t i c k e t clerk
                      t r a v e l l i n g alone, are we?

                                 lincoln
                      n o . with her.

      he gestures, then realizes ester is gone from his side again.

                                                                     84.



      he scans the faces. the clerk, disappointed, taps some keys.

                                 t i c k e t collector
                      t w o adults, let me see... i'm afraid i
                      can't get you seats till the morning.
