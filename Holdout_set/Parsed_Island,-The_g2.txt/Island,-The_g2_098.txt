100   ext . shuttle stop - night

      i n the middle of nowhere, a canopied platform. not unlike the sub-
      w a y platform, it borders a deeply trenched lodeway. a wave of dust
      rolls in, swelled by the whisper, landed beyond. it seems to bring
      scheer to the platform. he scans around for a clue, a footprint
      perhaps. but somehow he already knows. he looks up the lodeway,
      eyes honing. the deep black line stretches far into the night.
