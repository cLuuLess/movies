61   int . corridor - level three

     the blare of an alarm. starkweather, clumping down the corridor,
     clutching his open stomach, blood streaming down his legs. he's
     delirious, running nowhere, anywhere, running blind. reaching the
     end of the corridor, he stops suddenly, seeing white uniforms.
     he doubles back up the corridor. kicking at doors with bare feet,
     frantic for any means of escape. he spots a ventilator grid,
     slightly open. he jumps, reaching for it. once, twice, then his
     feet slip from under him. he hits the floor with a damp splat.
     two censors turn the corner, ready for action. but there is
     starkweather, face-down in a starburst o f his own blood.

                                    censor (into headset)
                       yeah, no sweat, subject is secured.
