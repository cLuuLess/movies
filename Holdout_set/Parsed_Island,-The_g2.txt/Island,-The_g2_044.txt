46   int . ground floor - residential block
     c l o a k e d in shadow, scheer listens to the play-by-play on headset.
     with a tap, he changes the channel, whispering to his squad-

                                s c h e e r (into headset)
                    g i v e him some space. i have him.
     a n o t h e r angle: starkweather hits the deck running, sprinting up
     the avenue. in bg, scheer steps forth, stopgun l e v e l l e d , aiming--

                                                                             40.



     -boom- the flash of the muzzle, the shrill wail of the hookhead.

     - t h u d - starkweather jolts as the shot hits him square in the
     back, arching as the hookhead b i t e s ; but he keeps on running-

     - b o o m - b o o m - b o o m - scheer unleashes his ordnance, filling the air.

     - t h u d - t h u d - t h u d - starkweather jolts from one, two, three more
     hits; hookheads b i t i n g , spraying blood; but he keeps on running.
                                 s c h e e r (into headset)
                      a l l clear. flood the area.

     a n o t h e r angle; floor level, as between the tiles, tiny red lights
     start blinking, rippling forward in a wave. known as "lode-pins"
     their small magnetic pulses accumulate into a low level stream.

     the hookheads c l a w e d in starkweather's back also start blinking
     red. the invisible stream flowing beneath his feet, starkweather
     feels its force. the duelling polarities stealing his traction.
     his run reducing to a slipsliding s t a g g e r . then his feet leave
     the ground. he flails for a handhold. but there's nothing. the
     force lifts him a foot clear off the ground before balancing out
     to dangle him in mid-air, squirming about like a fish on a hook.

     a n o t h e r angle; scheer advances to reel in his catch. the stream
     bows before him, red lights blinking out. until all that remains
     is the section where starkweather hangs suspended. scheer stops
     at its limit, looking up at him like some curious zoo exhibit.

                                  s c h e e r (into headset)
                      h o o d him, cuff him, patch the bleed.
                      then let's get him up to level three.
     a n o t h e r angle: looking down from high above as the censors move
     in on starkweather. scheer now walking away, tapping his headset-

                                       s c h e e r (into headset)
                      e t h e r c o n ? send word to dispatch.
                      starkweather two-delta is secured.

     r e v e r s e angle: lincoln in cu, looking down. he has seen and heard
     all that has just passed. in his eyes, we see his daze clearing,
     consciousness coalescing, deepening. his pupils dilating into a
     deep and uncanny stare. what can only be described as a dawning.
