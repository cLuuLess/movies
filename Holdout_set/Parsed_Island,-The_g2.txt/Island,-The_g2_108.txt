      lincoln returns to ester with a tray of food and drink. she's
      staring off again, distant. he puts a burger and drink cup in
      front of her. she seems not to notice. he tries to engage her-

                              lincoln
                     i asked the man how to get to the
                     terminal. he said it's not far.

      but ester just keeps staring, her brow now furrowing as a little
      girl skips past, maybe 11, sipping a soda. now lincoln sees her
      too and is transfixed. now the little girl notices the strangers,
      staring at her. she hurries onward, uncomfortable. lincoln and
      ester's eyes follow. it's the first time they've seen a child.
