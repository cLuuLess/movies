224   ext . jetty - the pacific coast - dawn

      a private jetty stretches out to a pile of supply canisters. a
      yacht is moored. we recognized it as john's boat. and we recognize
      katherine, holding the baby as lincoln and ester finish loading.
      the last canister stowed, lincoln comes up to her. he smiles at
      the sight of her with the baby. then prompts her gently-

                                                                       138.



                                 lincoln
                     time to go.
      katherine hesitates, part of her unwilling to let the baby go.
      then she plants a lingering kiss on his downy hair and lets
      ester take him. lincoln presents her with the data tablet-

                                   lincoln
                     you'll make sure this gets out?

                                 katherine
                     yes . there are people sympathetic to
                     the cause. i'm going to get it to them.

                                  lincoln
                     thank you, katherine. for everything.

      he smiles. katherine points to a canister left on the dock.

                                  katherine
                     don't forget that. it has the
                     operating manuals for the boat.

                                 lincoln
                     i've been looking at them for months.

                                katherine
                     but the maps, the charts...

                                   lincoln
                         ( b e a t ; a meaningful look)
                     i don't need them either.
      katherine nods, understanding. nothing more to say, she hugs him.
      then turns to ester with the baby. she folds them in a yearning,
      almost maternal embrace. tears well in her eyes. then the sorrow
      turns to laughter as the baby starts tugging at her gray hair.
