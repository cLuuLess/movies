     povceiling ventilator grid. looking down through the slits onto
     starkweather directly beneath. he now has a loose white hood over
     his head. his wrists and ankles are bound by plastic cuffs. a
     loop of intestine plumps out from his belly. his weight is such
     that the censors have to drag him away, leaving a bloodsmear o n
     the floor. his guttural whimpers are the only sign of life.

     closeup: lincoln's face in part shadow, looking down. the gleam
     of his eyes as starkweather disappears from view. listening now,
     to those feeble whimpers, growing fainter, ever fainter until
     they disappear from earshot. silence again. emptiness. all that
     remains of starkweather is a wending bloodsmear o n the floor.

                                                           slow fade to black.
