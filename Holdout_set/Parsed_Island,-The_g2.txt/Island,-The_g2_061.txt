63   int . bedroom - dawn

     the horizon. the green mountains in different aspect, framed by
     a different window. the bedroom is like lincoln's but with a few
     feminine touches. ester, in her papery pajamas, sits brushing
     her hair. with a chime, etherscreen scales over her reflection:
     - - e t h e r c a l l p e n d i n g ; accept or send to message bank?--

                                                                        49.



                                  ester
                    accept.
     the etherscreen resolves lincoln's face, dishevelled, urgent-

                                    lincoln (on etherscreen)
                    ester . . . i have to talk to you.

                                    ester
                    lincoln ? are you okay? i was worried.

                                lincoln (on etherscreen)
                    what are you talking about?

                               ester
                    the contamination warning. somebody
                    said you'd been exposed.

     lincoln pauses to process this. hunted, more cautious now-

                             lincoln (on etherscreen)
                    i want you to meet me as soon as you
                    can. but you can't tell anyone.

                              ester
                    is it true? were you contaminated?

                               lincoln (on etherscreen)
                    you know where to come.

     his face blinks out. ester is left frowning at her reflection.
