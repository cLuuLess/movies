167   ext . salt canyon - early morning

      a freight barge whooshes through the canyon, trailing a chain of
      low, arched containers, capacious in width rather than height.
      the conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider, deeper, known
      as a "lode-canal". at each end of the canyon, it intersects with
      other lode-canals, converging to use the same passage, a system
      of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic.
      high above, on the south rim of the canyon, we find lincoln and
      ester. ester is no longer wheezing but rasping. she looks down at
      the passing vessel, daunted. lincoln offers her small comfort-

                                  lincoln
                     don't worry. the one we want goes the
                     other way. he said it goes slower.

      they exchange a smile. the chain of containers tailing off, the
      barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon.
