      e m p t y . the grill bar is closed. only the vending machines are
      active. lincoln considers them. not unlike those he used to
      know. he finds one that offers water bottles. the sign reads
      "arctic melt". he pulls out his blue card and looks for the
      slot. then pauses, picking up his reflection in the glass. he
      examines the shadowy growth on his face. then he notices his
      eyes. they seem to be darkening. the pupils, welling open. then
      he feels it. the sense of danger, surging up like a geyser.
