      lincoln bursts out into the parking lot - flashes of light -
      vehicles pulling in and out - off across the parking docks -

      now spotting him across the lot - leaping into a vehicle -

      throttle - lurching out - narrowly missing another vehicle -

      for the exit ramp - he launches towards the straker -
