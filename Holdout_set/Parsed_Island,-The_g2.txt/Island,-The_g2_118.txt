120   int. cutter - streets - driving - day

      b u r d o n steers calmly, scanning the streets. diggs impatiently
      bashes the keys of a holocom on the drive console. a holoframe
      hovers, snowed with static. then a secretary's face appears -
      sagging, older, primped and painted young. her name is janeen-

                     idea how long that's going to take?
