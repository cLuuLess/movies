     a glass wall looks down on the avenue. the furniture is trans-
     p a r e n t , ethereal. merrick sits at a console desk studying an
     etherboard. o f f a buzz, he taps a button. the door opens and
     lincoln enters, composing a deadpan. he doesn't like this man.

                                lincoln
                     you wanted to see me?

                                                                    25.



                               merrick
                   yes . please, take a seat.
he taps     a button. the glass wall frosts over. it's unnerving but
lincoln      stays deadpan, moving the chair before taking a seat.
merrick      reviews the etherboard: lincoln's headshot s p i n n i n g in
3d w i t h   a scroll of data. then he looks up, forming a smile-

                                merrick
                   how ' s lincoln six-echo today?

lincoln shrugs, noncommittal. merrick eyes him thoughtfully.

                                     merrick
                   e v e r y t h i n g going okay?

                            lincoln
                   i guess not.

                              merrick
                   why do you say that?
                             lincoln
                   i f i'm here.

                              merrick
                   i'm not sure i deserve such a negative
                   association. my job's only to see that
                   you're happy. that everything's okay.

                                lincoln
                   right.
                             merrick
                   i t sounds like you don't believe me.

                              lincoln
                   why wouldn't i?

                                   merrick
                          ( s i t s back, smiling)
                   i t ' s part of your makeup. to challenge
                   things. to question what's around you.

                                lincoln
                   ah.

                                  merrick
                   p e r h a p s you can utilize that facility
                   by helping me solve a little puzzle.
lincoln shifts, feeling uneasy. merrick consults the etherboard-

                                                                 26.



                                merrick
                you're doing well in most areas - pro-
                f i c i e n t a t work, exercising rigorously,
                your last medical puts you in excellent
                condition. but screening's picked up
                some deviations. trace levels, changes
                in your sleep pattern... i see you've
                also been burning up your quotas...

                           lincoln
                a r e you saying i'm contaminated?

                            merrick
                no.
                            lincoln
                the n what's the problem?

                             merrick
                the r e are parameters, lincoln. when
                someone starts straying from those
                parameters, we need to find out why.

                            lincoln
                why?

                               merrick
                because you - not just you, all of our
                residents - are special. because people
                like me don't get to go to the island.

he smiles. lincoln stays deadpan, wondering where this is going.

                          merrick
                s o tell me, have you noticed any
                changes in yourself?

                            lincoln
                no.
                            merrick
                what about your sleep pattern? you
                feel you've been sleeping properly?

lincoln shrugs, refractory.

                           merrick
                l e t me put it another way, when you
                wake up, do you feel... disrupted?

                         lincoln
                disrupted?

                                                                  27.



                                merrick
               r e s t l e s s , disoriented, uneasy...
                        lincoln
               i don't know.

                              merrick
               they're all words in your vocabulary.
               i know you understand what they mean.
lincoln ' s jaw clenches, patronized. merrick notes this, resumes-

                                merrick
               quotas . . . nutrition. do you feel like
               you want more than you're given?
                        lincoln
               i don't know.

                         merrick
               do you have any difficulty staying
               focused? at work, for instance?

lincoln ' s jaw twitches. merrick notes this, proceeds with care-

                           merrick
               h a v e you been experiencing feelings,
               sensations you don't quite understand?

                        lincoln
               i don't know.

                         merrick
               do you sometimes feel agitated for no
               apparent reason? frustrated, angry...

                             lincoln
               that's it.

                             merrick
               an g r y ? you feel angry?

                           lincoln
               right.

                           merrick
               when exactly do you feel angry?

                           lincoln
               now...
lincoln leans forward as if to assert this. merrick slowly nods
like he's just revealed something. he taps the etherboard-

                                                                 28.



                          merrick
               i'm going to order some tests at the
               medical center. in the meantime, i'd
               like you to stay away from stimulants -
               protein, sugar, caffeine...

                        lincoln
               i already burned up my quotas.

                          merrick
               but i know you can get around them.

he levels a knowing look. lincoln stiffens again, unsettled.

                          merrick
               i'm asking you to cooperate. not for
               my sake, lincoln, but for your own.

                         lincoln
               is that it?

                            merrick
               the r e is one other thing. you have a
               female friend. "ester". your file shows
               you've been interacting regularly.

                              lincoln
               the r e ' s no law against friendship.

                         merrick
               o f course not. we encourage interaction
               in the hope it'll be of mutual benefit.
               but given these deviations... let's
               just say proximity becomes an issue.

                        lincoln
               i know the rules of proximity.

                             merrick
               the rules of proximity apply to sexual
               contact, lincoln. in this case it goes
               deeper than that. ester is entering
               h e r second trimester. a time of change
               and emotional confusion. further inter-
               a c t i o n might be... unhealthy for you.
lincoln , patronized, looks away. this pill he won't swallow.

                          merrick
               an d for ester - well, she has only six
               months left to delivery. then she'll
               move out to the island and whatever
               ties she has here will be broken.

                                                                       29.



                                      merrick (cont'd)
                    a s a friend, shouldn't you make her
                    t r a n s i t i o n as painless as possible?
     lincoln ' s deadpan falters. this one, a bitter pill, he swallows.

                                 merrick
                    g o o d . now i'm also going to refill
                    your pleasure quota. it may help to
                    settle you down a little.

                                 lincoln
                    thank you. i feel much better now.

                               merrick
                    i'm not sure you do. but i think
                    you'll do what's right, lincoln. you
                    may not trust me. but i trust you.
