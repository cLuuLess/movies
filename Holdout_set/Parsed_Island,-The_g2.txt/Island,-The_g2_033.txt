35   int . the ether grid

     a blue dot blinks in space. we widen to establish its locus on a
     tomograph. now building the boxes, the quadrants, the sectors.
     revealing a vast, fully dimensional hologram of containment. it
     spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom.
