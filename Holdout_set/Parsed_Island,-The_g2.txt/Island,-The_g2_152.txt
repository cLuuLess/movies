154   ext . interstate - sunset

      the sunset melts gold across the horizon as the skiff cruises
      westward. eight lanes of lodeway rake through the salt flats.
      lincoln is driving more confidently now. ester is huddled asleep
      beside him. suddenly the skiff starts to slow again. lincoln
      reviews the controls. throttle, forward, foot, off the brake.
      the interface flashes: "remote lockdown e n g a g i n g " . the skiff is
      steering itself onto the hard shoulder. it now pulls to a dead
      halt. ester is woken by the sudden inertia. she opens her eyes
      and looks around. they've stopped in the middle of nowhere.
