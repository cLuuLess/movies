    frosted glass workstations, notably circular rather than square.
    lincoln sits at his desk in front of a wraparound etherscreen,
    divided into three sections, a formation known as a "visor".
    right-visor shows a polymorph in fractal cycle, like a permanent
    screen saver. mid-visor shows a tomograph of a residential block;
    tiers of apartments shown as boxes, most in solid white, a few
    blink red with the text label "vacancy". left-visor shows a list
    of names and sociographic grading sheaded "residents pending".

    left-visor, the name highlights then blinks out. mid-visor, a
    box labelled "vacancy" turns from blinking red to solid white.

                                 a voice (o.s.)
                     hey, you want to know something?

    lincoln looks up at a face grinning over the partition - mid
    30's, jovial, tall and burly. his name is jones three-bravo.

                                jones
                     you know that guy who won the spin in
                     your sector? starkweather?

                     how long he's been here? six months.

                     spin's rigged for the long haulers?

                   shut up, jonesy.

                              jones
                   why don't you make me? in the ring.

                                 lincoln
                   you're out of my weight-class.

                              jones
                   not anymore. they just got the new
                   program in - multi-weight balancing.

                               lincoln
                   i'll think about it.

                                 jones
                   c'mon, champ. a stim unit says you
                   won't last three rounds.
