     lincoln stares out of the window. the red pulse of the lode poles
     catches a glazed look in his eyes. his pupils, a little dilated.
     his focus returns to the interior and an etherscreen banner:

     - - g e t ready for the daily spin!... tomorrow it could be you...

                                                                             11.
