203   int . ceo's office - the sanger industries tower - day

      a celestial penthouse office. katherine enters with crowne.
      merrick and dr. sanger rise to greet her. strained solemnity.

                              dr. sanger
                    m y name is henry sanger. i'd like to
                    offer my deepest condolences.

      his insincerity is transparent. katherine just nods stiffly.

                                dr. sanger
                    this is bernard merrick our facility
                    director. he knew ester personally.

                               merrick
                    an d it's a terrible loss.

      m o r e insincerity. katherine nods again. then settles in a chair.
      crowne allows a respectful pause. then begins with due delicacy-

                                    crowne
                    l e g a l issues must seem trivial at this
                    time. but the sponsorship agreement has
                    certain conditions relating to confident-
                    i a l i t y . d e s p i t e this tragic t u r n of
                    events, those conditions remain binding.
                    we want to be sure you understand that.

                               katherine
                    i see.

                                crowne
                    t h a t said, the institute is likewise
                    bound by the terms of sponsorship and
                    while we reserve every right...

                               katherine
                    you can stop there. i know why i'm
                    here. you wanted to know if i'm going
                    to sue you for breach of contract.

                                                             130.



                             dr. sanger
              n o t h i n g so devious, mrs. ester. we
              simply wanted to find some way to
              heal the wounds from this incident.

                       katherine
              i don't want restitution, dr. sanger.
              the reason i agreed to this meeting
              was to have the chance to talk to you.

                        dr. sanger
              o f course. please...

                         katherine
              i never got to meet you when i visited
              the institute. it was one of your sales-
              m e n who led the tour. i remember how
              h e described the agnates a s if they
              were some kind of mindless organisms.
              more like livestock than humanity...

                              crowne
              l e g a l l y , human rights don't apply.

                           dr. sanger
              don't interrupt, ellen.

                       katherine
              i remember how eager i was to believe
              him. but when i saw w h a t i'd created,
              in flesh and blood, when i touched h e r ,
              it was i who felt less than human.

                       dr. sanger
              i understand.

he looks at her expressively. perhaps he really does understand.

                               katherine
              ester ' s life was my responsibility and
              her death is my cross to bear alone. so
              i'm not going to sue you, dr. sanger...
                     ( b e a t , a sudden ominous tone)
              but i am going to blame y o u . until the
              day i die, i will silently curse your
              name. that's w h a t i wanted you to know.

she drives it home with a horrible look. sanger accepts it with
due gravity. there's an ugly pause. katherine gets to her feet.

                         katherine
              an d now i'd like to leave, please.

                                                                          131.



                               crowne
                     we do have other issues to discuss...

                                dr. sanger
                     n o , ellen, that's enough. i think mrs.
                     ester has said all there is to say.
