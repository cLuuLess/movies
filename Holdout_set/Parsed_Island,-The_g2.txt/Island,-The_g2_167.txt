169   ext . the north ridge - morning

      the north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the
      grey cutter pulling up. diggs and burdon get out and look down
      into the canyon. diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning.
      burdon peels off his jacket. it's early but it's already getting
      hot. diggs now pauses, handing him the scope for his opinion-

                                diggs
                      up there in the rocks. three o'clock.
                      i'm not sure... it could be ambient.
