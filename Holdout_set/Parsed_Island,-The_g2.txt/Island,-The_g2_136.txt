138   int . cutter - driving - night

      diggs climbs in an burdon steers out into traffic. the thrill
      o f the chase is gone from them now. both seem equally grim and
      determined. diggs taps the holocom. a holoframe resolves, snows
      with static. then janeen's face appears, dishevelled, bitter-

                                 janeen (on holocom)
                     what the fuck do you want now?

                                     diggs
                            (very calm, very cold)
                     punch into the currency stream, close
                     the net on downtown and keep the search
                     active. the next time they use the card,
                     i want to be right on top of them...

      o f f his icy tone, janeen nods without retort. diggs hits a key
      and her face blinks out. and the cutter prowls into the night.
