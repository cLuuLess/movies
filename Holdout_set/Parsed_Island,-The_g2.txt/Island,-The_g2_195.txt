197   ext . streets of phoenix - night

      t h e corsair ploughs up the street - traffic swerving out of its
      path - buoys clanging as it lurches from one lane to the next -

      lincoln jams the throttle - the resistors buzzing, growling with
      energy - he has one goal - draw his enemy away from ester -

      s c h e e r coolly intent at the controls of the straker - keeping a
      certain distance - waiting for his quarry to make a mistake --

      a metro pd officer pulls out - mounted on a hybrid of motorbike
      and jetski k n o w n as a "lode-runner" - sounding the siren--

      s c h e e r reacting - the pd lode-runner pulling ahead of him - he
      can't allow a police intervention - he slips in behind --

                                                                             126.



      the metro pd officer - darting looks back - headlamps b l i n d i n g
      his rear-view - another vehicle is coming up behind him fast -
      - c l a n g - the straker i m p a c t s - glancing the pd lode-runner which
      wobbles, corrects - the straker d r o p s back for a longer run up--

      t h e metro pd officer - yelling into his headset - inaudible over
      the siren - the headlamps a g a i n - the vehicle coming up behind--
      - c r a s h - the pd lode-runner fishtails - its resistors suddenly
      clash with the prevailing polarity - a huge jolt of inertia-

      c a t a p u l t i n g the metro pd officer through the air - plummeting
      down into obscurity - the straker w h o o s h i n g over his head -
      t h e pd lode-runner left spinning behind - resistors vying with
      the polarity - the drive system melting down - fusing, sparking--

      - b o o m - the pd lode-runner explodes in a flash of electrical fire-

      s c h e e r watches the fireball in his rear-view - there will be more
      police soon - he jams the throttle - he has to end this.

      lincoln seeing the straker z o o m i n g up behind - veering round
      another corner - the chassis tilting - a steep banking turn -

      t h e corsair hull runners thudding across the buffers - recoil
      sending the chassis up against the concrete - sparks flying--

      s c h e e r turning the corner - the windshield suddenly sprayed with
      sparks - jerking back on the throttle to avoid a collision -

      lincoln fighting to correct the steering - seeing the straker
      d r o p p i n g back - a chance to gain distance - jamming the throttle-

      a n intersection approaching - lincoln can't correct his steering
      in time - the corsair careens at full res over the intersection--

      c r a s h i n g through a gate arm - the ground dropping away into a
      steep ramp - suddenly the corsair is flying through the air--

      c r a s h i n g - squealing onwards - scudding across vehicle roofs,
      finally nose-diving into an empty bay with a deafening crunch-
