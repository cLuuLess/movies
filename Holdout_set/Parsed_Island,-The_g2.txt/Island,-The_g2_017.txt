19   ext . the world outside - day
     a i r blasts up from a giant tunnel.

     w i d e n i n g , we see it is one of a huge ring, planted in the dust,
     backdropped b y mountainous red rocks. at the hub of the ring is
     a large cubic building. from its facets, giant appendages of
     ducting plunge into its surround. these are the inlets for the
     processed air that feeds the underground...

     this is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above.

     f r o m the processing plant, we pull back and up, raking over a
     large industrial complex. more cubic buildings, cream colored,
     windowless, like stacks of giant playing bricks. now we see the
     front of the complex. the planate f a c a d e , faceless but for the
     entrance, cubed in polarized glass, like a dark cyclopean eye.

     f r o m the entrance, we follow a walkway out to a dock where the
     ground drops away into a broad concrete trench; like the subway,
     lined with lode-poles and buffers, it is known as a "lodeway".
     from the dock, we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall; red
     rock slabs, twenty feet high, framing a giant gateway. the gates
     now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall-

     the shimmering bleached wilderness of the arizona desert.
     o u t in the distance, where the lodeway tapers into the scrub, a
     vehicle emerges from the shimmer. a hybrid of bus and nautical
     craft, single hulled, known simply as a "liner". now as the
     liner becomes clearer, a decal on its prow is revealed - a
     crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d "the sanger institute".
