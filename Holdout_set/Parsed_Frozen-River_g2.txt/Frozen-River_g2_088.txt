     lila runs ahead. ray struggles to keep lila in sight.

     ray comes up behind lila, rifling through the unzipped
     duffel bag. she suddenly jumps back at the sight of the
     tiny face of an infant, wrapped in blankets, eyes closed,
     lips blue.

                              lila
               it's dead.

     ray looks at the baby. instinctively, she swoops down and
     gathers it up.

     ray heads for the car.

                              ray
               come on!

     lila follows her.
