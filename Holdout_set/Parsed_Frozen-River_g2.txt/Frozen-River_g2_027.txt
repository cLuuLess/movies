26   int. acclaim jimmy's garage lot - day                       26

     lila hands the paper bag to ray and points the gun at
     her, keeping it low and out of sight.

                             lila
               count it.

                            ray
               what's going on here?

                            lila
               just count it.

     ray opens the bag. it's full of cash. all fifties and
     hundreds. ray counts it.

                            lila (cont'd)
               how much is there?

                                                         24.


                       ray
          twelve hundred.

lila opens the glove compartment and presses the trunk
release.

jimmy motions to the chinese men to get in the trunk.
jimmy shuts it.

he taps twice on the hood of the car and walks back to
the garage.

                       lila
                 (to ray)
          let's go.

                       ray
          wait, who the fuck are they?

                       lila
          just back up.

                       ray
          i'm not moving until those people get out
          of my trunk.

                       lila
          i'll give you half. now let's go.

jimmy turns around, sees the two women arguing and gets
suspicious.

                       lila (cont'd)
          let's go!

                       ray
          i'm not taking them over the border.
          that's a crime.

                       lila
          there's no border here. this is free
          trade between nations.

                       ray
          this isn't a nation.

lila jams the gun into ray's side.

                       lila
                 (under her breath)
          let's go.

jimmy starts back toward the car. ray puts the car in
reverse and backs up.

                                                              25.
