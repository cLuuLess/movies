82   ext. ray's trailer - same                                   82

     a beat up car is there. inside a teenager, mitch, a few
     years older than t.j., hands him out a hot wheels tech
     track air stunt challenge set.

                            mitch
               that's what you wanted, right?

                            t.j.
               close enough.

     t.j. gives mitch a piece of paper with a list of names
     and credit card numbers including that of irene
     threerivers.

                            mitch
               thanks man, have a merry one.

     t.j turns to go back inside. he sees smoke rising through
     the cracks in the siding and goes to the back.

     black smoke pours from under the trailer where old
     insulation is smoldering. t.j. runs to the shed, takes a
     fire extinguisher and sprays under the trailer. steam
     rises. the fire appears to be out.
