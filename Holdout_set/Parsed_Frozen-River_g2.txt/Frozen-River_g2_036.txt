35   ext. ray's trailer yard - day                              35

     ray drives up in the acclaim.

     t.j., wearing protective goggles, works on the broken
     duck kiddie ride with a blow torch. he doesn't notice
     ray.

     ray covers over the cut with her hair and gets out and
     walks up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. he
     jumps and cuts the flame.

                            ray
               i told you not to use that thing when i'm
               not here.

                            t.j.
               if i get it working i can sell it.

     she looks at the rusted pieces of it.

                            ray
               i don't care. don't use that thing when
               i'm not here!

                                                      29.


                       t.j.
          rentaworld called. they're coming to get
          the tv if you don't pay by four tomorrow.

he notices the car.

                        t.j. (cont'd)
          did you find him?

                      ray
          no.

                       t.j.
          where was the car?

                       ray
          at the bus stop on the rez.

                       t.j.
          i bet he went to atlantic city.

                       ray
          you don't know that.

                       t.j.
          yeah, but you could figure it out. just
          find out what buses came through last-

                       ray
          and then what? chase him across the
          country. miss work. no.

                       t.j.
          what happened to your face?

                      ray
          nothin'.

                       t.j.
          what, did you get in a fight with
          somebody?

                       ray
          it was no big deal.

                       t.j.
          you got in a fight, for real?

                       ray
          some indian chick tried to steal your
          dad's car.

                                                            30.


                            t.j.
               no way. i say we go back there and kick
               some mohawk ass.

                            ray
               it doesn't matter.

                            t.j.
               where's your car?

                             ray
               i'll get it tomorrow.

                            t.j.
               you left it on the rez? that's so stupid.

                            ray
               i didn't have a tow rope.

                            t.j.
               i still say we go back there and kick
               some mohawk ass.

                            ray
               forget it t.j. did you and ricky eat?

                            t.j.
               that would be kinda miraculous since
               there's no food in the house.

                            ray
               there's food.

                            t.j.
               popcorn and tang.

     ray goes towards the trailer.
