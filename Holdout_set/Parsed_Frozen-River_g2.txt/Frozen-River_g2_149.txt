      the phone rings. t.j. picks it up.

                             t.j. (o.s.)
                hello. hi, mom.

      she hears his voice and can't speak.

                             t.j. (cont'd)
                -mom are you there? what's wrong?
                -what kinda trouble?
                -what did you do?
                -a smuggler!? holy shit!
                -are you in jail?
                -but are you're going to jail!?

      there is a long silence. he wipes a tear away with his
      sleeve.

      ricky plays with his hot wheels on the floor.

                             t.j. (cont'd)
                -yeah, okay. what does that mean? but
                why? i can take care of him, i do it all
                the time. but i don't see why we need-?
                             (more)

                                                              105.

                             t.j. (cont'd)
                -who? (pause) a baby? no way.
                -yeah i know where the stuff is. it's in
                the shed, but that's so stupid!.


      a knock at the door. t.j. looks at it, unsure what to do.

                             t.j. (cont'd)
                       (holding phone)
                -yeah, i'm here. somebody's at the door.

      he walks to it and opens it holding the phone. lila is
      standing there holding little jake, wrapped in her jean
      jacket.

      t.j. and lila look at each other.   she walks in.

                              t.j. (cont'd)
                -okay. bye.

      he hangs up.

      little jake sees ricky playing with the hot wheels set
      and reaches to get down.

      lila puts him on the floor. he crawls toward the
      christmas tree and the hot wheels set.

                             t.j. (cont'd)
                       (to ricky )
                you're gonna have to get the little
                pieces up high -- or he'll eat them.
