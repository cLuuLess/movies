19   ext. lila's camper - day                                   19

     ray gets in the horizon and pulls it in behind the
     acclaim then digs in the trunk, pulling out a rope.

     she ties one end to the acclaim's back fender and the
     other to the horizon's front fender.

     lila watches out the camper window.

     ray gets in the acclaim and starts it up slowly towing
     the horizon a few feet before the rope snaps.

     ray gets out and looks at the broken rope. she begins
     digging in the trunk for more rope.

     lila opens the camper door and looks at the bullet hole.

                               lila
                  this camper belongs to my brother in law.
                  he won't like this.

                               ray
                         (over her shoulder)
                  then you should quit stealing cars.

                               lila
                  i thought it was abandoned, the guy
                  driving it got on a bus.

     ray stops.

                               ray
                  did you see where the bus was headed?

                                                         18.


                       lila
          new york or buffalo, i'm not sure.

ray re-ties the tow line with the remaining rope.

this time the horizon goes an inch or two before the rope
snaps. ray gets out.

                         ray
                   (under her breath)
          shit!

ray rifles through the trunk for more rope.

"home on the range" plays on the cell phone in ray's back
pocket.


lila touches the bullet hole in the camper and listens to
ray's conversation from the doorway.

ray puts the phone back in her pocket and takes an old
belt of her husbands and tries to attach the fenders of
the cars.

ray gets back in the acclaim and tries towing the horizon
once again.

this time the right side of the front fender snaps off
and droops to one side.

ray gets out and looks at lila.

                       ray (cont'd)
          i'm not leaving this here.

                       lila
                 (points at the acclaim)
          i got a friend who might buy that.

                       ray
          it's not for sale.

                       lila
          he'll pay more than it's worth.

ray ignores her.

                       lila (cont'd)
          maybe two thousand.

                         ray
          why's that?

                                                           19.


                            lila
               he's always looking for cars with button-
               release trunks.

     ray thinks about it.

                            lila (cont'd)
               he don't need papers or anything.

                            ray
               does he use them to rob banks or
               something?

     lila shrugs.

                            lila
               all i know is he pays good for a car like
               this.

                            ray
               where does he live?

                            lila
               through the woods. not far.

                            ray
               what's in it for you?

                            lila
               he'll give me something for finding it.

                             ray
               if you try anything, i'm not afraid to
               use this.

                            lila
               yeah.
