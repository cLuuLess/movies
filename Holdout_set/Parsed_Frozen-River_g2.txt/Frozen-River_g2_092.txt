     ray notices the cruiser following her.

                            ray
               shit!

     lila looks back.

                            lila
               calm down.

     lila quickly pulls the baby near and wraps him inside her
     coat hiding him from sight.

     the dome lights start flashing.

                                                             67.


                            ray
               oh shit. what do i do?

                            lila
               calm down. just pull over.

                            ray
               what if he saw us go by before. to bob's.

                            lila
               he's got no reason to stop us, unless you
               give him one, so keep your mouth shut.

                            ray
               what if he searches the car. what do we
               say about-

                            lila
               he won't, just remember you're white.

     ray pushes the blankets onto the floor and kicks them
     under the seat.
