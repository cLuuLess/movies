97   int./ext. acclaim at bob's motel - night                    97

     ray and lila pull in to the motel but there is no sign of
     life.

     ray gathers up the blankets. lila sits motionless.

                            ray
               we gotta take it in.

     lila sits absolutely still.

                                                              70.


                               ray (cont'd)
               what is it?

                               lila
               it's moving.

                            ray
               what? are you sure?

     lila slowly takes the baby from inside her jacket.   his
     eyes open. he blinks. ray and lila stare at him.

                            lila
               hello little baby.

     the baby looks back at them.

                            ray
               he was just cold.

     ray and lila wrap him up in the blankets and get out with
     lila carrying the bundle and walk into the motel office.
