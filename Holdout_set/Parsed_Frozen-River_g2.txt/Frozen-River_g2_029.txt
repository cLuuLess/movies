28   int. acclaim on frozen river - day                         28

     ray drives. lila sits angled toward ray with the gun
     trained on her.

                            lila
               why'd your husband leave you?

                            ray
               fuck you.

                            lila
               maybe he wanted a younger women.

     ray stares out at the ice.

                            lila (cont'd)
               that's what usually happens.

     ray says nothing.

                            lila (cont'd)
               i never have to worry about that. my
               husband is dead. went down in the river
               on a run. they never found him. probably
               tangled in river weeds.

     she gives ray a spooky look.

                            lila (cont'd)
               you better slow down there are ruts out
               here. you could get stuck in one.

     ray speeds up and roars up the boat ramp off the ice
     skidding a little.
