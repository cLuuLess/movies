14   ext. reservation roads - day                                14

     ray follows the acclaim down route 37 and catches sight
     of it turning off on a dirt road.

     ray makes the corner just in time to catch sight of the
     acclaim bouncing off on a path through the woods.

     ray follows it through the woods to a clearing: the
     acclaim stops in front of a rusted out bubble camper.

     lila gets out. ray pulls up behind her and rolls down her
     window.

                            ray
               that's my car.

     lila spins around.

                            lila
               huh?

                            ray
                      (points to the acclaim)
               what are you doing with my car?

     lila fingers the keys in her hand.

                            lila
               that? i found it.

                            ray
               you stole it.

                             lila
               the keys were in it.

                            ray
               so you just took it...?

     lila goes in the bubble camper and shuts the door behind
     her.

     ray gets out of the horizon and walks up to the camper
     door and takes out her cell phone.

                            ray (cont'd)
               we'll just see what the troopers say
               about that.

                                                             16.


                            lila (o.s.)
                      (from inside camper)
               go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here.
               this is mohawk territory.

     ray stops dialing closes up her phone, then goes to her
     car and takes the gun and goes back to the camper.

                            ray
                      (knocks with the gun)
               you can cut the bullshit and give me my
               keys now.

     there is no reponse. ray waits for a moment and then:

                            ray (cont'd)
                      (low voice)
               troy, are you in there?

     there is no response.

                            ray (cont'd)
               if you're in there you better come out.
