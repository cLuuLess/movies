107   ext. trailer yard - day                                   107

      ray stands staring at t.j. at the trailer's burnt end.

                              t.j.
                what did he want? did something happen to
                dad?

                                ray
                no.

                             t.j.
                then what did he want?

      she points to the blackened siding on the trailer.

                             ray
                did you have a fire last night?

                             t.j.
                the pipes froze so i fixed `um.

                             ray
                you fixed um?

                                                      77.


                         t.j.
          yeah.

                       ray
          did you happen to use the blow torch?

she walks around back and looks underneath the trailer: a
mass of charred and melted insulation.

                       ray (cont'd)
          look at this. we can't live here anymore!

                       t.j.
          it's just a tin crapper.

                       ray
          no, it was our house.

                       t.j.
          so, we're gettin' a new one, right?

                       ray
          jesus, you could have killed yourself and
          your brother.

she grabs the blowtorch and slams it to the ground, but
it is indestructible.

                       t.j.
          it's not yours, he gave it to me.

she goes to the car, takes out her gun then puts the blow
torch on the ground and aims at it -- but t.j. grabs it.

                         ray
          put it down.

                         t.j.
          no!

                         ray
          put it down.

                       t.j.
          are you gonna shoot me now, too?

                       ray
          put that thing down!

he ignites the blow torch to spite her.

                       t.j.
          maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his
          own house. maybe that's why he left.

                                                         78.


                       ray
          that was an accident.

                       t.j.
          some accident you shot him in the foot.

                       ray
          he spent the food money on scratch cards,
          t.j.

                       t.j.
          so, he'd done it before.

he aims it at her. she walks towards him. he increases
the flame.

                       ray
          gimme that thing.

she tries to grab it out of his hand, but he is too
strong.

                       ray (cont'd)
          t.j. come on now.

                       t.j.
          you can't have it. it's mine.

his eyes fill with tears, but his face stays tight.

she grabs at it again, but he jerks it away. she pauses
and stares at him.

                       ray
          he was clean for 23 months.

they look at one another.

                       ray (cont'd)
                 (chokes back tears)
          i didn't know how else to keep us
          together. i mean...he's a good dad when
          he's not gamblin'.

he cuts off the blow torch.

                       t.j.
          yeah, awesome dad. robs us and takes off
          a week before christmas.

she walks up to him and wipes a tear from the side of his
face. he shakes it off.

                                                               79.


      they stand in the cold air for a long moment their breath
      visible. she touches his hair.

                               ray
                i know.


                                                           cut to:
