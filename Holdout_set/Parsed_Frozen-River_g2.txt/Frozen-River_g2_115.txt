114   int. office, versailles mobile home lot - night            114

      ray comes in on guy versailles giving a young couple the
      hard sell.

                             versailles
                ...what i think you'll find with the
                commodore -- and you'll be the judge --
                is that the vinyl wall covering is
                perfect for small children. there is
                never a need to repaint or even touch up-

                             ray
                i wanna schedule a delivery.

      versailles looks up, annoyed. he plasters on a smile.

                                                               83.


                              versailles
                        (to the couple)
                 give me just a second.

      he tries to take ray aside.

                              versailles (cont'd)
                 what do you want?

      she pulls a huge wad of cash from her jacket pocket.

                              versailles (cont'd)
                 is this all of it?

                              ray
                 it's three thousand but i want it
                 delivered tomorrow.

                              versailles
                 i told you all or nothing.

      she holds out the cash. the couple tries not to watch.

                              ray
                 take it as a deposit. all you have to do
                 is show up. if i don't have the rest you
                 keep it.

                              versailles
                 can't argue with that. you'll have to
                 sign something, though.

      he takes out a contract and writes in the deposit amount
      as thirteen hundred seventy two dollars owing.

      ray signs the paper.

                                                            cut to:
