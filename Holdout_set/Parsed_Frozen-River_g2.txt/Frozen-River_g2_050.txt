                are they always there?

                            lila
               yeah, but they can't stop you unless you
               give them a reason.

                            ray
               have you ever gotten caught?

                            lila
               once.

                            ray
               what happened?

                            lila
               they gave me the choice of paying a fine
               or spending three months in jail.

                            ray
               what did you do?

                            lila
               i paid the fine. i made the money back in
               two nights of smuggling. but back then it
               was cigarettes and everybody did it. some
               of the troopers were into it, too.

                            ray
               smuggling?

                            lila
               yeah. but when they lowered the tax on
               cigarettes in canada most people got out
               of it and the rest switched over to
               chinese.
