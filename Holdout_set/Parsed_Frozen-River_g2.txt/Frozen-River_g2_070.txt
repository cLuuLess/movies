     t.j. dumps the contents of a box containing the pieces of
     an artificial christmas tree. branches cover the floor.
     the boys begin putting it together like a puzzle.

     the tv is on. a commercial for the hot wheels tech track
     air stunt challenge set comes on.

     ricky trains in on it, flinching and jerking his body
     with sound effects at the sight of the flying hot wheels
     cars and the booming voice of the announcer.

                             ricky
                daddy is gettin' me that for christmas.
