22   int. acclaim at boat ramp - day                            22

     ray looks out at the ice. tire tracks make a path across
     the snow-covered surface between carefully set out cut
     evergreen trees.

                            lila
               not too fast. there's ruts.

                            ray
               i'm not crossing that!

                            lila
               don't worry they already put out the
               christmas trees. there's no black ice.

                            ray
               that's canada.

                            lila
               no, it's mohawk land. the rez is on both
               sides of the river.

                            ray
               what about the border patrol?

                                                              21.


                            lila
               there's no border.

                            ray
               i'm still not crossing that.

                            lila
               don't worry, it'll hold a plymouth. i've
               seen semis cross it.

     ray looks at lila suspiciously.

                            lila (cont'd)
               the only other way is the cornwall bridge
               and they won't let you take that. (points
               at the gun).

     suddenly, a truck driven by a mohawk teenager roars out
     of the woods and swerves around the acclaim fishtailing
     then speeding out across the ice.

                            lila (cont'd)
               they plow it and everything.

     cautiously, ray lets off the brake and rolls down the
     boat ramp towards the smooth surface of the river.

                            ray
                      (under her breath)
               this is so fuckin' stupid.

                            lila
               not too fast, there are ruts.
