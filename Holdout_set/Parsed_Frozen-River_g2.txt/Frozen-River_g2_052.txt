     ray takes the money.

                            lila
               count it.

                            ray
               right, i know.

                                                              43.


                            lila
               well, be sure it's right. i don't wanna
               get stiffed.

                            ray
               then why don't you count it?

                            lila
               i got bad eyes.


     she counts it and nods at lila. lila pops the trunk and
     the barefoot chinese men get out. ray and lila look at
     them, they look back, blank and ungrateful.

     ray rolls down the window and tosses out their shoes and
     socks.

                            ray
               you're welcome.

     ray swerves back out onto route 37.
