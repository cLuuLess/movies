     ray rings up a counter full of merchandise for a heavyset
     customer in her 20s.

                            ray
               that's $87.50.

                                                              53.


     the customer hands her a credit card.

     ray processes the credit card. it is declined.

                            ray (cont'd)
               sorry. didn't go through.

     the customer looks up with exaggerated annoyance.

                            ray (cont'd)
                      (in a low voice)
               i can try to put it though again.

     the customer grabs her purse from the basket, and walks
     out the door, leaving the merchandise.

                            customer
                      (yells back at ray)
               you got a problem with your machine,
               lady!

     ray moves the merchandise aside for the next customer.
     it is trooper napoli.

     ray is startled to see him. he puts down some shaving
     cream and a diet pepsi.

                            ray
                      (rings him up)
               that'll be three seventy six.

     he digs in his pocket.

                              trooper

     he counts it out. she hands him his bag and watches him
     walk out.
