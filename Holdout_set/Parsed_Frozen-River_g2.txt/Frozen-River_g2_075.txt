     lila struggles to count the money by the light of the
     glove compartment.

                             lila
                is that a two or a five?

                                                         59.


                       ray
                 (glances down)
          a five.

ray creeps along straining to see out the windshield. the
windshield fluid peters out.

                         ray (cont'd)
          shit!

lila looks up. outside is a wall of white.

                       lila
          you gotta stop so i can fill up the wiper
          fluid.

                       ray
          i'm not stoppin'.

                       lila
          it's a hundred feet deep out here if we
          get on black ice

ray sticks her head out the window but the snow and the
wind are too strong. she stops.

lila gets out with the wiper fluid. ray pops the hood.

ray looks in the backseat at the duffel bag. she
hesitates a moment then reaches into the back and opens
the back passenger door and slides the bag out of the
car.

lila gets back inside.

                       lila (cont'd)
          what are you doing?

                       ray
          nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't
          tell what they might have in there. i'm
          not gonna be responsible for that.

ray tries the windshield wipers. fluid clears the
windshield.

ray dials her cell phone with one hand.

                       ray (cont'd)
          -hi, i'm gonna be a little late.(pause)

                            ray (cont'd)
                      (to lila)
               you'd think a new house would be enough.

     ray guns it up the boat launch to the shore.
