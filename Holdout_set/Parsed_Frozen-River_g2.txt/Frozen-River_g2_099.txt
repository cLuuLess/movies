98   int. bob's motel - same                                     98

     ray and lila look around the shabby motel office circa
     1950s with a few threadbare chairs. no one is at the
     front desk.

     ray ventures behind the desk and knocks on a small door.
     she carefully opens it to a small office with a desk,
     cluttered with papers and, beyond it, another door. ray
     knocks and opens it to:

     a living room hung with heavy red pakistani fabrics and
     lights. the dealer and the pakistani man study a map of
     new york state spread out on the table.

     behind them the pakistani woman sits on the couch.

     ray comes in, followed by lila carrying the baby.

                            ray
               we found him.

     the pakistani woman looks up, sees the bundle and hurries
     across the room to lila. lila holds out the baby with a
     little smile and the pakistani woman snatches it out of
     her arms.

     the pakistani women pulls back the blanket and sees the
     baby -- alive. she sinks to her knees letting out a
     wail.

                                                               71.


      lila's eyes fill with tears. ray chokes back her own.

                             ray (cont'd)
                       (to lila)
                come on. let's go.

      lila follows ray out, looking over her shoulder at the
      baby.
