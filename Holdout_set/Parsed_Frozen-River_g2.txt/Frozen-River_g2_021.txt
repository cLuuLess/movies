20   int. acclaim in reservation woods - day                 20

     ray drives with one hand and holds the gun with the
     other. it is pointed at lila in the passenger seat.

                            lila
               turn up there.

                            ray
               where?

                            lila
               where that stump is.

                                                           20.


     ray makes the turn with one hand and the car bounces
     through an overgrown path in the woods. ray reaches the
     stump.

                             ray
                      (nervous)
               there's no road.

                            lila
               there's a path.

     ray hesitates.

                            lila (cont'd)
               it's not far.

     ray turns and drives into deeper woods. the gun jiggles
     around in ray's hand as they bounce along between the
     trees.

     lila tries to ignore it.
