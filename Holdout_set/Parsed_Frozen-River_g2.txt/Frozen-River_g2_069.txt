68   ext. frozen river - night                                   68

     ray and lila drive across the smooth river surface. snow
     falls steadily. the windshield wipers snap back and
     forth.

     they barely avoid the oncoming headlights of another
     smuggler's car crossing the ice.

                            ray
               don't you people even take christmas eve
               off?

                            lila
               mohawks don't celebrate christmas.

                            ray
               you could fool me the way they were all
               lined up at all for a dollar today.

                            lila

                            ray
               from what?

                            lila
               from the longhouse ways.
