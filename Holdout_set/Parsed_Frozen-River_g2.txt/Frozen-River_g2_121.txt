120   ext. parking lot, club super sexe - same                   120

      they wait.

                                bruno
                   d'at your car?

      he points to the acclaim parked a few feet away. they
      nod. he walks out to a shed and unlocks the door. two
      very young chinese girls, sickly and pale, wearing jean
      jackets look vacantly out.

      bruno signals them to get out.

                                bruno (cont'd)
                   open the trunk.

                                lila
                   we need to get paid, first.

                                 bruno
                   oh, yes.

      he pulls a wad of cash from inside his coat and hands it
      to lila. she counts it out.

                                lila
                   you only got six hundred here.

                                bruno
                   you get the rest at drop off.

                                lila
                   it's six hundred apiece.

      the girls stand shivering by the trunk.

                                                        87.


                       bruno
          that's the deal i make with jimmy, now
          you want to change?

lila and ray look at each other.

                       lila
          it's twelve hundred.

                       bruno
          you want to make a problem?

bruno glances at the bartender watching from the back
door of the club.

                       bruno (cont'd)
                 (annoyed by ray)
          ...because you're not making a problem
          for me. and you're making a problem for
          them. let me show you something.

he approaches the two girls.

he grabs one of the girls by the hair, kicks her in the
back of the knees forcing her to the ground.

lila looks at ray. the girl tries to get on her feet, but
each time she does he kicks her in the back of the knees
again.

                       lila
                 (to ray)
          let's just go.

held up by her hair, the girl slides around helplessly.
lila winces at the sight. ray stares at bruno.

                       ray
          okay. we'll take them.

lila looks at ray.

bruno drops the girl who scrambles to her feet.

                       lila
          let's go.

                       ray
          just open the trunk.

lila leans into the passenger side of the acclaim and
pops the trunk. bruno looks at ray:

                                                         88.


                       bruno
          you must be the brains of the operation.

he motions the girls into the trunk and shuts it after
them.

lila get in the passenger side and bruno starts for the
back door of the club.

ray pulls her gun out of her jacket and aims it at bruno.

                         ray
          turn around!

bruno stops and turns around.

                       ray (cont'd)
          i want the rest.

he opens his fur coat.

                        bruno
                 (cool)
          i don't have any more.

in the shiny coat lining only the handle of a long pistol
is visible.

                       ray
                 (to the bartender)
           go get it.

bruno looks around and nods at the bartender. the
bartender panics not knowing what to do and begins
speaking in french to bruno.

ray shoots at the pavement beside bruno.

                       bruno
                 (to the bartender)
          give it to her.

the bartender disappears into the club. ray waits with
the gun on bruno.

                       lila
                 (from inside the acclaim)
          let's get out of here. i'll give you the
          rest of the money.

                       ray
          no. but thanks.

                                                         89.


                       lila
          you're gonna get us all killed.

a moment later the bartender comes back, shaking and
holding cash.

                       ray
          put it there.

she indicates the trunk.

                       bruno
                 (to the bartender)
          you aren't so smart as you look.


ray grabs the money and still pointing at bruno, backs
into the car.

bruno reaches for his pistol and aims at them as the
acclaim squeals away.

bruno fires shattering the driver's side window, grazing
ray's head.

ray falls back, dazed for a moment. lila steers. then ray
takes the wheel as they swerve out onto the main road.

                         ray
          he shot me.

ray wipes the blood from her forehead.

                       lila
          you should'a just taken the money from
          me?

                       ray
                 (blood streams down her face)
          i'm tired of people stealing from me.    is
          it all there?

                       lila
          we gotta get outta here, first.

                       ray
          just count it and make sure it's all
          there!

ray hands her the wad of money. lila struggles to put on
her glasses and counts out the money.

                         ray (cont'd)
          is it there?

                                                              90.


                             lila
                it's all there.

                               ray
                good.

                             lila
                slow down a little. we gotta keep it
                under the speed limit.

      ray smiles and wipes away the blood.

      they drive a short distance. ray checks the rear-view
      mirror.

                             lila (cont'd)
                we gotta get off this road.

      lila looks in the rear view. headlights appear behing
      them.

      ray speeds up approaching an intersection: the sign reads
      "arret"

                               lila (cont'd)
                slow down!

                               ray
                i can't.

      lila looks back in the rear view mirror. the headlights
      are gaining on them.

      she speeds through it.

      a local surete de quebec police cruiser parked out of
      sight takes off after her, lights flashing.
