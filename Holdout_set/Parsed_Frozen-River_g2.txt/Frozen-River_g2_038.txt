               mommy, i was thinking. what's gonna
               happen to the tin crapper when we get our
               new house?

                            ray
                      (half asleep)
               they're gonna flatten it out and send it
               to china.

                            ricky
               then what?

                            ray
               they're gonna melt it down and make
               little toys out if it.

                            ricky
               then what?

                            ray
               they'll send them back here so i can sell
               them at all for a dollar.

                            ricky
               and you can buy me some?

                            ray
               that's right.

                            ricky
