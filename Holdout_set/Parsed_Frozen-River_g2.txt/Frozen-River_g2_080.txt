     lila and ray pull back onto route 37 and drive along in
     stunned silence.

                             ray
               it didn't feel like there was anything in
               that bag.

                            lila
               we gotta go back.

                             ray
               i can't believe they put their baby in a
               duffle bag.

                            lila
               i can't believe you left it out there.

                            ray
               if you'd let me search it i would never
               have taken it-

                            lila
               we gotta go back.

                            ray
               i know! i know that.

                                                              63.
