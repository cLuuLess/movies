45   int. acclaim on frozen river -   day                        45

     ray drives across the river. the socks and shoes are
     between them.

                            ray
               why would they want to run?

                            lila
               to get away from the snakeheads.

                                                           40.


                              ray
               what's that?

                            lila
               the snakeheads pay to get them here and
               then they gotta work off what they owe .

                            ray
               how much does it cost?

                            lila
               forty, fifty thousand. depends where
               they're coming from.

                              ray
               to get here?

                            lila
               sometimes they gotta work for years to
               pay it off.

                            ray
                      (disbelief)
               to get here? no fuckin' way.

     she gets a whiff of the socks.

                            ray (cont'd)
               god those are ripe.

     she throws them into the backseat.

                            lila
               they always stink.


     two more cars are seen coming toward them on the river.
     they swerve wide to avoid the acclaim.

     she speeds up to make it up the boat launch.
