105   ext. ray's trailer yard - day                             105

      ray slips on her boots, grabs her jacket around her and
      steps outside the trailer door.


                             trooper napoli
                this is about the woman who was with you.

                               ray
                yes.

                             trooper napoli
                how long have you known her?

                                                      75.


                       ray
          not too long. she looks after my kids.

                       trooper napoli
          she's a smuggler.

                        ray
          really?

                        trooper napoli
          yes.

                       ray
          wow. that's a shock.

                       trooper napoli
          yes, well, there is that element on the
          reservation i'm sure you know.

                       ray
          yeah, i've heard about it but i didn't
          know she was involved.

                       trooper napoli
          how did you happen to meet her?

                        ray
          uh, i think there was a sign for a baby
          sitter at the wolf mart. that's where i
          get my gas.

                       trooper napoli
          i just thought you should be aware of
          that. she's known to have smuggled
          illegal immigrants into the country.

                        ray
          oh my god.

he nods his head.

                       trooper napoli
          if i were you i'd find a new baby sitter.
          you don't want her around young kids.

                        ray
          absolutely.

he eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained
siding is visible.

                       trooper napoli
          well, you have an enjoyable holiday.

                                                               76.


                             ray
                thanks. you, too.

      ray stands and watches the trooper drive away. she feels
      in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and
      fumbles to light one, sucking on it, unaware of the cold.

      when she turns around she looks at the trailer and
      notices the smoke-stained siding on one end of it.
