18   ext. lila's camper - day                                   18

     keeping behind the door for cover, lila opens it. ray
     looks inside: there is no sign of troy.

                               lila
                         (from behind the door)
                  the tribal police don't like people
                  shooting holes in other people's houses.

     ray looks at her.

                               ray
                  this is new york state so quit the
                  bullshit and give me my damn keys!

     lila throws the keys out the door. ray picks them up off
     the ground. lila shuts the door with her foot.
