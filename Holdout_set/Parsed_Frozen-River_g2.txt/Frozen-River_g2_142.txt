      lila and bernie sit on the old sofa by the big oven.

                             lila
                he might be better off.

                             bernie
                jake wouldn't agree with that.

                             lila
                it was all for a new crib. i wanted the
                baby to have a pretty new crib, not some
                handmedown. and he wouldn't let me go
                alone. (laughs) i was too fat to get
                behind the steering wheel.

                             bernie
                he wanted to keep you and little jake
                safe.

      the back door opens. ray is there.

                             ray
                it's just a few months, right?

      bernie and lila turn around. ray walks in.

                             ray (cont'd)
                i got baby stuff in the shed.

                                                             101.


      she takes the folded double-wide contract out of her
      pocket and holds it out to lila.

                             ray (cont'd)
                get a good used single wide with
                insulation. insulation is the key thing.
                versailles will give you a hard time, but
                that will leave enough for you and the
                boys to live on for a couple of months.
                ricky's allergic to penicillin.(a moment)
                and you can't feed `em pringles all the
                time. okay?

      lila isn't sure.

                             ray (cont'd)
                okay?

      lila nods her head.

                             ray (cont'd)
                but you gotta get there quick, before the
                police, `cause t.j. will get scared. i
                don't want him to get scared, you know.

      ray chokes back her own tears.

                             lila
                okay.

      lila takes the contract from ray.

                             ray
                and don't let him jerk you around.
                versailles, i mean. (to bernie) go with
                her. okay?

      bernie nods.

                             bernie
                sure.
