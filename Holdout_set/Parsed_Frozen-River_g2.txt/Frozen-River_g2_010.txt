9   ext. wolf mart gas station - day                               9

    ray pulls in to the combo gas station, restaurant and
    mini mart.

                                                      12.


a mohawk teenager wearing a bandana runs out to the car
without a coat, rubbing his hands together to ward off
the cold.

                        mohawk teenager
          fill it up?

she rolls down the window, digging for change under the
seat of her car. she counts it out.

                       ray
          just three...uh, no...two seventy one,
          two, three, four.

                       mohawk teenager
          two seventy four.

he nods and goes to the pump. she finds a wadded up five
dollar bill.

                       ray
                 (yells out window)
          make that seven seventy four.

she spots a sign for "trailways" bus in the window.

                       ray (cont'd)
          did you see a blue acclaim come in here
          last night?

                       mohawk teenager
          blue acclaim...no, but i only worked
          until 9 pm. you can ask inside.

ray glances inside at the mostly empty restaurant but for
a few older mohawk women.

                       ray
          no, that's okay.

                       mohawk teenager
          did you want to support our mosquito
          lacrosse league. it teaches basic
          lacrosse skills to the kids three to
          five.

ray shakes her head.

                       mohawk teenager (cont'd)
          thanks, anyway. have a good day.

                                                              13.
