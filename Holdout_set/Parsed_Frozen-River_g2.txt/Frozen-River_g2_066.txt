65   int. mohawk tribal council, reception area - day           65

     mohawk paintings and a huge wolf carved out of wood
     decorate the waiting area.

     nearby is an office marked "grand chief"

     a mohawk woman walks by the desk and recognizes lila,
     then looks away, quickly.

     a tall, middle-aged woman, grand chief rosalie comes out
     of the office and walks up to lila.

                                                              54.


                            rosalie
               do i have any messages?

     lila hands her a stack. she takes them and walks away,
     then stops.

                            rosalie (cont'd)
               i can't read this.

     she holds the message out to lila. lila tries to read it,
     squinting.

                             lila
               i think it's a "t.".

                            rosalie
               no, i can't read any of it.

                            lila
               i told bernie i couldn't see.

     lila grabs her jean jacket.

                            lila (cont'd)
               nevermind. i'll go.

     she walks out.
