3   ext. ray's trailer yard, massena new york - day             3

    ray eddy, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red
    ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger
    seat of her red plymouth horizon with the door open,
    smoking a cigarette, thinking. her breath is visible in
    the cold morning air.

    her bare feet rest on the cold ground.

    her 1970's rusted out trailer home sits in front of her
    on cinder blocks at a slight tilt. beside it, a small
    shed and behind it the concrete foundation for a house.

    around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski
    lift chair, the front end of a plymouth duster and a
    smiling duck kiddie ride.

    beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land.

    after a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, troy, jr.,
    leans out the trailer door.

                            t.j.
               we're out of capt'n crunch.

    his breath is visible in the cold.

                             ray
               just give him toast.

                                                         2.


                       t.j.
          we got no butter, we got no jelly.

ray is out of ideas. he expects her to move, but she
stays still. he looks around the yard.

                       t.j. (cont'd)
          what are you doing?

                       ray
          listening for the trucks.

                       t.j.
          are they really coming?

                         ray
          yeah.

                         t.j.
          where's dad?

she is silent.

                       t.j. (cont'd)
                 (says it slow)
          where's dad?

she looks at him.

                       ray
          i don't know how he found it, t.j.

                         t.j.
          found what?

ray takes a drag off her cigarette. t.j. walks over to
the car.

                         t.j. (cont'd)
          the money?

                       ray
          i locked it in my glove compartment.

t.j. looks in at the open and empty glove compartment.

                       t.j.
          that was stupid.

                       ray
          yeah, i see that now, but the trucks were
          coming before the bank opened.

                                                      3.


                       t.j.
          did you tell him you had it?

                       ray
          duh? no, i guess he just sniffed it out.

                       t.j.
          jesus christ! the glove compartment!?
          that's the stupidest place you could have
          put it.

                       ray
          he hasn't bought a scratch card in almost
          thirty two months. i thought it would be
          okay!

                       t.j.
          did he leave anything?

she shakes her head.

                       t.j. (cont'd)
          what are you gonna do?

                       ray
          nothing.

                       t.j.
          you could look for him?

                       ray
          he could be anywhere.

                       t.j.
          we should look for him.

                       ray
          where?

                       t.j.
          the rez,

                       ray
          with more than four thousand dollars,
          he's probably in atlantic city by now.

                       t.j.
          so let's go, let's find him before he
          blows it all.



                       (cont'd)

                                                             4.


                           ray
              i can't.

                           t.j.
              what do you mean?

                           ray
              i just can't do it anymore.

                           t.j.
              but he'll lose it all.

                           ray
              t.j., we can't make him stop.

                           t.j.
              he stole our money. call the troopers.

                           ray
              it's not stealing if you take it from
              your family. anyway, he made some of it,
              too.

                           t.j.
              so you're just gonna sit there?

                           ray
              i'm sorry.

    in the distance the rumble of trucks. ray hears it. it
    gets louder.

                           t.j.
              another christmas in the tin crapper.

    t.j. goes into the shed and slams the door.

    ray throws down her cigarette and goes into the trailer.
