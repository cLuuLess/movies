      ray and lila drive down a quebec highway. the road signs
      are in french.

      the skyline of montreal is an orange glow in the far
      distance.

                             ray
                have you ever been there?

                             lila
                a few times. have you?

                no, troy didn't like to travel. he liked
                to work in his shed, mostly.

                                                               85.


      ray and lila drive down a commercial strip of shopping
      centers, fast food joints and strip clubs, with french
      names.

                             lila
                up there. that's it.

                             ray
