42   ext. jimmy's garage - day                                   42

     ray and lila drive up in the acclaim. thunder springs out
     again, caught by his chain just short of the car. ray
     flinches but keeps hold of the gun.

     jimmy walks out to meet them. lila rolls down her window.

                             jimmy
               bernie was askin' if i'd seen you. i told
               him no.

                             lila
               thanks.

                            jimmy
               i don't want any trouble with him, lila.

                            lila
               don't worry about it.

     jimmy's cell phone rings.

                            jimmy
               this guy's been calling all morning. he's
               got two up at the old casino.

                             lila
               okay.

     jimmy takes the call.
