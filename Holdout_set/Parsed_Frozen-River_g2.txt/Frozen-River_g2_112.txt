111   ext. mohawk bingo palace, parking lot -    day             111

      ray slumps down in the driver's seat of the acclaim
      waiting for lila to come out. she is parked a few cars
      away from the horizon.

      other bingo players come out and get in cars surrounding
      ray.

      mohawks employees, including lila come out of the
      "employees entrance". she starts toward horizon. she
      wears new glasses.

      catching sight of ray in the acclaim, she abruptly turns
      and starts walking in the opposite direction.

      ray pulls out and drives over following her in the
      acclaim.

                             lila
                i quit smuggling.

                             ray
                       (rolls down the window)
                t.j. set the trailer on fire.

      lila keeps walking. ray drives along beside her.

                             ray (cont'd)
                he didn't mean to, but the pipes froze
                and he got that damn torch out -- which i
                told him not to do touch when i wasn't
                there -- and he tried to thaw them out-

                             lila
                i got glasses and now i can see up close.

                             ray
                there's a hole in my bedroom floor. we
                gotta move.

lila keeps walking.

                       lila
          i don't want it.

                       ray
          what is it then?!

lila keeps walking.

                         ray (cont'd)
          are you still mad about that baby? `cause
          it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. i mean
          who puts their kid in a duffle bag?

lila keeps walking. ray follows trying to figure her out.

                       ray (cont'd)
          you're gonna need a lot of money to take
          care of a one year old baby.

                       lila
          i got enough.

                       ray
          yeah, but you gotta get him first.

lila stops dead in her tracks and looks at ray.

                       ray (cont'd)
          i'll help you. you can even borrow my
          gun.


lila looks around to see if anyone is watching and gets
in the acclaim with ray.

angle from bingo palace entrance: the ticket taker
watches the acclaim drive away.
