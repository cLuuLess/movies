     the pakistani woman crawls into the trunk and the man
     picks up the duffle bag to put it in but ray takes hold
     of it.

                             ray
                i'll take that.

     ray motions him into the trunk and shuts it. then she
     opens the bag and starts to rifle through it but lila
     stops her.

                              lila
                what are you doing?! just count the money
                and let's go.

     ray looks down at the bag. nothing is visible but
     clothes.

                             lila
                if we keeps snowing like this we won't be
                able to get across the river.

                             ray
                i just hope these aren't the ones that
                blow up themselves and everybody with
                them.

     ray zips the bag up and lila helps her slide it in the
     backseat.
