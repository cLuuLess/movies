      using the blow torch, t.j. works on the smiling duck
      kiddie ride.

                                                              106.


      ricky plays with little jake, dressed in a snow suit.
      lila comes outside with a plate of peanut butter
      sandwiches, badly made.

      t.j. signals ricky who brings little jake over and puts
      him on the kiddie ride. ricky holds him on the seat and
      t.j. flips a switch. the ride jerks a few times then
      starts to move back and fourth. little jake smiles.

      behind t.j. a mohawk tribal police cruiser drives up.

      billy two rivers gets out and walks up to t.j.

      he speaks sternly to t.j., pointing at the cruiser where
      an elderly and frail mohawk women in her eighties, mrs.
      threerivers, looks out the window.

      t.j. walks over to the cruiser. she rolls down the
      window. he says something to her, looking at the ground
      as he speaks.

      ricky and lila holding little jake look on.

      billy two rivers drives away.

      suddenly t.j. and ricky look up. a rumble is heard in the
      distance. from down the road the semi is seen
      approaching...

      t.j. smiles and ricky watches not sure whether to believe
      it or not. he takes t.j.'s hand.

                                                           cut to:
