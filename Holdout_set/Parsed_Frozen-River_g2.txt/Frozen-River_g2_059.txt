     ray walks through the kitchen now full of groceries and
     opens a can of adirondack cola. the remains of two
     hungry man dinners sit on the table.

     she sits down in the living room. t.j. watches the local
     weather.

                                                      47.

          expect a clipper from northern ontario to
          bring 8 to 12 inches of snow and winds

          feel like minus 30. area farmers are
          advised to bring in livestock. more on
