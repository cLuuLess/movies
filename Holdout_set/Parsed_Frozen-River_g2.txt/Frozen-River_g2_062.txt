61   int. lila's camper -   day                                  61

     lila is sound asleep on her cot under three blankets next
     to the propane heater.

     bernie's snow balls thump against the side of the camper.

                            bernie (o.s.)
               lila! get up.

     lila opens her eyes and looks out the window, squinting
     at the snow glare.

                            bernie (cont'd)
               they got two people out sick today, so if
               you get down there you got the job.

                             lila
               huh?

                               bernie

     he holds up a paper cup.

     she slips on her jeans with a sweatshirt...
