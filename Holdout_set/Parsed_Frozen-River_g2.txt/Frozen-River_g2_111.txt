110   ext. mohawk bingo palace entrance - night                  110

      the short chubby toothless mohawk ticket taker perched on
      a metal stool beside a velvet rope.

      ray sees her and begins to dig in her jeans for a five.
      the ticket taker looks her up and down, expressionless.

      ray hands over the money. the ticket taker just looks at
      her.

                             ticket taker
                the game's over. they're verifying the
                last winner.

                             ray
                that's okay. i still wanna buy a ticket.

                             ticket taker
                i can't sell you one.

                               ray

                                                               80.

                             ticket taker
