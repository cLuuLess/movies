     in ray's rear view mirror, trooper napoli gets out of the
     cruiser. he puts on his hat and walks toward the car.

     ray rolls down her window.

                             trooper napoli
               license and registration?

     ray hands them over. he examines them, then leans down to
     the window.

                            trooper napoli (cont'd)
               could you step out of the vehicle, ma'am.

                            ray
                      (fakely nice)
               i wasn't speeding, was i?

                            trooper napoli
               just step out of the car.

                                                           68.


                            ray
               did i do something?

                            trooper napoli
                      (suspicious)
               ma'am i'm just directing you to step out
               of the vehicle?

                              ray
               okay.

     she gets out of the car reluctantly. he looks in at lila,
     she keeps her head down.

                            trooper napoli
               step around to the back of the vehicle.

     he follows ray to the back of the acclaim.
