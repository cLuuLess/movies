    ray helps ricky into his clothes and puts his backpack on
    his back.

                           ricky
              where's daddy?

    ray and t.j. look at each other.

                           ray
              he'll be back.

                           t.j.
              aren't we even gonna look for him?

                           ray
              no! i'm going to work and you're going to
              school.

                            t.j.
              that's it?

                                                       9.


                       ray
          the only thing that changed is that your
          dad started gambling again. everything
          else is the same.

                       ricky
          where did he go?

                       ray
          he had to take a business trip.

t.j. rolls his eyes.

                       t.j.
          aren't you even gonna look for him?

                       ray
          and miss a day of work? no. not again.
          we just have to live our lives. now go
          get your backpack.

t.j. stares, sullen.

                       ray (cont'd)
          go on!

                       ricky
          when is daddy coming home?

                       ray
          i don't know, ricky.

                       t.j.
          i can't believe you're not even gonna
          look for him.

                       ray
          where? where do i look? (he can't answer)

                       t.j.
          the reservation.

                       ray
          i told you, he could be in atlantic city
          by now.

she helps ricky get his backpack on and gives him a kiss.

                       t.j.
                 (shakes his head)
          the glove compartment. that's so stupid.

                       ray
          you're going to school.

                                                             10.


    he follows ricky out the door to catch the school bus
    rolling up out front.

    suddenly, ray remembers:

                            ray (cont'd)
              wait, wait.

    they turn around. she digs in her pockets.

                           ray (cont'd)
              here. lunch money.

    they take it and keep running for the bus.

    ray looks after them and reaches for her cigarettes. she
    takes out her second to last one. she lights it and takes
    out her mascara.

    she tries to put it on the bathroom mirror, but her tears
    keep getting in the way.

                                                      cut to:
