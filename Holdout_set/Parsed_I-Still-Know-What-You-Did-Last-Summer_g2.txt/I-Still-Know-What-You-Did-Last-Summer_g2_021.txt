20	ext. tower bay hotel - day

	establishing. an opulent, carribean-style hacienda resort with all the
	accoutrements.

	the main building is two stories high with a tiled roof. a bell tower
	rises from one side. and, of course, it is surounded on all sides by
	suffocating fooliage.

	julie and karla take in the beauty of the resort.

					karla
			check it out.

	tow bikini girls

	catch the eyes of tyrell and will.

					tyrell
			yes, ma'am.

	karla thwacks him on the back of the head, but they're all having fun.

	the path widens. the trees part. it's even nicer up close. they walk
	across a tiled plaza.

	behind them, three young guys carry their girlfriends piggyback,
	racing each other toward the departure dock.

	our two arriving couples move on toward the entrace, passing a fenced
	tennis court on the left. a glass-paned orchid house straight ahead.
	and, on the right,

	a lush pool with a built-in jacuzzi in the shallow end. an outdoor
	thatched roof bar stands nearby -- and just beyonk it, a small pool
	house.

	a guy's unintelligible rasta voice calls out --

					rasta voice
			anybudorsomethin'?

	they turn to see titus, white guy, dreads, full-rasta demeanor. he's a
	phony, but sincere about it.

	titus approaches tyrell --

					titus
			my brother, can i interest you in the
			islands finest ganja?

					will
				(teasing)
			hey, tyrell, we found you brother.

					tyrell
				(wry)
			not possible.

					titus
				(undetered)
			who be wantin' the kind, the uber-
			sticky, the bwana, the depth-charge,
			the up-all-night-laughing-with-your-
			friends? who wants it? 'cause titus got
			it.

					will
			no, thanks.

					titus
			come on, man. everybody wants something.

	will and tyrell walk on. undetered, titus goes up to karla and julie.

					titus (cont'd)
			how 'bout you, ladies? lovely ladies.

	titus moves his hips.

					titus (cont'd)
				(lascivious)
			something i can do for you?

	karla looks him up and down, wrinkles her nose --

					karla
			take a bath, maybe.

					titus
			that's cold, but if that's how you
			want it.

	the group moves on. titus watches them go --

					titus (cont'd)
				(yelling after them)
			anybudorsomethin' you come and see me.
