15	int. plane - day

	a nearly empty jet. karla has her head on tyrell's shoulder. julie is
	reading a book.

	will's knuckles are white from gripping the armrests in fear, and his
	eyes are clenched shut. julie looks on with concern.

					julie
			just take deep breaths and think of
			something happy from childhood.

					will
			what if i don't have anything happy
			from childhood...sorry, i can't relax
			going five hundred miles an hour, or
			four thousand, four hundred feet a
			minute...
				(calculating)
			which is over seven hundred feet a
			second. imagine hitting something at
			seven hundred feet a second.

					julie
			deep breaths --

					will
				(no deep breaths)
			fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
			you can by surface-to-air missiles
			over the internet. planes use
			o-rings...which freeze in tap water.
			planes fall from the sky for
			practically no reason at all.

					julie
			you've got a better chance of
			getting hit by lightning.

					will
			right. planes get hit by lightning.
			they get hit by meteors. they hit
			other planes.

	tyrell shakes his head.

					tyrell
				(exasperated)
			something is gonna hit your butt if
			you don't quit complaining.

					karla
				(sypathetic)
			honey, some folks just can't fly.

	will doesn't move, frozen with fear of flying, but more closely bonded
	with the concerned julie.
