	estes by the ocean, near a boat.

					will
			hey estes.
				(beat)
			estes? where'd you go?

	estes doesn't answer right away -- he keeps his back to will.

					will (cont'd)
			you abandoning us? how come you
			didn't tell us you had a boat?

	estes picks up the boat's oar. he speaks low, almost inaudibly.

					estes
			this has to end. now.

					will
			what -- ?

	estes swings the oar, cracking will's head hard.
