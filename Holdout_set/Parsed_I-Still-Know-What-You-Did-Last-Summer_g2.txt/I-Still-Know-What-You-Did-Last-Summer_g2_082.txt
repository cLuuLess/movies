80	int. hotel attic - night

	julie helps karla back up onto a beam.

					nancy (cont'd)
			stay on the beams!

	karla and julie follow her precarious progress.

	ben climbs off the ladder to a beam. he watches them leap from beam to
	beam. his hook glints in the light.

	julie, karla, and nancy move toward the cathedral window. they turn.
	they are cut off. they spread out against the wall looking for an
	opening to get back to the hatch.

	ben feints toward nancy then swipes at julie --

	he misses. she leaps away. she looks down. instead of insulation, she
	sees a

	window into the honeymoon suite

	she sees her bed through a one-way mirror. julie stares, momentarily
	transfixed. karla is edging her way around the side of ben.

					ben
				(re: the mirror)
			you'd be amazed by what you'd see.
			my wife with every man on the
			island, for example.
				(to julie)
			and you, sexy...i loved watching you.

					julie
			you sick freak.

	ben suddenly whirls and lunges at karla. he grabs her, but they both
	lose their balance, teetering for a moment on one of the beams, before
	falling --

	they crash through the mirror --
