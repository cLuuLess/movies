	int. julie's bedroom

	she steps out of the bathroom, crossing toward the door.

					julie
			will?

	no answer. she peers through the peephole.

					julie (cont'd)
			is that you?

	she unlocks and opens it. nobody there.

	julie quickly closes the door and relocks it, her heart rate just
	begining to rise again as...

	klunk-klunk. she hears it again. then, the sound stops. but standing
	at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from. her eyes
	immediately go to...

	the closet

	damn. that's where it came from. she slowy pads across the room in her
	slippers toward the door. trembling...she reaches for the handle...and
	tugs it open!

	there's nothing. she stares a beat. drip drip drip.

	she sees something on the floor of the closet. she touches a finger to
	it.

	it's blood.

	she looks up.

	the dockhand

	comes dropping down at her, dangling, enmeshed in barbed wire. he's
	dying before our eyes. blood bubbling from his mouth. his body
	twitching.

	julie stares at the body. she's almost catatonic. she blinks. she
	blinks again.

	suddenly, in death convulsions, his arms fly toward her --

	she screams --
