65	int. hotel lobby - night

	the men head into the kitchen and bar area.

					will
			we'll only be a second, okay?

					tyrell
			yeah, wait right here, it's the
			safest place.

	karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches
	julie's eye. she walks across the lobby.

					karla
			julie, where are you going?

	julie keeps walking. she sees historical pictures of the hotel: work
	crews during construction; the first limbo contest; fishermen standing
	next to sailfish and marlin.

	near the pictures, julie sees the globe. it's spinning slowly.

	julie hesitates, then walks toward the globe. it stops spinning. she
	looks down at it.

	close on - the globe

	and julie's hand finding brazil. we see the capital is not rio, but
	brazilia. this is dawning on julie when we hear --

					estes (v.o.)
			brasilia.

	she jumps out of her skin. estes was standing right there in the
	shadows.

					estes (cont'd)
			that's the capital of brazil, not
			rio.

	karla screams.

	tyrell comes flying across the lobby past karla. he dives on estes,
	tackling him to the floor. will is right behind him.

					will/estes/tyrell
			let go. i got him. that's me. it's
			him. we got you...

					julie
			leave him alone.

	tyrell holds up battered estes --

					tyrell
			here's youre killer --

					estes
			no --

					will
			we found your voodoo crap --

					estes
			no --

	they shake estes, finally giving him a chance to speak.

					estes (cont'd)
			i found the bodies this morning...i
			tried to use the radio, but he
			already destroyed it.

					julie
			let him go. i believe him.

					karla
			come on, julie. you saw his room.

					estes
			i haven't hurt anyone...i stole
			those things to help you. to
			protect you.

					julie
			he's telling the truth. he could've
			easily killed me. he didn't.
				(beat while
				this sinks in)
			look, we didn't even answer the
			radio question right...this whole
			thing was a setup.

					karla
			what do you mean?

					julie
			rio isn't the capital of brazil. it
			was the wrong answer. sorry, we lose.

					tyrell
				(starting to lose it)
			you've got all these theories but
			where is he? where? where's your
			fisherman killer?

					julie
			i don't know.

					tyrell
				(losing it)
			you never do...the guy at the
			nightclub, the body in your room last
			night. little notes that only mean
			something to you. how do we even know
			you're not the one behind this --

	estes steps forward --

					julie
				(to tyrell)
			how do we know you're not?

					estes
				(to julie)
			i know who you're talking about. he
			used to work here at the hotel.
				(beat)
			and i've seen him around again. out
			in the woods by the orchard.

	they look at estes...is he telling the truth?

					estes
			i can't remeber his name, but i
			don't forget a face.
				(beseeching)
			i can show you...

	they stare a beat --

					will
			how do we know you're not setting
			us up?

					estes
			where else you gonna go, son?

	they look to the office, the gym...the sense of death surrounding
	them.

					karla
			i know i don't want to stay in
			here.

					julie
			we'll be better off in the open. if
			we stick together, maybe we can kill
			this creep for good.

					tyrell
			show us.

	they begin moving for the door.
