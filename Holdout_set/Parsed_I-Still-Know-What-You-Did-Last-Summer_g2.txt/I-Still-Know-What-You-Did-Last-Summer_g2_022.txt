23	int. hotel lobby - day

	the hotel is tastefully appointed with island decor. an ornate metal
	staircase leads up to the rooms -- and down (as the sign says) to a
	fitness center.

	in one direction, the foyer meets the entrance to a tropical
	restaurant/bar. and in the other, a looby lounge is visible --
	surrounded by four walls of books and hotel memorabilia.

	in a dark corner of the room, a uniformed maid named olga dusts off a
	massive wooden globe.

	julie smiles at the woman on their way through the lobby, but olga
	shyly looks away.

	arriving at the front desk, the four of them find it deserted. they
	wait patiently, then impatiently.

	angle on a desk bell

	as karla slaps it with her palm. the bell rings for a long time then
	fades into silence.

					karla
			hello? hello?

					julie
			where is everyone? i'll ask --

	julie turns to consult the maid.

	angle on the globe

	the big ball is spinning. but olga is no longer in sight.

	tyrell heads toward a door beside the counter with a sign which reads:
	private office.

					tyrell
			i'll scare somebody up.

	he grabs the knob and pulls the door open to...

	rrowwwr? a pit bull on a chain jumps up into his face -- its toothy
	maw snapping shut about a half inch from his nose.

					tyrell (cont'd)
			whoa!

	julie and karla laugh. karla goes to hit the bell once more -- only to
	have her hand grabbed in the process.

	karla gasps. pulls away. we see the hand belongs to the hotel manager
	-- brooks, balding, 40s, talks slowly, and seems to have secrets he
	won't share with guests.

					brooks
			what can i do for you?

					karla
			checking in...karla wilson.

	will saunters away to look at the books in the lobby.

					brooks
				(condescending)
			ah, yes. roll out the red carpet.
			our contest winners are here at
			last.

	he scans a sheet as tyrell stares at the pit bull.

					tyrell
			nice dog.

					brooks
			not really. i've found peices of
			guys like you in his stool.

	tyrell is put off by this aggressive comment.

					tyrell
			what's your problem, buddy?

					brooks
				(innocent)
			i don't have a problem in the world.

					julie
				(covering)
			it sure is a beautiful old hotel.

					brooks
				(proud)
			built in 1948 for a member of the
			rockefeller clan. the tile work was
			imported from spain. a lot of history
			in these walls...judy garland stayed
			here...hemmingway fished for marlin
			right off that dock --

					tyrell
			okay, we get it...it's old.

					brooks
			it'll outlive you, i'm sure.

	creepy thing to say. slides a registration form.

					brooks (cont'd)
			wilson comma karla...
				(sees something on
				the form)
			oh --

					karla
			oh, what?

	brooks covers --

					brooks
			you're in 201 and 202.

					karla
				(expecting this)
			is that bad?

					brooks
				(lying)
			not at all. those are our honeymoon
			suites.

	tyrell wraps his arms around karla. julie looks uncomfortably towards
	will.

					julie
			your what?

					brooks
			honeymoon suites. i take it you kids
			haven't exchanged vows, yet?

					julie
			we haven't exchanged anything.

					karla
			julie, we're talkin' suites!
				(excited)
			that'll be just fine with us.

					brooks
			and, while you're here, our marginally
			trained, off-season staff of five will
			attend to your every need.

					karla
			wait...did you say off-season?

					brooks
			july fourth weekend. storm season
			starts today. the clouds roll in like
			clockwork.

					julie
			storm season?

					brooks
			it's our version of winter.
				(hands over the keys)
			201 and 202. there's scrabble and
			parcheesi in the lobby. enjoy.

	and brooks turns away through the office door. they walk toward their
	rooms. will catches up with them.
