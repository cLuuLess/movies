9	ext. southport docks - day

	a small mound of red snapper is dumped -- wiggling and suffocating its
	way across the deck of a fishing boat.

	we pull away to reveal it's ray who's just done the dumping. a
	coworker, dave, friendly, playful, and down-to-earth, calls out from
	the dock --

					dave
			hey, ray...phone!

	ray takes the phone.

	we intercut.

					julie
			hi.

	ray is happy to hear her voice, but cautious.

					ray
				(beat)
			hey. i'm really glad you called...
			i'm sorry.

					julie
				(compassoinate)
			no, you don't have to be sorry. i'm
			the one --

					ray
			no, i shouldn't have left so fast...
			i was just...

					julie
			it's okay.

	dave holds up two wriggling snappers. he dances them toward each other
	in a puppetlike mating ritual, making kissing sounds and narrating --

					dave
				(as the fish)
			julie, i love you. i know i'm only a
			humble fish, but if you really look
			at it, you're a fish, too.
				(girl voice)
			oh, ray, you're right...do me like a
			snapper.
				(mashing the fish together)
			hey, something smells like fish...

	ray waves him away, concentrating on his call.

					julie
			ray, karla won a trip to the bahamas!
			an island called tower bay. and she
			wants us to come with her.

					ray
			what? the bahamas? you're kidding.

	dave's interest is piqued.

					julie
			we'd have a long weekend just to sit
			in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and
			swim, and...
				(sexy)
			you know...

					ray
			this weekend?

	dave is watching ray closely. ray's expression hardens.

					ray
				(hurt)
			you'll go away with you're college
			friends, but you won't go away with
			me?

					dave
			idiot. idiot. idiot.

	karla is watching julie.

					julie
			it's not you, it's southport. and
			it's the bahamas! and it's free!

	karla is watching julie.

					karla
			you gotta sell his butt on the
			bahamas?

					julie
			ray, come on. i want us to be
			together.

	ray thinks. dave looks at him like he's crazy.

					ray
				(can't give in)
			julie, we're working a big run up
			here. it's been crazy. we probably
			have to go out again tonight. i
			don't think i can do it.

					julie
			will you try...for me, please?

	dave moves one of the fish like it's been shot through the heart.

					ray
			okay, i'll try. but, listen...
				(martyrlike)
			if i don't make it up, then you go
			ahead and have a great time.

					julie
			ray...please try. i really miss you.
				(beat)
			okay. bye.

	she hangs up and karla sits next to her.

					karla
			that boy has got fish on the brain.
				(sensitive)
			hey, cheer up, charlie.
				(singing a rumba)
			we're going to the bahamas. bahama
			mama, yeah...
