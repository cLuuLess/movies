8	int. julie's apartment - day

	with morning sun filtering through her blinds, julie wakes up to the
	strange sound of thumping. she gets out of bed and slowly exits the
	room.

8a	int. julie's hallway to kitchen - day

	the noise gets louder as she heads down the hall.

	angle on a closet

	the noise is at its loudest -- julie reaches for a doorknob -- and
	yanks open the door.

	angle on a clothes dryer

	rocking and banging inside the closet. julie frowns.

	julie spins, once again startled by karla, who crosses to the dryer,
	flipping open the lid and then jumping back to catch the shoes as they
	pop out on the fly.

					julie
				(still sleepy)
			that could break the machine.

					karla
			julie, people who end up making
			rules like that end up beating
			their kids with wire hangers. it's
			a fact.

	the phone rings. karla looks at her watch.

					karla (cont'd)
			it's tyrell.

					julie
				(resigned)
			the number's unlisted...

					karla
			would you relax? we've been dating
			three months. he ain't stalking
			your butt.

					julie
			okay, okay. you're right.

					karla
			i know it, and it feels good.
				(answering the phone)
			hi, ty.

	a dj for a local radio station booms from the phone.

					mark (v.o.)
			this is mark in the morning for
			magic 96.7 radio station! who am i
			speaking with?

	julie watches her friend get excited.

					karla
			mark in the morning! magic 96.7! oh
			my god! i'm karla. karla wilson.
				(to julie)
			jules, it's mark in the morning.

					mark (v.o.)
			well, karla, what're you doin' at
			home over the long fourth weekend?

					karla
			well, i'm in school and --

					mark (v.o.)
			how'd you like to win a magic 96.7
			quicky getaway?

					karla
			yes!

	julie hits the speakerphone button and karla hangs up. the dj's voice
	echos through the appartment.

					mark (v.o.)
			good, then i hope you remember your
			geography, karla, because all you
			have to do to win is tell me the
			capital of brazil.

	karla's smile abruptly fades.

					karla
				(into phone)
			brazil? um...

	she looks to julie, whose face is as blank as hers.

					karla (cont'd)
			you don't know?! you have to know.
			you know everything...

					mark
			c'mon, karla, one easy question,
			one great getaway!

					julie
				(shrugs)
			...south america...carnival...

					mark (v.o.)
			karla, we need an answer. no
			looking it up.

					karla
			still here...thinking...
				(stalling)
			you mean brazil, the country?

					mark (v.o.)
			okay, karla, five seconds.
				(counting down)
			five...four...

	julie has an idea. she scramles for the kitchen. grabs a bag of fresh-
	ground coffee from the freezer.

					mark (cont'd, v.o.)
			three...two...

	julie tosses the bag across the room to karla. karla reads the label:
	rio blend -- 100% brazilian coffee.

					karla
				(blurting)
			rio de janeiro!

					mark (v.o.)
			oh, no...did you say rio?

					karla
				(wincing)
			no. yes?

	bells and whistles and triumphant music.

					mark (v.o.)
			you just won magic 96.7's quickie
			getaway...a trip for four to tower
			bay island in the fabulous bahamas.

	karla and julie jump up and down ecstatically.

					karla
			waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!

					mark (v.o.)
			we'll call you back with all the
			details...so what's your favorite
			radio station?

					karla and julie
			magic 96.7!

	julie hangs up and joins karla dancing on the couch.

					karla
			i won. i won...i won, i won, i won.
				(teasing)
			now, let's see...there's tyrell,
			that's one. and, there's my parents
			...and i got some cousins.
				(beat)
			okay, julie, you can come, but mark
			said four tickets. that means you
			gotta get yourself a date.

	julie thinks, she seems torn.
