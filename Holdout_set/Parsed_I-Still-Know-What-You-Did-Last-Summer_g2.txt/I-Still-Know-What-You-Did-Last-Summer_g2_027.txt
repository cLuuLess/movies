28	int. hotel - julie's room - night

	julie steps into her room. closes the door behind her. she falls back
	against it, trying to calm herself down.

					julie
			there's no way...just stop it right
			now...

	she looks around the cozy room.

					julie (cont'd)
			closet. bed. bathroom. no need to panic.

	julie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally
	catching up with her. she grabs something to sleep in. tosses it on
	the bed. and that's when she sees it,

	close - envelope

	propped on the pillows. her name written across. she is frozen
	momentarily.

	almost against her will, she moves toward the envelope. she reaches
	down and picks it up.

	she hesitates, then opens the envelope. she pulls out a single white
	card.

	angle on the card

	in bold print it reads: surprise!

	darkfigure

	appears over julie's shoulder. julie can feel the presence. she spins,
	scaring --

	will

	who yells and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. the
	bottle bursts and covers them with spray.

					julie
				(realizing)
			oh, will! i'm sorry.

					will
			it's my fault. i shouldn't have...i
			didn't think...

	she grabs a towel off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up
	the mess.

					julie
			no, no, no. this was really sweet...

					will
			i scared you -- i crossed the line --

					julie
			no -- it's not that. it's...i'm just a
			little on edge. i'm really sorry.

					will
			hey, you don't have to appologize to me.
			i'm the one. i understand.
				(covering the awkwardness)
			i'm going to take a walk and dry off.

					julie
			are you sure? i really appreciate it.

	he picks up a rose. most of its petals on the floor.

					will
			i just really like you and i want you to
			feel good about everything...you know? i
			want you to be happy.

	he hands the rose to her. there's a moment between them. he
	reluctantly heads for the door.

28a	ext. hotel hallway - night

	will looks down at his wet pants.

					will
				(soto)
			dork.

	passing karla and tyrell's room on his way down the hall, will spots
	the do not disturb sign.

	he hears an incredible pounding from inside. he shakes his head and
	mopes down the hall.
