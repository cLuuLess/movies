75	int. hotel foyer - night

	julie, karla, and nancy run into the lobby. the storm is wailing
	outside the front doors.

	they pause for a second. behind them we hear the rapid thud-thud-thud
	of ben's boots.

	nancy goes straight to a desk and pulls out a flashlight. she points
	to the main staircase.
