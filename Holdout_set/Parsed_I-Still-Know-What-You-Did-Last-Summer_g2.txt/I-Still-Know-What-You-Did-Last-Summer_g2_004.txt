3	int. colledge lecture hall - day

	still screaming -- julie jumps back, seemingly knocked out of her
	chair. she fights the unseen demon.

	sitting beside her, julie's friend will benson reacts. he's a good-
	looking kid in a shy, humble kind of way. and he tries to help her,
	but she's too busy turning ten shades of red.

	the professor lowers his glasses, makes it even worse.

					professor
			nice to see you find political
			science so stimulating --

	the lecture hall erupts with laughter.

					julie
			i'm sorry --

	julie grabs her stuff and bolts.
