50	int. tanning room - day

	julie's eyes suddenly open through the goggles. she thumbs off her
	walkman.

					julie
			you say something?

	nothing. and just as julie lies down again, karla's frantic screams
	echo down the hall.

	julie goes to push open the canopy. as she does, the canopy lid is
	jammed down on top of her. a chain shoots through the handles. julie
	is locked on the grill.

					julie (cont'd)
			karla! somebody? hey, this isn't
			funny.

	suddenly the lights go off. julie thrashes around, trying to free
	herself.

	julie's pov - through the purple light

	she sees someone walking around in the room. the person steps closer.
	julie could almost reach out and touch him.

	she begins to scream!
