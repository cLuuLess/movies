78	int. hotel attic - night

	julie, karla, and nancy surround the hatch they've just shut. they
	fumble with it --

					julie
			there's no way to lock it.

					karla
			what do we do?

	from below comes laughter. there's a tug on the hatch, cracking it
	open. the girls pull it back shut, but it's hard to get a grip.

	there's more tugging, the hatch bending down; they can see ben. then,
	the rope snaps. the hatch slams shut.

					nancy
			there's no way to grip this thing.

	suddenly the steel tip of the hook pokes through the crack...it
	wriggles around...turning...and begins to pull the hatch down.

	they try to hold it...but it's no use. they let go and jump away.

	the attic is lit by a cathedral window. it's crosshatched with wooden
	beams and pink insulation.

					nancy
			watch your step...

	thunk! karla's foot goes through a gap between two beams.
