5	ext. julie's apartment - day


	students throw frisbee in the street. ray walks to his old truck,
	which is wedged between a new sport utility and a bmw.

	he clambers into the front seat. he thinks. then, digs into his pocket
	and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an engagement ring box. he
	throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away.
