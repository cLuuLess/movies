10	ext. southport docks - day

	ray is staring unhappily at the little pile of snapper. dave is
	staring at him in disbelief.

					dave
			man, what is your problem? we
			haven't caught anything for days.
			pull the big ugly stick out of
			your butt. she asked you to go to
			the bahamas! man, you gotta go.
			we'll both drive up. i got friends
			i can see up there.

	ray realizes how right he is.

					ray
			stupid. stupid.

					dave
			stupid. what were you thinkng?

	ray looks at dave a contemplative beat, then walks over to his truck.
	he leans in the passenger side and pulls out the engagement ring box.
	dave walks over.

					ray
			you wanna see what i've been
			thinking?

	he holds up the box and slowly opens it. dave is stunned.

					dave
			jeez, ray, fourth and forty, throw
			the bomb.

					ray
			i should go up there. i should call
			her back, tell her i'm coming.

					dave
			no way, man. surprise her. she'll be
			psyched.

	ray is excited by the plan and dave's right there with him.
