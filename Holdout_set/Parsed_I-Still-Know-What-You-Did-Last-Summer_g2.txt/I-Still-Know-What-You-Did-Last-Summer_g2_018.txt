17	ext. ferry - day

	more of a small tub than a ferry. julie, karla, will, and tyrell are
	the only passengers.

	at the bow, julie and karla laugh and play "king of the world." julie
	in the prow, karla behind her.

					julie
				(deadpan)
			i'm the king of the world.

					karla
				(deadpan)
			no, i'm the king of the world.

	they switch places. they look at each other and crack up laughing.
	karla takes in the surroundings, the salt spray, the day --

					karla
			remind me to study real hard so
			someday this is normal and all that
			back there is somethin' i do for a
			weekend once every ten years.

					julie
				(sharing the moment)
			i will, and you remind me of the same
			thing.

	they throws their arms around each other and stare into the horizon.

	at the stern

	will talks to a very green tyrell.

					will
			you just gotta breathe.

	tyrell is trying to keep from puking --

					tyrell
			can't talk right now.

					will
				(slightly malicious)
			see, it's not a macho thing. it's
			about equilibrium in your inner ear.
			you could've used a patch, but it's
			too late now. get used to it.
				(then)
			some folks just can't sail.

	paulsen, the boat captain, overhears as he passes --

					paulsen
			that's too bad, too, because it's the
			only way on or off the island.
				(slightly ominous)
			unless you have an accident. and then
			they call the coast guard.

	julie and karla have rejoined the men.

					julie
			it's pretty remote here.

					paulsen
				(smiles)
			yep. that's what the tourists pay for
			-- sun, sea, and solitude.

					tyrell
			are we there yet?

					paulsen
			few more minutes.

	we move off the boat and reveal the island. the intrepid vacationers
	excitedly take in the island.
