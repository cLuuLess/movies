36	int. hotel tower room - night

	it's a claustrophobic room. estes turns away from the window,
	shirtless in his uniform pants. a beaded cord hangs around his neck,
	small fishhook dangling from it.

	beside the candle, he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful
	of voodoo icons: roots, coins, sea glass, chicken's foot. he sets them
	on a divination tray.

	he opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small
	wooden bowl. he opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush. he dips the
	brush in the bowl -- covering its bristles with a sticky goo. he holds
	the brush over the candle's flame. the old man watches it sizzle.

	estes picks up

	a straw figure

	and impales it on his fishhook necklace.

	his eyes roll back in his head. he enters a trance.
