39	int. pawn shop - night

	close on an engagement ring

	ray's engagement ring. the pawn shop owner, mac, cowboy hat, knows his
	job, holds it up to the viewing loop next to his eye.

					mac
			jeez, that's a full carat --

					ray
			how much?

					mac
			well, there's some flaws in her...

					ray
			how much?

	mac looks around his shop at the usual jumble of crap: vacuum
	cleaners, golf clubs, guitar amps...

					mac
			don't really have the market for
			something like this...
				(like it hurts him)
			i can go two...two-fifty.

					ray
			make it three hundred. and throw
			that in, too.

	reveal - .38 revolver

	encased in a glass cabinet.

					mac
			hell, that's worth three, easy. and
			you got your waiting period.

					ray
			i'm not waiting...so give me the gun
			and keep the ring.

	mac barely hasitates, he knows he's getting a steal --

					mac
			fine, buddy.

	the gun and the ring

	go down on the counter next to each other. mac pulls out some forms.

					mac (cont'd)
			fill these out. leave the dates blank.

	ray starts writing. mac is overcome by a moment of humanity.

					mac (cont'd)
			buddy, are you sure this is the way
			you want to go?

	ray gives him a steely stare --

					ray
			is it loaded?

	mac shakes his head.

					ray (cont'd)
			load it.

	off mac's sadness at young people today.
