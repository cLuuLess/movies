105	ext. hotel - night

	ray and julie limp across the grounds of the hotel. they are moving
	past some shrubbery when

	a dark figure

	jumps out. julie yells. she and ray jump back.

	karla

	stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack, knife held out.

					karla
			oh, god, it's you --

					julie
			you're okay. thank god.

					karla
			is he?

	they nod. they go to her -- jubilant group hug time. they compose
	themselves.

					karla (cont'd)
			you know, it's true what they say
			about package vacations...you get
			what you pay for.
				(beat)
			now, how about we get off this piece
			of crap island.

	the first rays of the morning sun appear. ray looks adoringly at julie
	as the beautific light catches her face.

	ray kisses her. she kisses him back. they are silhouetted against a
	beautiful orange sunrise.

					julie
				(smiling)
			we don't have to tell anyone it
			rained the whole time. it can just
			be our little secret.

	the three of them throw their arms around each other's shoulders and
	they start walking for the beach as...

	a coast guard helicopter

	rises into view.
