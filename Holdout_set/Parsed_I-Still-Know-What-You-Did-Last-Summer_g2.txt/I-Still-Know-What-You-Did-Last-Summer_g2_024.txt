25	int. hospital emergency room - night

	beep. beep. beep. ray is hooked up to a heart monitor. although he's
	asleep, we can tell he's bruised and generally beaten up.

	we rack to a doctor checking on him through the glass.

25a	int. hospital room - night

	we see a cop next to the doctor.

					cop
			he's beaten up pretty bad --

					doctor
			yes, but he seemed certain his friend
			was killed out on the highway by
			somebody named ben willis.
				(hisitant)
			he said he has a hook on his hand. he
			said he was driving a bmw.

	as the cop stares at him deadpan, the doctor realizes how rediculous
	this must sound.

25b	int. hospital room - night

	close up: ray's eyes pop open. he's listening.
