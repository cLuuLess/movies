61	ext. hotel docks - day

	julie is at the end of the dock. tears are streaming down her face,
	her chest heaving.

	the others catch up with her. karla realizes the boats are gone.
	everyone is freaking out.

					karla
			there were boats here? refresh my
			memory, there were boats...

	tyrell picks up the end of a cut mooring line --

					tyrell
			they were cut loose.

					will
			julie? wanna tell us what is
			going on here?

	they look at julie. their escape is cut off by water. they're scared.

					julie
				(freaking out)
			we're all going to die. he's going
			to kill us one by one.

					tyrell
			who?

					julie
			ben willis.

					karla
				(not this again)
			oh, stop it! he's dead. you killed
			him. now, get over it. we gotta
			think here.

					julie
			they never found the body.

	her voice is low and urgent, an impromptu confessional.

					julie (cont'd)
			two summers ago. we lied to the
			authorities. we hit ben willis with
			our car. ray, me, barry, and helen
			...we threw the body in the water to
			cover it up --

					karla
			julie...

					julie
			only he wasn't dead. he killed barry
			and helen last july fourth.

	tyrell begins backing away from julie. he picks up a piece of
	driftwood from the dock.

					julie (cont'd)
			i thought ray and i killed him on the
			boat, but we didn't and now he's back
			to finish up the job.

	tyrell holds up the log as a weapon. he's angry and afraid --

					tyrell
			we're on an island, miles from
			anywhere. i don't give a crap about
			you're fisherman. there's dead bodies
			pilling up everywhere and there's one
			guy missing --

	will moves closer to tyrell --

					will
			the porter...what's his name? old
			asbestos --

					tyrell
			estes! that's exactly who it is. that
			old guy knows something. we can sit
			here and wait for him to pick us off
			or we can go find him first.

	tyrell turns and heads down the dock. will goes with him. karla takes
	a few hesitant steps after them, then turns back toward julie, who
	hasn't moved.

					karla
			julie, we have to do something.

	julie sees her friend caught in the middle, sees her suffering. she
	reluctantly starts for karla --

					julie
				(sotto)
			it's not him.
