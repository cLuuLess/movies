37	int. hotel corridor - night

	olga, the maid, pushes her laundry cart toward the end of a long,
	dimly lit hall. she sees a pile of dirty linens outside of a room --
	room 228.

	she stops, perplexed. there's nobody staying in this room. she picks
	them up and stuff them in her cart. then she knocks on the door.

			housekeeping.

	she knocks again and notices her hand leaving bloody marks on the
	door. she looks at her other hand. her arms and hands are covered in
	blood.

	she turns back to the linens. something bloody is wrapped inside of
	them. she paws at the sheets, trying to unravel the mystery --

	the door the room 228 slowly cracks open. a steel hook reaches out and
	slices into her apron. it tugs. she turns, and she starts to scream,
	she is yanked into the room.

	a do not disturb sign flips over the handle and the door slams shut.

	we hear her screams from inside.
