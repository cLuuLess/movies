24	int. hotel hallway - day

	they walk down the hallway. karla seems annoyed.

					karla
			ain't nothin' free in this world.
			everybody says it, and it's true.
				(dissapointed)
			i wanted you all to have a good trip.

					tyrell
			we will, baby...all this means is we
			got the whole island to ourselves.

					will
			and it's been blue skies all day. it
			might be perfect all weekend.

					julie
			it beets being on the mainland.

					karla
			oooh, the mainland --

					tyrell
			somebody's gone tropical on us, baby.
			tropical!

	the mood is improving. a squeeking noise interupts.

	a brass luggage cart has appeared behind them. and estes, 60s, the
	weary haitian porter, steps from behind it.

					estes
				(a carribean accent)
			201 and 202...who put you in...?
				(hesitant)
			don't use these much --

					julie
				(suspicious)
			why's that?

	he sees their happy, expectant faces and changes the subject.

					estes
			no real reason.
				(then)
			pretty fancy rooms for kids your age.

					karla
			we won a competition.

					estes
			oh, yeah? what you have to do?

					tyrell
			guess the capital of brazil --

					karla
			rio, baby!

					estes
			ahh, good for you, girl.
				(waiting for a cue)
			...and, where would you like me to
			put the bags?

	a beat as julie and karla exchange a look. then, karla tosses one of
	the keys to julie.

					karla
				(to estes)
			their stuff in there...
				(grabbing tyrell)
			...and ours in here.

					julie
			karla! you promised.

					karla
				(looking at tyrell)
			i also promised tyrell.

					tyrell
			promised me what, baby?
				(joking around)
			i made all my promises to william.

	tyrell makes fake goo-goo eyes at will. estes looks away.

					tyrell (cont'd)
			sweetie, you brought your nightie,
			didn't you?

					will
			forward! a girl needs time to make up
			his mind.
				(to julie, thoughtful)
			julie, look, if it's cool, i'll sleep
			on the couch and they can have their
			own room to practice for that real
			honeymoon.

	but tyrell grabs karla and drags her into the room. we here giggles.

					will
			i'll take those.

					estes
			no, i've been doing this since before
			you were a dream in your father's eye.

	estes grabs the bags and takes them into the room. julie and will are
	left staring at each other.

					will
			you sure it's okay with you?

					julie
				(noting his sweetness)
			sure. it's fine. as long as you don't
			snore.

					will
			you can toss a shoe at me if it gets
			out of hand.

	she laughs and they go into the room.
