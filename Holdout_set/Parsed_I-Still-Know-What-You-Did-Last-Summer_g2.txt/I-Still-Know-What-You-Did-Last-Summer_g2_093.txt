	julie and nancy arrive at the door. karla pounds on the other side --
	points to the lock.

					karla
			it's locked!

	nancy sees a key ring by the door.

					nancy
			it's gotta be one of these.

	nancy tries the first of many keys. something catches julie's eye. she
	moves in for a closer look. her eyes go wide --

	orchid house - julie's pov

	a powerful bolt of lightning cracks. fills the room with a pulse of
	bright light. ben is standing inside and he's heading straight for
	karla.

					julie
				(terrified)
			he's inside.

	karla spins. sees him. her terrified scream blends with the cranes,
	now shrieking violently.

					karla
			please! hurry!
