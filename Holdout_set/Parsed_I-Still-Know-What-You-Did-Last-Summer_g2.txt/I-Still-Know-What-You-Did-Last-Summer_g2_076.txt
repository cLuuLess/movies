74	ext. offshore on ferry - night

	ray pilots the boat through the dark, choppy water. he's navigating by
	compass, maps spread before him. he sees something off the bow --

	a boat

	drifting on the fast sea. the words "tower bay" are painted on the
	side. ray pulls alongside and discovers the boat is empty.

	he reaches for the radio.

					ray

			come in...this is summer breeze
			requesting emergency assistance for
			tower bay island. i repeat...this
			is summer breeze...

	ray guns the boat away.
