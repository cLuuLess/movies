	titus sits on the floor facing away from them, facing a window through
	which gray light pierces the gloom.

	titus falls over like a block of wood, rictus already setting in.

	his hands are bound behind him. the cord is tied off to some pipes
	against the wall.

	into the floor, scrabbling for the window and fresh air.

	will points out two empty one-gallon plastic bottles.
