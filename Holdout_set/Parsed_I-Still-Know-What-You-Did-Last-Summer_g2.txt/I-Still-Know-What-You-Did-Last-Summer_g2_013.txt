12	int. ray's pickup - night

	the music's even louder in here. the mood is high...two buddies going
	to propose to a girl. dave adjusts the radio to another am station --

					dave
			man, i love am radio. you got
			right-wing conspiracy, tips for
			pregnant womem, single-a baseball
			games, and real country music...
			none of that new crap...

	he adjusts the dial again, tuning in a country song, "mamas, don't let
	your babies grow up to be cowboys," by waylon jennings and willie
	nelson.

	dave starts singing along, extra loud and out of tune.

					dave (cont'd)
				(singing)
			"...mamas, don't let your babies grow
			up to be cowboys, don't let 'em pick
			guitars and drive them old trucks. let
			'em be doctors and lawyers and such."

	ray looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy
	himself...

	then, ray sees something in the road ahead. he turns down the radio.
	they both stare --

	ray's pov: a car turned sideways

	its hazards blinking.

	ray slows and creeps past the car. the driver's door is open. it
	appears empty.

	a body

	is sprawled out in the road away from the car. ray pulls over to the
	shoulder and stops.

					dave
				(nervous)
			i don't know, man. maybe we should
			keep going, find a phone --

					ray
			no.

					dave
			the guy looks dead.

	ray has seen this before --

					ray
			maybe not.

	he throws open his door.

12a	ext. roadway - night

	ray steps from his truck. looks back at the empty car, then turns
	toward the body.

					ray
				(nervous)
			hey! buddy, what's up?

	the body doesn't move.

	behind ray

	and behind dave, in the other car, a figure in a slicker sits up in
	the back seat and gets out of the car.

	ray continues toward the body.

	rays pov - body

	face down -- wearing a black rain slicker.

	ray moves closer to the all to familiar image.

	behind ray

	slicker figure moves toward the unsuspecting dave.

12b	int. ray's pickup - night

	dave watches ray in the road. he leans across the seat and rolls up
	ray's window.

	behind him, the slicker figure gets closer, moving to the passenger
	side of the truck.

12c	ext. median - night

	ray nears the body. he kneels down.

					ray
			hey, can you hear me?

	ray reaches toward the body...

12d	int. ray's pickup - night

	something flashes in the side-view mirror.

12e	ext. road - night

	ray turns over the body. something isn't right. ray jumps back --

	close - slicker mannequin

	its eerie smile mocking ray who turns for the truck.

					ray
			dave!

12f	ext. truck - night

	dave hears something. he turns to late. spllaattt!!! the fisherman
	jams his hook through dave's jaw and skull and yanks dave out of the
	car window.

					ray
			...dave?

	there's no answer from dead dave. ray tries to see around the
	headlights. he moves slowly toward the truck.

	the brights and fogs come on, blinding ray. the truck's engine revs.
	the truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on ray.

	then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at ray.

	ray runs at the truck. at the last minute, he ducks behind the parked
	car.

	his truck goes screaming past.

	ray backs around the car --

	an eighteen-wheeler

	goes barreling by in the other direction. ray dives out of the way.

	in the road

	ray is exposed. he sees his truck closing fast. he's got nowhere to
	go. then, at the very last second,

	ray

	jumps off the edge of the road. his truck slams into the barrier right
	where ray was standing. sparks fly! metal buckles!

	ray falls through the air. lands hard on his leg. tumbles down the
	hill, finally stopping with a crash. he lies motionless at the bottom
	of a ravine.
