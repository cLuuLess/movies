90	int. orchid house - night

	a sprawling, steam-filled room, dense with vegetation of all sorts and
	shelf after shelf of beautiful orchids.

	karla lies unconscious. slowly, she opens her eyes.

	there's a rustling in the flowers. she tries to get up, but can't yet.
	she waits in terror as

	birds

	fly up and out of the hole she's made in the roof.

	karla tries to stand and her leg gives way. she tests her knee --

					karla
			oww...

	karla starts hobbling. she reaches the door -- it's locked from the
	other side.

	there is a thick glass window set in the middle of the door.

	the cranes startle again, something upsetting them. karla spins to
	look. nothing.
