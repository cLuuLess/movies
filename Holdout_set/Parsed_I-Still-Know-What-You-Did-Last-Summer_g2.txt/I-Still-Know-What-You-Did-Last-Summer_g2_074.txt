	tyrell steps inside.

			steel door...food...perfect.

	he starts looking for something to eat --

	clank. there's a soft clattering from somewhere in the room. everyone
	freezes, staring into the darkness.

	tyrell puts a finger to his lips, then creeps down an aisle,
	listening. there's nothing but silence.

	he moves toward the first aisle...he jumps out. the aisle is empty.

	julie and karla

	move down an aisle behind him.

	tyrell ducks around to the second aisle. he slices the air, ready to
	pounce. this aisle is empty.

	julie and karla

	nervously move another aisle down.

	tyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle...this is it. he lunges
	forward into the row...empty, also.

					julie

	nancy, the bartender steps out of the shadows brandishing her rolling
	pin.
