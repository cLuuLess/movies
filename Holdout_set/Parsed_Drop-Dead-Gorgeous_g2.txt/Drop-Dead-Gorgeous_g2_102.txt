	ext. gymnasium - hallway

	iris and servettes go in the gym as chloris klinghagen 
	comes out.

				chloris
			(loud whisper)
		opening number looked, uh, good.  
		solid.  but now you're gonna have to 
		actually dance, so...
			(holds up jar of vaseline)
		here.  put a dab of this on the old 
		choppers, ladies.  it'll help you 
		smile.  and when they're lookin' at 
		your teeth - god willin' - they won't 
		be lookin at your feet.

	chloris gives amber the jar and exits.  from the gym, we 
	hear taped patriotic music.  contestants cheer and run 
	in.

	"physical fitness" routine - patriotic music

	as cuts of patriotic dance moves progress, the girls have 
	more and more red, white and blue paint smeared on their 
	clothes, arms and legs.

	amber's clearly the best.

	taped music ends.  contestants, covered with paint, 
	strike a final pose - sitting on ladders, standing, 
	kneeling.  applause.

	backstage - walkway

	contestants wait anxiously as they pass a can of 
	turpentine and a rag to remove paint from their arms and 
	legs.

				becky
		hurry up.

				leslie
		okay, guys, i think we all got some.  
		you just take it off.

				amber
		here, i didn't get any.

				leslie
		here, have some.

				michelle
		hand me another white one.

				lisa
		listen, you guys, don't go int the 
		bathroom.  tess blew chunks all over. 
		man, she ate a big dinner.

				becky
		maybe she shoulda shoved that lucky 
		bolt down her throat for desert.

	becky storms off.

				amber
			(sotto, to other girls)
		and the winner of the "spirit" award 
		goes to...

	girls laugh quietly.  iris pulls a dazed and confused 
	tess - beg wet spot on her shirt - through the shot.
