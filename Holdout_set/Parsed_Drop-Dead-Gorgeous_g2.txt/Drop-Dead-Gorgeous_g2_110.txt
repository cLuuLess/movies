	int. high school - gym - stage

	gladys guides molly off the stage.

		now, it's with overwhelming pride that 
		i introduce contestant number six, who 
		also happens to be president of her 
		class - two years running - a member 
		of the honor roll and the new 
		president of the lutheran sisterhood 
		gun club - rebecca ann leeman!

	stage goes black.  spot hits becky, who sits at the edge 
	of the stage, holding a mic.  she's head to toe sequins 
	in her poodle skirt, sweater, saddle shoes, etc.

			(talking over music)
		i don't know how many of you know 
		this, but i've got a very special 
		fella in my life - that's right, i 
		do... and if nobody minds, i'd like to 
		sing a little song, just for him.

	spot follows as becky stands and walks center stage to 
	what appears to be a covered mannequin.  taped intro to 
	"i can't take my eyes off you."

				becky (cont'd)
		you're just too good to be true.  
		can't take my eyes off of you.  you'd 
		be like heaven to touch.  i wanna hold 
		you so much.  at long last love has 
		arrived and i thank god i'm alive.  

	becky removes the sheet, revealing a mannequin dressed 
	like jesus as he appeared on the cross: long hair, beard, 
	crown of thorns, loincloth.  the arms are stuffed so they 
	move freely.  (hands of stigmata.)

				becky (cont'd)
		you're just to good to be true.  can't 
		take my eyes off of you...

	becky talk-sings - a la william shatner's "rocket man" - 
	and dances around the jesus mannequin doing the jitter-
	bug, the twist and a slow dance (his arms on her 
	shoulders).

	during the slow dance, the loin cloth slips and becky 
	must hold it up - giving the appearance of grabbing his 
	crotch.
