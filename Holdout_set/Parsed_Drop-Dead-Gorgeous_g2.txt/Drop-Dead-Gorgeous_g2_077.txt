	ext. trailer park street/int. hearse - night

	amber drives fast and furious as we come to what's left 
	of her trailer.  all the neighbors are out drinkin' 
	beers, eatin' food and watchin' the excitement.

				amber
		oh my god - no!  is my mom okay?  was 
		she home?

	hearse screeches to a halt.  we hear a thud, then moans 
	from in back.  amber jumps out.  camera follows, a la 
	"cops."  it's pandemonium with fire trucks, neighbors, an 
	ambulance, etc.

				amber (cont'd)
		mom!  mom!?  mommmm!

	loretta runs up to amber as two firemen approach.

				fireman #1
		you family?

				loretta
		no, she's just screamin' "mom, mom!" 
		kcause she's got tourettes... she's 
		annette's kid, dipshit.

				amber
			(to loretta)
		is mom okay?

				loretta
		she's alive, sweetie.

				amber
		where is she?!

				loretta
		she's right over there.

	camera pans over to see a semi-conscious annette as they 
	load her stretcher into the ambulance, shut the doors and 
	start to pull away.  amber runs after them.

				amber
		mommmm!  i'll be right behind you in 
		the hearse!

				loretta
		don't let that worry you, annette!
