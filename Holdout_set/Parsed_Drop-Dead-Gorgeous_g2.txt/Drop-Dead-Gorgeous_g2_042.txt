	amber fixes mary's hair, carefully brushing her balding 
	head.  mary smiles, oblivious.

			(labored breaths)
		...amber does my hair...once a week.

				amber
			(flattered and embarrassed)
		well...it's the least i can do for the 
		reigning mount rose junior miss amer--

	amber pulls the brush away with a clump of mary's hair 
	dangling from it.

				amber (cont'd)
		oh god...

				mary
		what?

				amber
		huh?  oh...uh, just a little snarl...

	amber mouths, "shhh!  don't tell!" to camera as she tries 
	to pull the clump of hair from the brush.
