	ext. loretta's trailer - day

	annette (left arm's been amputated and replaced with 
	metal pincers which she hasn't mastered yet) sits at the 
	picnic table with amber and loretta.  throughout the 
	following, annette struggles to open a beer can which 
	keeps flying out of her pincers.  (handmade 
	"congratulations" posters cover the lawn and trailer.)

				loretta

		lincoln, alabama - look out!

		sawyer.

	annette opens a beer with a new hook replacing her hand.

				loretta
		annette, just use your hand.  

				annette
		they told me to practice.

				amber
		okay, ready?  here's the signal i'm 
		gonna give ma when i'm on tv.

	amber mimes inhaling a cigarette and annette embraces 
	her.
