	int. leeman home - living room - day

	it looks like a levitz showroom.  gladys sits stiffly 
	between becky and her husband, lester - mid-60's, gruff, 
	"old school" salesman, drink in hand.

				lester
		...you betcha.  s'posed to be colder-n-
		a witches tit tonight...

				gladys
			(nervous laugh)
		oh, lester.  he loves his weather, 
		y'know.

				lester
			(looking to crew, o.s.)
		hey, ya like it?  open it...yah-the 
		globe.  pull at the equator there.

				gladys
		we're not in the showroom, dear.

	banging and fumbling.  a corkscrew flies into shot - crew 
	guy quickly enters shot and grabs it.

				lester
		fits three full-size booze bottles.  
		the cassette deck pulls outta 
		afghanistan, there.

				becky
			(embarrassed)
		mommm...

				gladys
		lester?

				lester
		oh, all right
			(to camera)
		how soon they forget where all this 
		comes from.
