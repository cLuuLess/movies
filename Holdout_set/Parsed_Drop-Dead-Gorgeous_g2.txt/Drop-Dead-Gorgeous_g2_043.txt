	int. dakota county eating disorders clinic - mary's room

	amber ties the tiara and missing clump of hair to mary's 
	head with a ribbon.

				amber
		there we go.

	she holds the mirror for mary.

				mary
			(delusional)
		beautiful... maybe next week... a 
		perm.

				amber
		yah... sure...

	amber gives a kind but worried smile to camera.  
	suddenly, becky leeman enters with a large box of 
	chocolates.  she's fully aware of the cameras from the 
	moment she enters.

				becky
		hellooo, little mary sunshine!
			(pretending to notice camera)
		what?!  oh-oh my god!  lights!  
		camera!  and me without a stitch of 
		make-up on.  what are you guys doin' 
		here?

	she's in full make-up.

				amber
		what're you doin' here?

				becky
		oh, amber, like you're the only one 
		who visits mary.

				mary
			(to becky)
		who are you?

				becky
			(covering)
		"who are you?!"  oh mary, you kill me.
			(to camera)
		she always says that.  it's a little 
		game we play.  every week - same dippy 
		little look on her face.  "who are you 
		- who are you?"  just like that.
			(in mary's face)
		it's me - becky - and i brought your 
		favorites.

	becky puts the chocolates on mary's lap, a few spill.  
	throughout the following, mary slowly reaches for them as 
	if they're forbidden fruit and she's a very hungry eve.

				amber
		how nice, becky, she's anorexic.

	becky roughly puts her hands over mary's ears, who's now 
	gently petting the spilled chocolates in her lap.

				becky
			(sotto, reprimanding tone)
		she's skinny, not deaf, amber.
