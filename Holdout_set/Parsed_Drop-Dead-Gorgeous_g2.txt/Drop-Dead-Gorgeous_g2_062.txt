	int. high school - kitchen

	move through kitchen.  lunch ladies haul, serve and 
	prepare food.  pan over to amber, who's unhappily 
	scraping and spraying lunch trays as they're dropped off 
	at her window.  becky, flirting her ass off, comes to the 
	window with brett, handsome football player we saw 
	before.  both carry trays.

				becky
		so, brett, do you wanna go to the lake 
		with me on thursday?

				brett
		um, actually, i got practice on 
		thursday.

				becky
		...yah-well, maybe friday, then.  a 
		bunch of us were gonna go cow-tippin'.

	super: brett clemmens, captain, mount rose high school 
	football team

				brett
			(seeing amber)
		uh, i-uh-i'm kinda busy friday.

	amber looks up to see brett looking at her.  he smiles.  
	she smiles.  you can feel the attraction.  amber becomes 
	girlishly self-conscious -- adjusting her rubber apron 
	and brushing hair out of her eyes with her big rubber 
	gloves.

				brett (cont'd)
			(to amber)
		hi...

				amber
		hi.

	becky notices their attraction and goes from flirt to 
	uber-bitch in a heartbeat.

				becky
		giver her your tray, brett.  you're 
		holdin' up the line.

	brett looks at beck, then at amber, not wanting to make 
	her clean his tray.

				brett
		uh...

				becky
		give it to her!

				amber
		here, i'll take it.  it's my job.

				brett
		no...
			(looking at becky)
		it's all right.  i got it.  don't 
		worry about it.

	he takes the sprayer from a surprised amber and starts to 
	clean off his own tray.  becky can't believe his 
	defiance.

				amber
		well, you're supposed to put it in 
		the...

	becky throws her tray on the counter spraying amber with 
	food as she storms off.

				brett (cont'd)
		oh man, you got leutefisk in your 
		hair.

				amber
		then it must be wednesday.
