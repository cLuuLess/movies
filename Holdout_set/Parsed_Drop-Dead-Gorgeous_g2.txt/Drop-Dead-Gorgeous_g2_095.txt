	int. high school - gym - day

	stage is dark.  crowd takes their seats.  you can feel 
	the electricity.

	we hear the tape of a drum roll.  spotlight hits center 
	stage.  gladys enters wearing a gaudy gown, takes mic.  
	applause!

				gladys
		welcome, welcome.  okay, alright, now.  
		is this for me or the gown?

	laughter and applause trail off.

				gladys (cont'd)
		welcome to the mount rose american 
		teen princess pageant.  while every 
		contestant you'll meet tonight is 
		special and unique, they all have one 
		thing in common.  they're all "proud - 
		to - be - an - american!"

	wild applause!  jazzy patriotic medley tape.  gym doors 
	fly open and like a felliniesque vegas review, 
	contestants enter wearing gowns and u.s. monument 
	headdresses.  they struggle to maintain balance as they 
	dance, moving only their arms, on stage.

								cut to:

	becky, whose head is built like another president into 
	mount rushmore, is first at the mic.  (the "dance" 
	continues behind each contestant as she steps up to the 
	mic.)

				becky
		i chose mount rushmore, because to 
		live in a country where you can take 
		an ugly old mountain and put faces on 
		it, faces of great americans, who did 
		so much to make our country super 
		great, well that makes me - rebecca 
		leeman - proud to be an american!
