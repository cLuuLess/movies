	int. high school - gym - backstage

	iris approaches lisa who's given her outfit to amber.

				iris
		c'mon, lisa.  you're up next.

				lisa
		i quit.  and, uh, since my costume, 
		y'know, was okay'd a month ago?  i'm 
		givin' it to amber.

	amber breaks a smile.

	taped music ends.  applause.  gladys, mic in hand, joins 
	becky for a big hug.

				gladys
		boy, i'd hate to follow that.  wow!

	becky exits, pulling the wheeled jesus behind her.

				gladys (cont'd)
		voice of an angel, that one.

	iris runs self-consciously out on stage, whispers in 
	gladys' ear, then runs back off stage.

				gladys (cont'd)
		...uh, i was just told that contestant 
		number seven, lisa swenson, has quite 
		the pageant.

	crowd reacts.

				gladys (cont'd)
		well, these things happen.  at any 
		rate, we still have one more 
		contestant - number eight, amber 
		atkins.

	gladys exits.  a taped hip, hot drum beat starts.  
	suddenly, amber glides into center spot.  (now wearing 
	lisa's costume, sleeves rolled up.)  her feet burst into 
	an amazing routine.  the loud drum beats seem to fly from 
	her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm.  there's 
	no glitz, just unbelievable skill.  it appears effortless 
	as she floats around stage.  like watching michael 
	jackson moon walk for the first time, you can't take your 
	eyes off her.  she concludes, center stage, with the 
	greatest thirty seconds of her life.  the audience goes 
	wild!  amber takes bow after bow - they love her.  gladys 
	enters quickly, mic in hand.

				gladys (cont'd)
		okay, okay, okay!  well, now, it's 
		finally time to say good-bye to our 
		judges, so they can go make the 
		toughest decision of their lives.

	pan to judges.  they look nervous as hell.  a relaxed 
	hank sniffs from a paint soaked bag.
