		oh-yah, this is exactly how i pictured 
		it.  chokin' on swan gas.

	suddenly, like a gasoline soaked pinata, it explodes!

	gladys is thrown back.  flames.  screaming.  pandemonium!  
	becky doesn't have a chance.  she's a pink taffeta ball 
	of fire.  the swan's back eventually collapses taking 
	becky into it's burning belly. 

	intercut with mr. howard's video.

	gladys watches in stunned silence as her daughter and 
	only chance at state go up in flames.  suddenly, she 
	cracks!

				gladys
		oh my god!  my baby!  the swan ate my 
		baby!
			(grabbing at burning float)
		ow-ow-ow!  get up, rebecca!  get outta 
		there!  we've gotta go to state!  oh 
		hot!
			(she scorches her blouse)
		oh, damn.  i like this blouse.  
		rebecca!  get up, angel face.  time to 
		go to state!  ow-ow-ow!

	eventually, gladys tries to climb up on the float.  iris 
	pulls her off.

				gladys (cont'd)
		get offa me, you cow!

	gladys spins and notices the silent crowd.

				gladys (cont'd)
		what're you lookin' at?  huh?  a whole 
		god damn town of losers!  that's what 
		i'm lookin' at!

	crowd reacts.  gladys notices amber and runs up to her 
	car.

				gladys (cont'd)
		you!  you piece-a-shit trailer trash!  
		this shoulda been you!  damn, i 
		shoulda killed you when i had the 

	the crows reacts again.  gladys spins, noticing someone.  
	lester approaches.

				gladys (cont'd)
		hey, ted, sorry.  i didn't know your 
		family was in the garage when i set it 
		on fire!

				lester
		gladys!  stop it!

				gladys
		guess it wasn't a garage sale as much 
		as it was a bake sale.  ah-
		hahahahahahahaha!

	lester tries to pull her away from the crowd.

				gladys (cont'd)
		let go-a-me, you old bastard!

	she grabs a burning 2x4 off a float and starts swinging 
	it.

				gladys (cont'd)
		at least you've got another daughter.

	crowd gasps.  then stunned silence.  camera circles 
	gladys and lester getting reaction shots of the crowd.

				lester
		so help me, gladys.

				gladys
		becky was my only shot at state!

				lester
		that's enough!

				gladys
		let go!  let go of me.  oh my god, 
		it's cops!

	twin officers, followed by "cops" tv crew, run up and 
	aggressively tackle gladys.  as the struggle on the 
	ground continues, crew guys go over and shake hands with 
	the "cops" crew - obviously knowing them.

				gladys (cont'd)
			(pointing to lester)
		he sells reproductions!  his 
		furniture's as fake as my orgasms!

	the cops crew begins to mingle with the documentary crew.

				scott
		hey, man, how're you doin'?

				documentarian (o.s.)
		hi!  what's up, scott?  you remember 
		bruce, right?

				scott
		long time, no see.

				documentarian (o.s.)
		bruce, that's roy.
			(they shake hands)
		roy, bruce.
