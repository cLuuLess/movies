	int. high school/stairwell - dressing area

	lisa, top hat, tails, giant "i love ny" button - and 
	others try to console a crying amber.  becky continues 
	singing o.s.

				lisa
			(arm around amber)
		oh, amber...

				amber
			(can't catch breath)
		i-i-i-i-i-, j-uh-j-uh-just wanted to 
		compe-e-e-e-ete.

				lisa
		i can't believe this is happenin'.  i 
		can't believe she said you couldn't...

	getting an idea, lisa starts to take off her jacket.

				lisa (cont'd)
		amber?  here.

				amber
			(still sobbing)
		"here," wh-wh-what?

				lisa
		my jacket.  take it kcause, y'know, i 
		got my costume okay'd before the 
		pageant.  you can wear it.

				michelle
		oh man, lisa, i wouldn't do this.

				leslie
			(to lisa)
		they're never gonna let you perform 
		naked.  i asked.

				lisa
		shut up, yous guys.  look, amber, i'm 
		not gonna win.  and let's be honest, a 
		family only needs one "liza" and you 
		know peter's got much better legs than 
		me.

				amber
		your parents'd kill you.

				lisa
		oh c'mon, i love kem, but you know 
		they only had me kcause peter needed a 
		kidney.

				amber
		lis, i want to, i really do, but... 
		oh, i can't.

				lisa
		then do it for peter.  mrs. leeman 
		used to call him a "skinny little fag" 
		when he'd bag her groceries.  he'd pop 
		his nancy-belt if his old jacket 
		somehow, i don't know, got her back.

				amber
		yah?

				lisa
		oh-you-beccha.

	amber hugs her and takes the jacket.
