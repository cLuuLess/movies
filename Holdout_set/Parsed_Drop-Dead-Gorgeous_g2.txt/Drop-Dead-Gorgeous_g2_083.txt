				amber
		nice mouth you got there, mom, but i-
		i'm not goin' through this again.

				annette
		you're not goin' through this again?  
		you?  you're not the one who knows how 
		jiffy pop feels.

				amber
		oh, c'mon... first the picture of 
		tammy, then brett clemens, now this?  
		it's scary.

				annette
		let me tell you "scary," amber.  look 
		at me.  do you wanna look like you 
		been rode hard and put away wet at my 
		age?  i'm a "lifer" here.  best i can 
		hope for is to end up in a descent 
		"raisin ranch" where they'll change me 
		twice a day.

				amber
		that's it, i'm goin'...

				annette
		honest to god, if i got to do it over?  
		i'd start walkin' outta this town the 
		minute i took my first step.  
		practically the only thing i wouldn't 
		do different is have you...

	amber sits on the bed.

				amber
		god i hope that's you and not your 
		concussion talkin'.

				annette
			(smiling)
		it's me...i just don't want this to be 
		the thing you'd do over.  this 
		pageant's your ticket outta here.  i 
		know you can win, amber.

				annette (cont'd)
		c'mere.  i love you so much.

				amber
		i love you much.

	annette hugs amber.
