	int. lutheran church basement - kitchen area - night

	close on framed school photo of tammy curry.  pull back 
	to see her letter jacket - scorched and torn (lutheran 
	gun club patch is missing) - and flowers.  continue 
	pulling back to reveal both are surrounded by buns, bars 
	and coffee on a long buffet table.  a line of somber and 
	repressed lutherans help themselves to the food.  
	servettes stand at the ready.  gladys and iris face the 
	camera.

				gladys
		well, you know, i think everyone's 
		doing really well considering the fact 
		that she was so young.

				iris
		it's always hard to see the young ones 
		called home, especially on an 
		exploding thresher.  it's just so odd 
		and gross.

				gladys
		you know that sometimes it's hard to 
		understand god's great plan.

				iris
		yeah.

	iris pats gladys on the shoulder.

				female mourner #1
		may i have a tissue?

				gladys
		but the show must go on.
			(she faces iris)
		i gotta get a hold of ted and ask him 
		if we can use that barn light as a 
		spot again.  so you watch the jell-o 
		salad, okay?

				iris
		all right.  okay.
