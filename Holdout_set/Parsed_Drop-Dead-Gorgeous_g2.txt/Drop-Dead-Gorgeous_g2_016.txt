	ext. mall of america

	in the vast, already full parking lot, we see gladys 
	leeman's station wagon searching for a parking spot.

				iris
		oh, there's a parking space over 
		there.  oh, no, that's just a compact.  
		sorry.

				gladys
		you'd think they'd build the parking 
		lot of america to go with the mall of 
		america!

	gladys pulls into a handicapped spot.  servettes and 
	camera stand outside the car.  iris points at the sign.

				iris
		it's a two-hundred dollar fine!

				gladys
		i said i'd move if a cripple came.  
		let's just run in the store and pick 
		out some outfits.

				iris
		all right, let's go.
