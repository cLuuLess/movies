	int. hospital - hallway - night

	loretta and amber face off.

				loretta
		you're what?!

				amber
		i-i'm quittin' the pageant.

				loretta
		i heard you, i was just tryin' to 
		scare you into changin' your mind.  oh 
		for chrissakes, amber, the woman clung 
		to your tap shoes while flyin' through 
		the air like a goddamn lawn dart!

				amber
		oh god, i'm dead...

	a candy striper approaches them.

				candy striper
		hey, lil' miss sad-pants and her 
		friend serious sally, how kbout some 
		nice cool mints to turn those frowns 
		upside-down. "s."

				loretta
			(to candy striper)
		d'ya think a nice cool mint'd help if 
		i shoved your head up your ass?

	fear sweeps over the candy striper - she bolts down the 
	hall!  loretta puts an arm around amber and starts to 
	walk down the opposite direction.

				amber
		so, what do i say?

				loretta
		simple.  just say, "mom, i know you 
		sacrificed everything - relationships, 
		dreams - your tummy, ass and thighs - 
		all to bring me into this world.  all 
		so i could have tap lessons and be in 
		the pageant - the same one you were 
		in.  but, y'know what?  i'm quittin'."  
		there.  easy as pie.

				amber
		oh my god.  i'm so dead...

				loretta
		yeah, you betcha...
