	white letters on black: "state finals"

	we look up at the towering howard johnsons and see a huge 
	banner which reads: "welcome american teen princess, 
	fried clam platter $9.99." suddenly, a 747, not more than 
	thirty feet above the hotel, flies over - the sound is 
	deafening.

				amber

				loretta
		i got it!  yeah, why don't ya take a 
 
	mr. larson unloads amber's luggage from the hearse.  
	loretta leans against it, arm around amber, smoking and 
	occasionally flipping off people who stop to stare at 
	this unusual sight.

				amber

				loretta

				amber
