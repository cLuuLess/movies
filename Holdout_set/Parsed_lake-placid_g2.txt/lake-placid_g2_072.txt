     ext. campsite - twenty minutes later

     jack is nearly manhandling hector, pulling him by the elbow
     towards his tent.  kelly and keough are there too.

                         jack
                    (livid)
               this time, i'm gonna kick your
               ass.

                         hector
               bastard bit my chopper.

                         jack
               hey!!

     jack simply grabs his arm and squeezes a pressure point.  hector
     yelps in pain.

                         jack (cont'd)
               you wanna kill yourself, that it,
               you looking to commit some kind of
               divine suicide?

                         kelly
               alright, jack!

                         jack
               no!
                    (back to hector)
               you might think they're godly, you
               might get some spiritual lift
               backstrokin' with dragons but you
               just put a deputy at risk and--

                         hector
                    (flaring)
               let's not overlook he didn't eat
               me, maybe--

                         jack
               'cause he just ate a cow, you
               stupid--

                         kelly
               jack!

                         hector
               i'm a civilian!  you don't have any
               authority--

                         keough
               i can arrest you!!

                         hector
               then do it!!

                         keough
               you probably do want to be killed
               by it, that was you trying to meet
               your maker.

                         hector
               so profound and fat.

     hector, feelings hurt, stomps off again.  kelly looks at jack.
     then kelly follows hector.
