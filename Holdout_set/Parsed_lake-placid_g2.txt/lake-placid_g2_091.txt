     ext. beach - continuous

     suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow, snapping
     off the cable.

                         jack
               shit!!

     and down comes to the chopper, hector cannot control it.  it
     crashes into the lake.

                         kelly
               hector!!

                         jack
                    (to keough)
               take him.

                         keough
               i can't.  i'll get hector!!

                         jack
               where is he?!

                         kelly
               we gotta get to hector!!

                         jack
                    (to the driver)
               back us in a little, we need to get
               a shot!

     hector pops his head out of the overturned chopper.  he looks
     around.

                         hector
               where is he?

                         jack
                    (to the deputies)
               tranq guns down, rifles up!

     the men switch guns, under--

                         jack (cont'd)
                    (yelling to hector)
               do not go in that water!
                    (to the driver)
               back us in!!

     as the pick-up backs closer to the shore--

                         jack (cont'd)
                    (to keough)
               if you get a safe shot...

                         keough
               i'll take it!

                         jack
               hector.  do not move.

     the water is calm again.  a beat.

                         jack (cont'd)
                    (to gare)
               you see anything?

                         gare
                    (looking through binocs)
               nothing.  maybe he swam out.

     upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging
     the truck.  screams.

                         jack
               go!!  drive!!

     the pick-up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing keough off
     balance.  the croc heads back for the water as keough regains
     his balance.

                         jack (cont'd)
               take him!!

     and keough blasts.  it detonates the ground near the croc
     causing him to surge airborne into the water.  and he goes
     under.  silence.  a beat.

                         kelly
               did you get him?

                         keough
               i don't know.
                    (to the driver)
               back the truck--

                         all
               no!!!

                         jack
               hector, you see anything?

     angle hector

     on the pontoon of his chopper.  he's looking about, studying the
     water.

                         hector
               no!

                         keough
                    (sarcastic)
               i just have this feeling
               everything's totally safe.

                         hector
                    (yelling)
               i see blood.  maybe you got him,
               hank.

     and as hector looks further.  behind him... up surfaces the
     crocodile in all his stealth.  his head is two feet from hector
     and nobody knows it.  least of all hector.

                         hector (cont'd)
               i can't see him, but this is
               definitely blood.  maybe you got
               him.

     and as he turns back, he sees it.  the croc comes up as hector
     screams, jumps off.  screams.  keough leaps off the truck and
     charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give
     hector some cover.

     hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  he
     climbs in.

                         keough
               where is he?!

                         hector
               i don't know!

     no sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  as he springs
     toward the open chopper cabin, hector, leaps out on the other
     side.  the croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin
     and he becomes wedged.  the crocodile is stuck, he protrudes
     right through the chopper.  he's not completely immobilized but
     wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.

                         keough
               hector!!

     but now jack has joined, rifle in hand.  hector surfaces again,
     swimming for shore.  jack runs to help him onto land.

                         keough (cont'd)
                    (taking aim)
               alright.  game over.

     but the croc looks feeble now.  he lets out this moan of death.
     and even keough hesitates to pull the trigger.

                         keough (cont'd)
                    (to kelly)
               should i?

                         kelly
               wait.

     resume

     the croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach.
     but there's no rage in his behavior now.  he seems desperate.
     he's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two
     ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.

                         kelly
               i think the drugs are kicking in.

     breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to
     free himself from the mangled wreckage.  as unbelievable as that
     cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even
     more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  a thirty foot
     exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  and he
     just cannot go on anymore.

     kelly, hector, jack, keough, stare back.  they approach with
     caution.  they all stare at the tired crocodile.

     angle the croc

     he's now looking back.  bleeding, gasping... beaten.  in his
     eyes... we can see it.  the beast is beaten.

     angle the principles

     there's no triumph.  in their eyes... sadness.

                         jack
               i don't think we really want to
               wait for him to catch his breath.

     it continues to breathe heavily.

                         kelly
               he's through fighting.  look at
               him.

                         jack
               i don't care.  hank.  end it.

     keough raises his cannon.

                         hector
               no.  look.  he's got nothing left.

                         jack
               yeah and every time we think
               there's no more danger--

     upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the
     water, seizing hector.  screams.  it death rolls hector, flings
     him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.
     keough blasts his avenger.  a direct hit.

     it takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing
     into the air.  it splashes down, the first head not to hit
     kelly.

     they all then go for hector, pulling him to shore.  he's
     bleeding.

                         hector
               i'm okay.

                         kelly
               you're not okay, your leg's a mess.

                         jack
               get him onto shore.

                         kelly
               he heeds a tourniquet.

     keough quickly peels off his shirt.  gives it to kelly, who goes
     to work.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               you're gonna be okay.

                         hector
               guess i finally got bit.

                         kelly
               yeah, you got bit.  i'm gonna fix
               it.

     a sudden roar.  kelly screams as jack and keough wheel to see...
     the big croc.  maybe his final roar, he looks weak.  gasping in
     the crashed chopper.  jack and keough approach.

                         keough
                    (quietly; re the big croc)
               he's done.  he's dying.

                         jack
               don't count on it.
                    (then)
               we better take him out.

     but something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at
     them... nobody wants wants to take him out.

     angle the croc

     looking back at them.  he knows he's in their hands now.  he
     knows.

     angle the humans

     a beat.

                         hector
                    (quiet)
               flax him under his tail.  two
               hundred cc's.  under the tail,
               that'll put him to sleep.

     upon which we hear the sound of trucks.  florida fish and game,
     u.s. wildlife, arriving on the scene.

                         jack
               thank god.

     officer colson, florida fish and game, emerges, approaches.
     stares with utter disbelief.

                         kelly
               we need to get it some medical
               help.
                    (re hector)
               and him too.

     by now the florida army has moved in.  they all stare with the
     same suspended disbelief.

                         keough
                    (explaining)
               we trapped him with our chopper.

                                             dissolve to:
