     ext. beach - night

     kelly is testing a machine that sends out little squeaky sounds,
     as jack approaches.  he stops.  takes a second to... well,
     admire her.  she's an attractive woman.  he then approaches.

                         jack
               baby crocs?

                         kelly
               adult males will charge hatchlings.
               if there's one out there...

                         jack
               if one could be out there... why
               does fish and game tell me it's
               impossible?

                         kelly
               because they just consult their
               little indigenous charts.

     a beat, as she tends to her work.

                         jack
               listen... if you really do know
               crocs, you should know how stealth
               like they are.  i wouldn't be
               standing a foot from the water.

     she looks.

                         jack (cont'd)
               he could be right there and you
               wouldn't see him.

                         kelly
                    (still looking at the
                     water)
               i'd be able to see something.

     upon which, jack tosses a rock over her shoulder.  as it makes
     a splash, she screams and practically jumps into his arms.
     then:

                         kelly (cont'd)
                    (realizing)
               oh that's funny.  that was real
               funny.

     and she heads off.  off jack, we:

                                             cut to:
