                         jack
                    (into walkie-talkie; now
                     adrenalized)
               where?  where?

                         hector (o.s.)
                    (through walkie talkie)
               thirty meters or so.  moving slow,
               but straight toward elsie.

                         jack
               can you confirm visually or just
               radar?

                         hector (o.s.)
                    (through walkie talkie)
               radar, he's underwater.  but he's
               definitely coming.

                         jack
               okay.  lead him in.
                    (to the others; barking)
               okay, everybody up on the trucks.
               we aim for the stomach or side...
               there's little chance the darts
               will pierce his hide.  everybody up
               on the trucks.

     they move into position.
