     ext. lake - day

     next to him is sheriff hank keough, paunch, disposition of an
     untipped waiter.

                         keough
               ask me, what an animal does in the
               wild is his own business so long as
               he doesn't do it to man.  i think
               mark twain said that.

                         walt
                    (dry)
               i think he didn't.  but since
               you've said it, i guess we're
               covered.

     keough holds a stare.  walt drops overboard.  keough pulls a
     twinkie from his pocket.  begins to unwrap.
