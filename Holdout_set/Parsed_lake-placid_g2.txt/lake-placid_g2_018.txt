     ext. indigo maine - day

     it's a small, almost tiny town; general store, post office, fire
     station.  kelly and keough are in front of the general store
     loading supplies into a van, across the street in front of the
     sheriff's department.

                         keough
               nobody lives within twenty-five
               miles, 'cept some old couple who
               live right on the lake.  teenagers
               trek in every once in a while, none
               have disappeared, and none have
               spotted anything unusual.

                         kelly
               you talk to the married couple?

                         keough
               not yet.

                         kelly
               what kind of backup do we have?

                         keough
               we?

     that strikes a nerve.

                         kelly
                    (defensive)
               what?

                         keough
               sorry.  i'm just a little unclear
               as to why the museum of natural
               history would send somebody here.

                         kelly
               you have a thing against museums?

                         keough
               i got nothing against--

                         kelly
               ever even been in one?

     he stares back.  then picks up a huge cannon-like gun.  as he
     loads it--

                         kelly
               what is that?

                         keough
               lightweight forward area air device
               unit.  whatever's out there, one
               shot with this and he's dead.

                         kelly
                    (incredulous)
               and you stock these things for
               what, to fend off russia?

     a beat.

                         keough
               you're sort of a rude person.

                         kelly
               it's just that--

     suddenly, like a shot, kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a
     white fog from a can of yard guard.  keough holds a look at her.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               mosquitos.  i have a thing about
               mosquitos.

     upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked "maine
     fish and game".  jack wells emerges, kelly's eyes scan him like
     radar.

                         jack
               we set?

                         keough
               ready.
                    (re kelly; dry)
               a museum in new york sent us some
               additional back up.

     kelly shoots keough a look.  then:

                         kelly
               kelly scott.

                         jack
               jack wells.  a museum sent you?

                         kelly
               are we all museum bigots in maine?

     jack holds a look, decides to let that pass.

                         jack
               did you make anything of the tooth?

                         kelly
               yes, it did seem prehistoric but
               i'm sure he just carried the thing
               for luck.  not that it worked,
               obviously.  it probably somehow got
               lodged into his body.

     jack holds another look.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               why are you staring at me?
                    (to keough)
               do i have a smudge on my face, it
               would be so you not to have told
               me.

     keough also lets that pass.

                         keough
                    (to jack)
               i'm ready when you are.

                         jack
               let's go.

     as they start out, kelly grabs jack by the arm.

                         kelly
               excuse me.  one other thing, it's
               a small point, but... i have a
               thing about being humored, and i'm
               feeling humored, more by him, but
               you seemed quick to join in.

                         jack
               ma'am, your first impression isn't
               going well.

     as janine post, sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up.

                         janine
               excuse me?  is it true you're going
               to look for some kind of monster in
               black lake?

                         keough
               we're just going to investigate an
               accident.  there's no monster.

                         janine
               we heard a man got bit in half.

                         keough
               there was an accident, that's all.
               nothing to worry about.

     and janine goes into the store.  the men just watch her go.
     sixteen going on twenty, nubile.  kelly just looks at the men,
     gaping at the girl.

                         kelly
               please.

                                             cut to:
