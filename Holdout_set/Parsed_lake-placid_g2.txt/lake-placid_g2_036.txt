                         kelly
               he may be a kook but he's also been
               all over the world with them.  he
               even swam in the grimetti with
               killer niles all around him, he
               never got nipped.

                         keough
               and that's why he thinks they're
               godly?

                         kelly
               he said he knew it when he looked
               into their eyes.

                         keough
                    (simple)
               you like jack?

                         kelly
                    (thrown)
               what?  i don't even know the guy.

                         keough
               hector thinks you like him.

                         kelly
               well hector's a giant cracker.

                         keough
               you think jack's handsome?

                         kelly
               what is this?

                         keough
               i'm just curious.  i can never tell
               what women think is handsome.  is
               he handsome?

                         kelly
               well.  he's probably rugged
               handsome i guess.  yeah.

     a beat.

                         keough
