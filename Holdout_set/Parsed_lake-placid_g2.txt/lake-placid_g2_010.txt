     int. movie theater - day

     we're watching an old classic creature feature.  find kelly
     alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense... watching the movie.
     as the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the
     popcorn bag and her mouth.

     angle the screen

     the monster pursues its human victim.

     angle kelly

     fear on her face.

     angle the screen

     the monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey.

     angle kelly

     as she screams with fear and delight.  her scream is only
     partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers.

     after a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again.  wearing
     gullibility, vulnerability all over her face.  then from behind
     a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with
     the most blood-curdling scream of all.

     all the moviegoers turn to see... as will we:

     myra okubo

     thirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder.
