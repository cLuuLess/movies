     ext. lake - much later

     the lake is still, the campfire is out, the tents are quiet.
     the quiet sounds of night.  crickets.  a loon.  an owl.  a
     courageous raccoon looks about, seeing what he can rummage.  by
     the water... a black bear takes a drink.

     angle keough's tent

     he emerges, compelled by a full bladder, wearing only his
     trousers, carrying a revolver.  he walks into the nearby woods.
     he removes from his shorts his bladder's connection to the
     outside world.  proceeds to urinate.  then... he hears
     something.  the sound of rustling leaves.  he stops urinating,
     we hear a half second of movement.  then quiet.  must be his
     imagination.  he resumes his business.

     more rustling, it's not just the sound of dense urine against
     leaves, he stops... something's out there in the darkness.
     quiet.  he starts up for a second, stops quickly, and we hear it
     for sure.  something's rustling towards him.  with his free
     hand, keough pulls out his revolver.  more rustling... keough
     points the gun.  something on the ground is coming toward him.
     he moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness.  the rustling is
     getting louder.  it's almost upon him.  a beat.  closer.
     closer.  then keough peels away a bush revealing:

     hector

     looking into a gun barrel.  he screams.  keough screams.  then--

                         hector
               jesus christ!!

                         keough
               what the hell are you doing?!!

                         hector
               what are you doing?!

                         keough
               you're crawling around like a--

                         hector
               i'm laying a spring trap!

                         keough
               a spring trap!

                         hector
               i keep telling you, they can come
               on land, i don't wanna wake up in
               the middle of the night--

                         keough
               i coulda shot you, you--

                         hector
               this could end up saving your life,--

            hector (cont'd)                  keough
       you'll be glad you didn't    hey look, i'm sure you
       shoot me then, you'll be     finished first in your
       tongue massaging my          class but i think you need
       hemorrhoids, just before     to be retired to the big rubber
       running off to get your      room, where you can play with
       sister pregnant, who you     soft stuffed reptiles.
       probably already call mom.

     and now all the others, awakened, are charging.

                         kelly
                    (arriving)
               hey!  what is going on?

                   hector                    keough
       this man takes a pistol     he's crawling around--
       to pee!

                         keough (cont'd)
                    (escalating)
               this is an official investigation,
               and this cuckoo bird is a civilian.
               i don't care how much money he's
               got, he's a total mental.

     and hector storms off.  a beat.

                         kelly
               you hurt his feelings.  i think you
               should go apologize.

                         keough
               apologize?

                   kelly                   keough (cont'd)
       we're a team here.  it     he's a fruitcake!
       won't kill you to get
       along.

                         kelly (cont'd)
               look.  the thing about hector... he
               takes this crocodile business
               very...
                    (how to say it)
               he thinks they're godly.

     a beat.

                         jack
               he thinks they're what?

                         kelly
               in his defense, every primitive
               culture known to man deified them.
               he's a mythology professor, he
               thinks crocs are divine conduits.

                         keough
               is this 'spose to make me take him
               more serious?

                         kelly
               it's to make you understand him,
               with understanding comes tolerance.
               too bad they don't put proverbs in
               twinkies, my load would be lighter.

                         keough
                    (befuddled)
               why does everybody insult my
               intelligence, i have intelligence,
               intelligent people eat twinkies.

                         kelly
               i'm sorry.

     keough shoots a look to jack.

                         jack
               let's just all get some sleep.

     and keough heads off, under--

                         keough
               i'm an intelligent person.

     upon which, he disappears from earth.  he's stepped into one of
     hector's pit traps.  a beat.

                         keough (o.s.)
                    (calmly)
               i shall kill him.

                                             dissolve to:
