     ext. shore - (different part of the lake) - sunrise

     kelly, jack, keough, and stevens searching for tracks along the
     wooded shoreline, staying a good six feet from the actual shore.
     their senses are very heightened.  keough has his cannon gun.

                         jack
               get back from the shore.  we know
               how fast he can leap out.

                         keough
               we shouldn't even really be doing
               this.

                         jack
               they won't be here till at least
               noon.  we got a few hours to kill.

                         keough
               so does he.

                         kelly
                    (obsessing)
               i'm gonna get ticks.  i know it.
               they're drawn to me.  i got a thing
               about ticks.

                         jack
                    (quickly)
               ssssh!

                         kelly
               what?

                         jack
               i heard something.

     he's staring at a brush thicket.  after a beat, we hear a slight
     rustle.  the guns go up quickly.  a beat.  nothing.  jack bends
     down, picks up a stone.  tosses it into the thicket.  and out it
     charges.  kelly screams, they're all about to fire before they
     realize it's only a beaver.  it scurries into the water.

                         kelly
                    (trying to gather herself)
               shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

                         keough
                    (suddenly)
               look.

     angle a giant paw print

     embedded in the mud.  it must be two feet in diameter.

     resume

                         jack
                    (to keough)
               guard the water.

     kelly and jack go quickly to examine the print.

                         jack (cont'd)
               that's pretty big.
