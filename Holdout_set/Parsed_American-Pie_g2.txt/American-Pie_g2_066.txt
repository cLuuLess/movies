     int. east great falls high - little auditorium - later

     oz and heather are singing with the group, at opposite
     ends of the room.  it's a pop, contemporary arrangement
     of "how sweet it is."  it sounds jazzy, cool.

     oz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him.  he
     sings along, distant.  heather, almost defiantly, sings
     clearer and better than ever.  oz watches her, though she
     never looks his way.  at the bride of the song, heather
     breaks into a solo.  she sings beautifully.  oz is
     hooked.

     the choir teacher halts the song.

                         choir teacher
               okay, heather, that was good, but i
               want to thicken up that solo.
               michigan state is this saturday, and i
               want that part to smoke.

                         heather
               i know, my timing's off.

                         choir teacher
               a little, but i think it'll work
               better as a duet.  with a tenor part.

                         oz
                   (interrupting)
               i'll do it.

     a beat as the choir teacher is impressed and heather
     looks indifferent.

                         oz (cont'd)
               i'll do it.

                         choir teacher
               okay then.  the rest of you okay with
               that?

     the rest of the choir agrees, as heather looks to oz with
     skepticism.

                         choir teacher (cont'd)
               great.  see you tomorrow.

     the group starts packing up.

                         heather
                   (annoyed)
               why are you doing this?

                         oz
               because i want to.

                         heather
               yeah?  well you can't fake your way
               through this.  you better practice.

     she leaves.
