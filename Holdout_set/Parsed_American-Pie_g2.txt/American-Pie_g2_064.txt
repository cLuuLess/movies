                         oz
               okay, explain.

                         kevin
               i can't, i have no idea how he's doing
               it.  and that leaves you trailing,
               jim.  you gotta get your act together.

                         jim
                   (a little aggravated)
               yeah, i know.  i'm working on it.

     jim turns around -- to find nadia is standing right in
     front of him.  jim says nothing.  stuck.  staring.  oz
     elbows him.  jim gives a startled grunt.

                         nadia
               you are very good in the world history
               class, yes?

                         jim
                   (gulps)
               me?

     jim looks over to kevin and oz, who excitedly give him
     encouraging looks and gestures.

                         jim (cont'd)
                   (trying to decipher the guys'
                    signals)
               yes.  no.  yes.

                         nadia
               perhaps you can help me with my
               studies?

     the guys nod, "yes!  yes!"

                         jim
               okay...that would be cool sometime.
                   (sees the guys gesticulating)
               how 'bout tomorrow?

                         nadia
               well, i do have ballet practice.
               perhaps i can come by your house
               afterwards.  i can change clothes at
               your place?

                         jim
                   (barely, overwhelmed)
               i suppose that would be okay.

     nadia walks off.  jim collapses into oz's and kevin's
     arms, like a marathon runner at the end of a race.  they
     pat him heartily in congratulations.
