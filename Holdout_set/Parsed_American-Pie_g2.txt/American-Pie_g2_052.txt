     int. vicky's bedroom - day

     tight on vicky's face, in sexual bliss, writhing.

                         vicky
               oh kevin -- don't stop!

                         kevin
               just a second!

     we see that kevin is kneeling on the floor.  vicky's legs
     are to both sides of him -- he's ducking down, consulting
     the bible, which is hidden beneath the bed.  it's open to
     a page titled "the tongue tornado."

     kevin resumes, out of frame.  vicky goes nuts.

                         vicky (cont'd)
                   (a little too loudly)
               oh, god!

     vicky reaches blindly for a pillow.  she squeezes it over
     her face, moaning into it.

                         vicky (cont'd)
               moly shmmmt!  fmmkkkk!

     noticing that vicky now can't see him, kevin cautiously
     pulls out the bible from under the bed.  sets it next to
     her.  he constantly refers from the book to vicky, and
     back again.
