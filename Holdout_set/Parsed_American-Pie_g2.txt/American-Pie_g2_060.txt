     int. jim's house - hallway - night

     jim's door opens...he winces...reverse to see jim's dad
     looking at the family portrait of jim's family in the
     hallway outside jim's room, his back turned to jim's
     door.

                         jim
               hey, dad.  did you knock?

     jim's dad continues to study the picture.  a beat.  then
     he turns around, like he just realized the door was open.

                         jim's dad
               oh, jim!  i'm looking at the ol'
               family portrait, here.  yep.  it's a
               good one.

     jim can only shrugs in response.  he goes into the hall
     and looks at the portrait.  a beat.

                         jim's dad (cont'd)
               son, i wanted to talk to you about
               what i think you were trying to do the
               other day.

     jim's face drops, seeing his death unfold.

                         jim's dad (cont'd)
                   (continuing with his prepared
                    speech)
               now, you may have tried it in the
               shower, or maybe in bed at night, and
               not even known what you were doing.
               or perhaps you've heard your friends
               talking about it in the locker room.

     jim's eyes dart about, looking for a place to hide.

                         jim
               dad, please stop.  please.  i'm sure i
               know what you're talking about.

                         jim's dad
               sure you know, son, but i think you've
               been having a little problem with it.
               it's okay, though.  what you're doing
               is perfectly normal.  it's like
               practice.  like when you play tennis
               against a wall.  some day, there'll be
               a partner returning the ball.
                   (a beat)
               you do want a partner, don't you son?

                         jim
                   (through clenched teeth)
               yes.

                         jim's dad
               that's great.  now remember, it's okay
               to play with yourself.  or, as i
               always called it --
                   (elbows jim)
               "stroke the salami!"
                   (chuckles)
               ho-ho, jim.  there's nothing to be
               ashamed of.  hell, i'm fifty-two, and
               i still enjoy masturbating.  uncle
               mort masturbates.  we all masturbate.

     nauseated and entirely disoriented, jim tries to stumble
     back into his room.  he smacks the doorframe.  keeps
     going, slamming the door behind him.  a beat.

                         jim's dad (cont'd)
               poor guy thought he was the only one.
