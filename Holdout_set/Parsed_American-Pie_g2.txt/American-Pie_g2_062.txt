     ext. football field - day

     after the game.  oz sees heather waiting for him on the
     sidelines.  he's about to run over when coach marshall
     snags him --

                         coach marshall
               good work, ostreicher.

                         oz
               thanks coach.

                         coach marshall
               you're a killer, ozzy!

                         oz
                   (trying to get away)
               -- thanks, coach --

     follow with oz as he trots over to heather, covered in
     mud.

                           oz
               hey, what're you doing here?

                         heather
               just enjoying my exhilarating first
               lacrosse experience.  you like,
               "kicked butt."

     a clod of mud falls from oz's uniform onto heather's
     skirt.

                         oz
                   (brushing it off her skirt)
               whoops, excuse me...

     oz wipes the mud from his hands.  a beat.  heather has
     something to say that's not quite coming out.

                         heather
               um...chris --

                         oz
               you can call me oz.

                         heather
               do i have to?

                         oz
               you can call me ostreicher.

                         heather
               what's your middle name?

                         oz
               forget it.

                         heather
               come on!  i won't tell.

                         oz
               neither will i.

                         heather
               okay.
                   (pause)
               so i had this...thought, and...this
               may seem like it's out of left field,
               and i don't know if you can, but since
               i'm not going with anyone --

     before she can finish, stifler runs up, sweaty and
     excited.

                         stifler
               hah!  central sucks!
                   (noticing heather)
               choir chick?  what the hell are you
               doing here?

                         heather
               well, i uh, i was --
                   (decides to stand her ground)
               i was asking chris to prom.
                   (turns to oz)
               so do you wanna go?

     oz is surprised at her directness.  impressed.

                         oz
               yeah!

                         stifler
               well, just don't expect oz to pay for
               the limo.

                         oz
               stifler, fuck --
                   (noticing heather, "sensitive")
               ...man, you don't have to be so
               insensitive.

     a beat.

                         stifler
               what??
                   (he dismisses it)
               whatever -- look uh, don't forget --
               my cottage after prom.  on lake
               michigan.

     stifler joins some other lacrosse buddies.

                         oz
               alright, cool.  i gotta hit the
               showers, but...i think this'll be
               really good.

                         heather
               yeah, me too, okay, cool.

     they share a smile.  then heather walks off towards her
     car.  oz trots off to stifler and the other lacrosse
     guys.

                         stifler
               my man oz, working it with the choir
               babes?

                         lacrosse buddies
                   (cheering, slapping him)
               yeah, go oz! etc.

     oz laughs, embarrassed.

                         oz
                   (pandering to them)
               hey, you know, what can i say, i dig
               those cute little sweaters she wears.

                         stifler
               i'll bet you do, you little horndog,
               she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies,
               right?

     stifler goes into what can only be described as the spank-
     me-and-fuck-me-like-a-whore-dance.

                         stifler (cont'd)
               yeah!  sing for me!  yes!

     the other guys laugh.  oz joins in, laughing in spite of
     himself.  they all high-five.

     and from the other side of the field, we see heather
     peering over at them.  hardly believing it as oz joins in
     the laughter.
