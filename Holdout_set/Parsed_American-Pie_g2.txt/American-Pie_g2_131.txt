     int. vicky's bedroom - day

     vicky is doing calculus homework, as kevin looks on,
     rubbing her shoulders.

                         kevin
               you're not doing the extra credit
               problems.

                         vicky
               no, i'm not.  i'm writing a sequence
               of random numbers that look like i'm
               doing the extra credit problems.  mr.
               bender doesn't bother to check
               homework past april.

                         kevin
               that's my trick!

                         vicky
               it's everyone's trick, kevin.
                   (she turns to him)
               but i did pick it up from you.

     she gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with
     her work.  kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious.

                         kevin
               we've come a long way since
               homecoming.

                         vicky
                   (playful)
               yeah, we have.  you corrupted my four-
               point into a three-nine-five.

                         kevin
               indeed i did.  but, our relationship.
               it's progressed a lot.  it's time for
               us to...express ourselves in new ways.

     vicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk,
     facing him.  her mood has shifted, more romantic.

                         vicky
               like how?

                         kevin
               well, i feel that...things are getting
               to that point in a relationship.
               when two people share...a special
               moment between them.

                         vicky
               i think you're so right, kevin.

                         kevin
                   (pause)
               you want to do it?

                         vicky
               yes --

     she takes his hand.  readies herself, and declares.

                         vicky (cont'd)
               i love you.

     kevin falters.  this is definitely not what he was
     expecting.  he's caught.  trying to formulate a response.

                         vicky (cont'd)
               kevin?  do you not love me?

                         kevin
               no, i don't not love you.  i like, i
               know that we've definitely got
               something between us.  something good.
               something special.

                         vicky
               but you don't love me.

                         kevin
               i didn't say that.  i mean, love, it's
               like a term that gets thrown around.
               people say things, they get married,
               have kids, and then what?  it's like
               they call it off, going "i was wrong."

     a beat.  vicky seems to know where he's coming from.

                         vicky
               kevin...you're not your dad.  the two
               of us, we're not your parents.

                         kevin
               i know, vick.  i'm just not ready yet,
               okay?

                         vicky
               okay.
