     ext. east great falls high - courtyard, a bench - later

     heather is studying outside.  oz stands before her,
     breathless, his hair still wet.

                         oz
               ...i've got this lacrosse game.  it's
               really important, it's our last game.
               and you know, central almost beat us
               last time, so i really want to kick
               their ass, and it's like cool because
               we're gonna get to play at state,
               which means that after the game i
               might be able to stop by...

                         heather
                   (pause)
               you can't sing at the competition.

                         oz
               i'm sorry, i totally spaced.  i
               just...i didn't realize it...

                         heather
                   (upset but trying to be cool)
               ...it's okay, you should do whatever
               makes you happy.

                         oz
               alright...yeah...thanks for
               understanding.
                   (a beat)
               so i guess...i'll see you later.

     an uncomfortable moment.  oz walks off.  heather looks
     let down.
