     int. east great falls high - main hallway - day

     jim and oz, now joined by kevin, walk down the hall.  oz
     bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker, catching it
     again.  kevin speaks a little distantly, unnerved.

                         kevin
               then she said -- she loves me.

                         oz
               oh shit dude, the l-word!

                         jim
               and you said...

                         kevin
               nothing, i just hugged her back.

                         jim
               you think she was serious?

                         kevin
               i couldn't tell -- she could've meant
               like, "i love you grandma" or "i love
               you vanderbilt."

                         oz
               just don't bring it up, hang low,
               maybe she won't mention it again.
