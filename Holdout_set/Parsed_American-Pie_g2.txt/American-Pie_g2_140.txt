     int. east great falls high - guy's showers/locker room - day

     toweled guys exit the steamy showers, doing a macho great
     falls lacrosse chant.  they exit frame, and we remain on
     the showers, to hear --

                         oz
                   (singing happily)
               ...i needed the shelter of someone's
               arms...there you were -- woo-hoo-
               hoo...

     he exits in a towel and goes to his locker, next to
     stifler.

                         oz (cont'd)
                   (still singing)
               ...i needed someone to understand my
               ups and my downs, oh baby there you
               were...

     stifler is staring at oz, horrified.

                         stifler
               oh my fucking god.  you're gay.

                         oz
                   (cheery)
               come on, you know the words, sing
               along.

                         stifler
               no thanks, you've been singing that
               shit all week.  if you try that at msu
               this saturday, i'm pretending i don't
               know you.

     oz stops.

                         oz
               our last game is this saturday.

                         stifler
               no shit.
