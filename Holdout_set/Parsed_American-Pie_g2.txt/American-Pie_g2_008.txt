     int. east great falls - senior lockers - day

     kevin, jim, and oz are still walking down the hall.
     paul finch, preppy, eccentric, is sitting on a bench.

                         jim
               there's our man.

                         kevin
               finch, you got the latin homework?

                         finch
               non habeo.  canis meus id comedit.

     the guys keep staring.  a beat.

                         kevin
               whatever.

     someone is hollering down the hall.  running towards oz
     is steve stifler -- very clean-cut and preppy, he's a
     maniac, a jackass, much worse than oz.  not really part
     of the group.

                         stifler
                   (yelling)
               nova!!

                         oz
               stifler!!

     stifler runs full-force into oz, grabbing him in a bear
     hug.

                         stifler
               you coming to party tonight,
               ostreicher, ya fuckface?

                         oz
               depends if my date wants to stop by.

                         stifler
               that junior chick?

                         oz
               nah, gave her the heisman.  i'm
               working on something new.

                         stifler
               yeah right.  i got an idea for
               something new.  how 'bout you guys
               actually locate your dicks, remove the
               shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.

                         oz
               dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a
               college chick!

                         stifler
               bullshit.  from where?

                         oz
               she works part-time at my dad's store.

                         stifler
               hah!  yeah, oz, i bet it's more like
               your dad works at her store.

                         oz
               dude, he does not.

                         kevin
               really, stifler.  he's the manager.

     oz gives a little nod, avoiding the issue.

                         stifler
               hey, man, i'm not making fun.  i'm
               fuckin' impressed.  i mean, "footlong
               or six-inch, white or wheat," that's
               some serious shit to master.

     oz musters a little laugh.

                         kevin
                   (half-joking)
               stifler, you're such an asshole.

                         stifler
               meyers, what's the deal with you and
               vicky, anyway?  you've been going out
               since homecoming and all she'll do is
               blow you?  shit, i'd drop her like a
               steaming turd.

                         finch
               do you commonly grasp warm pieces of
               stool?

                         stifler
                   (momentarily puzzled)
               i do when i'm throwing them at your
               mom, you damn freak.
                   (then)
               alright then, see you guys tonight.
               i'll look for you in the no fucking
               section.

     the guys all take this little too seriously to have a
     comeback.  stifler just laughs obnoxiously as he walks
     off.
