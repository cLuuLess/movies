     int. east great falls high - classroom - day

     english class.  the teacher is wrapping up a lecture.

                         teacher
               so once hal becomes king, he has to
               take on the responsibilities of
               leadership, and turn his back on his
               old, drunken friend, falstaff.  you
               see, hal was going through a rite of
               passage, much like you all are.  make
               the most of the time you've got left
               together.  you'll miss it later.

     jim, kevin, and oz sit in the back of the classroom in
     one corner.

                         oz
               so does your tongue cramp up?

                         kevin
               nah, you get kind of dizzy though.

                         jim
               wow, that's amazing, she's probably
               gonna want to do it soon.

     kevin shrugs as the bell rings.  sherman passes by.

                         sherman
               still questing after the holy grail,
               eh guys?

     he chuckles and exits.  the guys stand up, exiting the
     classroom.

                         jim
               hey, where's finch?

                         kevin
               went home to shit.

                         jim
               i don't get it.  how does a guy like
               that get this sudden reputation?

                         oz
               what reputation?

                         kevin
               observe.

     he taps a passing random cute girl on the shoulder.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               excuse me.  do you know who paul
               finch is?

                         random cute girl
               of course!  have you guys seen his
               tattoo?

                         kevin
               ...yes?

                         random cute girl
               is it cool?  i heard it was like an
               eagle, blazing in fire and stuff.

                         jim
                   (nods, loving it)
               actually, it's an eagle and this big
               python.

                         random cute girl
               really?!

                         jim
               yeah, see it's on his stomach, here,
               and the eagle -- the eagle is actually
               grasping the python in its talons, so
               the snake is like his --

                         kevin
                   (interrupting)
               that's good, jim.

                         random cute girl
               woah, no way!  that guy is so cool!

     she hurries off to tell her friends.  the guys exit the
     classroom.
