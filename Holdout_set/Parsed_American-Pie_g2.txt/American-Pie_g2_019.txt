     int. stifler's house - master bedroom - night - moments later

     vicky is buttoning up her shirt.  kevin tentatively sets
     down the beer and buttons his pants.  suddenly the door
     bursts open.  stifler is standing there.  a coat hanger
     sticks out of the doorknob.

                         stifler
               suck me, beautiful!

                         kevin
               god dammit, stifler!

                         stifler
               check-out time!  please vacate the
               room.

                         vicky
               stifler, you're such a jerk.

     she runs out, grabbing her clothes.  kevin runs after
     her.

                         kevin
               vicky, wait!

     stifler enters the bedroom, laughing, pulling a sophomore
     chick behind him.  he closes the door.

                         sophomore chick
               god, i can't believe there are so many
               cool people at this party.

                         stifler
               yep.

                         sophomore
               and you got a keg, too, wow.
                   (realizing)
               oh, wait, i left my beer downstairs.

     stifler notices kevin's beer sitting on the night table.
     he hands it to her.

                         stifler
               here, babe.

                         sophomore chick
               thanks.

     she's about to take a sip.

                         stifler
                   (gazing into her eyes)
               you're really beautiful.

     thrown off, she sets the beer down.

                         sophomore chick
               really?

                         stifler
               uh huh.

     she's totally enthralled.  nervous, she raises the beer
     again to take a sip.  then stifler moves in.  takes the
     beer from her and sets it down.  starts kissing her.  she
     breaks it off.

                         sophomore chick
               i don't know if i want to be doing
               this.

                         stifler
                   (sighs)
               doing what?

     stifler looks inconvenienced.  he picks up the beer,
     annoyed.

                         sophomore chick
               you know.  if we hook up, tomorrow
               i'll just be some girl you go telling
               all your friends about.

                         stifler
                   (shifty)
               no way.

     avoiding her look, he raises the beer to take a sip.

                         sophomore chick
                   (a little angry)
               steve!  you could at least look at me
               when you say that.

     stifler stops and sighs, the beer inches from his mouth.
     lowers it.  stares her in the eye.

                         stifler
               look...
                   (searching, remembers)
               ...sarah.  i wouldn't go telling
               stories or whatever about you.  i
               promise.

     smiling, he raises the beer...
