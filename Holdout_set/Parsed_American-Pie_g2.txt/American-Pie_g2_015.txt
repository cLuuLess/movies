     int. car - night

     oz is in the passenger seat, making out with the
     aforementioned college chick.  she's attractive and older-
     looking (from a high-school perspective).  they are
     parked near the river that flows through downtown great
     falls.

                         oz
               great evening, isn't it?

                         college chick
               sure.

                         oz
               there's something about the spring
               that's just cool.  like the smell of
               fresh rain or something.

     at this, she snuggles up to him.  oz smiles confidently.

                         oz (cont'd)
               suck me, beautiful.

     the college chick backs off, confounded.

                         college chick
               what did you just say?

                         oz
                   (not so confidently)
               suck me...beautiful?

     the college chick's eyes flutter in disbelief.  she tries
     to keep her cool -- but can barely restrain her laughter.

                         college chick
               what?!

     oz attempts to maintain a suave exterior, but he's just
     had the rug pulled from under him.

                         oz
               uh...you know, my friends call me nova
               -- as in casanova.

                         college chick
               you need some work, buddy!

     she bursts into laughter.  oz is ill.

                         oz
               well...jeez, don't laugh at me.

     seeing oz's defeated expression, she collects herself.

                         college chick
               look, chris.  there are just some
               things you need to learn, that's all.

                         oz
               like what?

     she sees that he's lost.  almost feels sorry for him.

                         college chick
               alright, well...you've got to tone it
               down.  you don't need to go to lookout
               point and spout cheeseball lines to be
               romantic.

                         oz
               ...okay...

                         college chick
               you have to pay attention to a girl.
               be sensitive to her feelings.
               relationships are reciprocal.

                         oz
               i'm not good in math.

     she's trying not to laugh again.

                         college chick
               come on, i'll drop you off at your
               friends'.

     oz couldn't be humiliated any further.
