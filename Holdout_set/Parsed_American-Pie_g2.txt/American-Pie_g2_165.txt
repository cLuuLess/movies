     int. backstage - day

     the vocal jazz group is on their feet, lined up, waiting
     to go onstage.  oz bursts into the room, still in his
     lacrosse gear.

                         vocal jazz guys
               oz -- you're back -- yeah --

                         albert
               -- oh, great.

     oz rushes up to heather.  she's happy but confused.

                         heather
               what about the game?!

                         oz
               i'm not playing.

                         heather
               you're missing the game for us?!

                         oz
               no.  i'm missing the game for you.

     heather melts.  oz pulls her close.  and they kiss.

                         vocal jazz teacher
               okay, okay.  you guys got about a
               minute to go.  spend it warming up,
               not making out.  this ain't the prom
               yet.

     oz and heather share a smile.
