     int. jim's house - kitchen - day

     jim and his dad sit in silence, opposite each other at
     the table.  jim stares into his lap, humiliated.  jim's
     dad is crushed.  you've never seen such disappointment...
     but he's trying to keep his chin up for jim's sake.

     in the middle of the table is the pie.  it's decimated.
     mushed up, ruined...violated.

                         jim's dad
                   (fighting back tears)
               i guess...we'll just tell your
               mother...that we ate it all.
