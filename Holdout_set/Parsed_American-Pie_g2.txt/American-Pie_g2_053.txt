     int. vicky's house - kitchen - day

     vicky's mom is straining some pasta.  on the fridge, we
     see a collage in tribute to vicky -- her senior portrait,
     national honor society certificate, a report card.

                         vicky's mom
                   (yells to vicky's dad)
               hon?  can you tell vick to come on
               down for supper?

     vicky's dad is at the table reading the paper.  he gets
     up with a grunt.
