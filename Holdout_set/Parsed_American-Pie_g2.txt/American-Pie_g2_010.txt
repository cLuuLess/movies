     int. dog days - late afternoon

     a small, nostalgia-themed dive.  despite the theme,
     classic rock plays.  kevin, oz, jim and finch sit at a
     table.  they munch on hot dogs piled high with
     condiments.

                         kevin
               you ever hear of something called the
               bible?

                         oz
               once, in church, dude.

     jim is paging through great falls' equivalent of the la
     weekly.

                         jim
               ooh, here's an easy one:  "attractive
               swf, fun loving and a youthful mind
               seeks outgoing companion."
               okay..."attractive"...ugly.

                         oz
               "fun loving" -- insane.

                         kevin
               unlisted age, plus "youthful mind,"
               equals old.

                         jim
               no, "charming" is old.  "older" is
               really old.  "youthful mind" is dead.

                         finch
               perhaps you should consider actually
               answering an ad.

                         jim
               finch, you can be the one to date a
               nearly-dead insane chick.  eat your
               damn imitation hot dog.

                         finch
                   ("for the hundredth time")
               this is no imitation.  removing the
               hot dog from the ultradog yields a
               better dog.  behold -- ultradog, no
               dog.

     finch displays the cross-section on his hot dog.  it's
     all condiments.  the guys react with rehearsed offense.

                         kevin
                   (checks his watch)
               alright...i'm shooting for a nine
               o'clock eta.  beer in hand by five
               after.

                         jim
               you can crash at stifler's?

                         kevin
               it's all good.
                   (he pulls out some gum)
               breath check.

     he hands out a stick of gum to each guy, automatically
     skipping finch, who pulls out a small, hotel-bottle of
     scope.  gargles with it.  spits it into his drink cup.

                         oz
                   (repulsed)
               dude, i wish you wouldn't do that.

                         kevin
               you got something up your sleeve for
               tonight, finch?

                         finch
               a foolproof plan, my friend.  you
               shall see.

     oz has tuned into the song in the background -- "blinded
     by the light" [the original springsteen version, not the
     manfred mann remake].

                         oz
                   (sings along)
               and little hurly-burly came by in her
               curly-wurly, and asked me if i needed
               i ri-hide --

                         kevin
               how the hell do you know all these
               random songs?

                         oz
               it's early springsteen, dude, this is
               classic.  this was before the cheesy
               remake.

                         jim
               this was remade?  into what?

                         oz
                   (chiming in as the chorus hits)
               bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose
               like a deuce, another runner in the
               night, blinded...

                         kevin
               at least now i know what the hell
               they're saying.

                         jim
               so, does my hair look better --
                   (flips a small lock of hair
                    onto his forehead)
               like this, or...
                   (flips it back up)
               like this?

                         oz
               who cares?

                         jim
               nadia does, that czechoslovakian
               chick, she might be there tonight.
               now, do you think she'd prefer --
                   (flips hair down again)
               cool hip jim...
                   (flips it back up)
               or laid back jim?

                         kevin
               the difference is so phenomenal, i
               can't decide.
