     int. jim's bedroom - day - continuing

     nadia leans over to jim's clock radio.  turns it on.  we
     hear country music.  she flips the dial, and we hear a
     few stations flip by.  then a driving, euro-techno song.

                         nadia
               perfect.

     she turns to jim.

                         jim
               uh...

                         nadia
               move with the music.

                         jim
               um...okay...

     he struts clumsily back and forth.  takes his shirt off.
     swings it in a circle around his head...and lets go of
     it, aiming for the quickcam, where it lands.

                         nadia
               no, no, you must put your whole body
               into it.

                         jim
               nadia, i can't --

                         nadia
               can't what?  do you not want to be
               with me?  i wish to be entertained,
               james.

     jim nods eagerly.  concentrates on the music...as we see
     the shirt slide off the camera.  jim starts writhing to
     the beat.  like a hyperactive chicken.
