     ext. east great falls high - courtyard - later

     finch is sitting on a bench, reading the paper, carefree.
     kevin and jim approach.

                         kevin
               this is your plan, finch?

                         finch
               yep.

     he turns a page.  skims the articles.  a beat.

                         kevin
               this.  right now.

                         finch
               uh-huh.

                         jim
               you're just gonna sit there and drink
               your coffee?

                         finch
               mochaccino.
                   (then)
               actually, in the spirit of the pact, i
               do need to ask for your cooperation in
               one small matter.

                         kevin
               of course, finch.  what?

                         finch
               whatever you hear about me, you agree.

                         kevin
               what are we gonna hear?

                         finch
               you'll see.  gotta go.  sixteen
               minute round trip.

                         jim
               finch, don't you think it's about time
               you learned to take a dump at school?

                         finch
               when was the last time you looked at
               the facilities here?

                         kevin
               fifteen minutes ago.

     finch shudders and walks away.  kevin and jim stand
     there, dumbfounded.  an enthralled girl approaches.

                         enthralled girl
               uh, guys?  was that paul finch?

                         kevin
               yeah.

                         enthralled girl
               you guys have like, seen him in the
               locker room, right?

                         kevin
               yeah.

                         enthralled girl
               is it true that he's really...huge?

                         jim
               i have no idea.  finch showers in a
               bathing suit.

                         kevin
                   (forced)
               no -- it's true.  he is...really...
               big.

                         jim
                   (loving it)
               yeah, enormous.

                         enthralled girl
               woah.  does he have a date for prom
               yet.

                         jim
               definitely not.

                         enthralled girl
               no way!

     she hurries off to a group of girls, sharing the gossip.
     they all seem very interested.

                         kevin
                   (dumbfounded)
               finch hasn't done a damn thing, and
               he's got girls lining up already.
