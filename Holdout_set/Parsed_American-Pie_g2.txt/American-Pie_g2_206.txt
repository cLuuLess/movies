                   (to jim)
               i guess we'll call you two-ply.

                         oz
               yeah.  so you want double condiments
               on that?

                         jim
               no, no that's fine.
                   (then, to kevin)
               so you doing okay?

                         kevin
                   (a wistful smile)
               yeah.

                         finch
               i'll tell you, i've learned one thing:
               women, like wine, get better with age.
                   (a beat)
               of course, i have no frame of
               reference for this comparison.

                         kevin
               so oz, you almost made it, huh?

                         oz
                   (smiles)
               i'll just say that we had a great
               night together.

                         jim
               hang in there, buddy, you'll get
               there.

                         oz
               i know.

                         kevin
               wow.  you two really have something
               going, don't you?

                         oz
               i think we're falling in love.

     they groan.  oz just smiles.

                         kevin
               you know what the coolest thing is?
               this, right now.

     they guys keep eating, uncertain what to say.

                         oz
               it's true.  i mean, after this,
               everything'll be different.

                         jim
               after getting laid?

                         oz
               after high school.

                         kevin
               yeah, but we'll still see each other.

                         oz
               fuck yeah we will.

     a beat.  kevin raises his pepsi.

                         kevin
               to the next step.

                         all
               to the next step.

     they all toast.
