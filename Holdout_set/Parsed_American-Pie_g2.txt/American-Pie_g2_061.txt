     ext. football field - day

     the football field also doubles as the lacrosse field.
     east great falls is battling central.  it's a rough game,
     muddy, brutal.  we see oz grunting and groaning, playing
     very tough.

     on the sidelines, we see heather has shown up.  she's
     watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches oz's
     agility and domination.  oz runs up the field, cradling
     the ball in his stick.  a couple central players try to
     check him.  heather cringes with each impact, and is then
     excited to see oz dodge his opponents.

     finally, oz scores with a triumphant yell.  heather
     cheers with the crowd as the egf players congratulate
     each other.
