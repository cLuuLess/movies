     int. subway - night

     oz is closing up the store.  he looks up to see heather
     at the door.  oz goes and opens it, surprised,
     embarrassed.  the air is awkward between them.

                         heather
               hi...

                         oz
               how did you know i was here?

                         heather
               stifler told me.

                         oz
               you talked to stifler?

                         heather
               well...i needed to find you.  we are
               gonna have to practice that song.

                         oz
               ...okay.  cool then.  i'm um, i'm glad
               you came by.  i mean, really.

     she smiles.  oz lets her in.

                         heather
               so you like, work nights?

     an uncomfortable moment for oz.

                         oz
               uh...my dad's the manager.

                         heather
               really?  cool.  tell him his subs are
               great.

                         oz
               ah, he's always too heavy on the
               vinegar.  if you really want a good
               one, you gotta let me make it.
