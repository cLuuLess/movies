     ext. east great falls high - courtyard - day

     jim is walking through the courtyard, a bit dazed.  a
     couple girls pass by him, giggling.  he trudges
     along...noticing a clique of girls staring at him as he
     passes by...and stoner #1 giving him a peace sign...and
     the computer nerd staring at him like a celebrity......
     jim's pace slows.  he hears a snicker behind him...he
     slows even more, taking very careful steps...as he sees a
     girl doing a really strange dance -- and his eyes pop out
     as he sees that, yes, it's his dance.  he stops.  almost
     everyone is staring at him.  jim pulls his coat up over
     his face and hurries off into the school, like a fugitive
     avoiding the media.  people applaud and laugh.
