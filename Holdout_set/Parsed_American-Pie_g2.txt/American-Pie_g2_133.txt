     int. subway - night - moments later

     oz is behind the counter.  heather walks down the other
     side as oz assembles a sub.

                         oz
               my dad's always here running the
               store, busy and stuff...and i fill in
               once a week so he can get a night off.

                         heather
                   (pause)
               that's nice.

                         oz
                   (shrugs)
               so you're going to michigan?

                         heather
               yeah, well my parents wanted me to go
               to northwestern.  i didn't want to
               write all those extra essays they make
               you do -- i mean, how am i supposed to
               know what my "most emotionally
               significant moment" was?  so when my u
               of m acceptance came in december, i
               said the hell with it.

                         oz
               onions?

                         heather
               what?

                         oz
               you want onions?

                         heather
               oh, yeah.  so what're you gonna major
               in?

                         oz
               well, state's got a good business
               school.  and i can probably walk onto
               the lacrosse team.  green peppers?

                         heather
               yeah.  so wow, you've got it figured
               out.

                         oz
                   (dismissive)
               well, i mean, business is okay, and
               lacrosse is awesome, but what am i
               gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  i
               really have no idea.

                         heather
               oh thank god, i thought i was the only
               one.

                         oz
               well, you're not.  oil and vinegar?

                         heather
               yeah.  you know, people are always
               like, "what're you gonna major in?"
               and i don't know.  and they're like,
               "you'll figure it out."  yeah?  when?

                         oz
               i know.  salt and pepper?

                         heather
               sure.

     oz cuts the sub in half with a flourish and puts it on a
     tray.

                         heather (cont'd)
               so we're gonna be close next year?

                         oz
               you -- oh, you mean -- yeah, east
               lansing and ann arbor.

                         heather
                   (smiles)
               ...yeah.

     a beat...a little uncomfortable, but nice.

                         oz
               wanna swap your chips for cookies?
