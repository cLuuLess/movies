     int. east great falls - classroom - day

     class has just ended, students are filing out of the
     classroom.  a teacher grades papers in the back of the
     room, routinely writing "a, a-, a, a-" on each paper.
     vicky is studying a pull-down map hanging over the
     chalkboard.  kevin comes up next to her.

                         kevin
               hey...

                         vicky
               did you know that it's...450 miles
               from ann arbor to nashville?

                         kevin
               it's like a six or seven hour drive.
               that's easy, i don't mind driving.

     a beat.  kevin looks back over his shoulder to the
     inattentive teacher.  moves closer to vicky.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               about the other day...i've been
               thinking.

                         vicky
               so have i.  and i know you want to
               make things perfect for me.  and i
               understand that you really wouldn't
               tell me that until you were 100%
               comfortable with it.

     vicky looks over to the teacher, who coughs.  she steps
     closer.  kevin, somewhat nervous, takes the bottom of the
     map, fidgeting with it a little.

                         vicky (cont'd)
               and i want to make things perfect for
               you.  you're right, kev, we do have
               something good...and special.

                         kevin
               yeah, we have something great, vick.

                         vicky
               kevin...
                   (very close, whispered)
               i want to have sex with you.

     the map goes flapping upwards.  the teacher looks up.

                         kevin
                   (almost frightened)
               now?!

                         vicky
               no...i know the perfect time...

     she looks to the calendar on the wall...and taps next
     saturday -- "prom."  kevin can't believe it...music up
     for pre-prom montage --
