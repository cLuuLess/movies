     int. east great falls high - main hall near pop machine - day

     vicky is talking with jessica, a friend of hers, getting
     a pop (we're in the midwest now, gang) from the machine.

                         vicky
               vanderbilt's not that far from u of m.

                         jessica
               yeah right.

                         vicky
               what?  we both have cars.

                         jessica
               yeah but, no offense, you're talking
               about a post-high school, long-
               distance relationship, and you and
               kevin haven't even done it yet.

                         vicky
               that's not why we're going out.

                         jessica
               what the hell are you expecting him to
               drive to vanderbilt for?  milk and
               cookies?

                         vicky
               jessica!  he'll drive there for me,
               and i'll drive to ann arbor for him.
               we're going to have sex when he's
               ready and i'm ready.  it's got to be
               completely perfect.  i want the right
               place, the right time, the right
               moment.

                         jessica
               vicky, it's not a space shuttle
               launch, it's sex.  so did you do the
               physics write-up?

                         vicky
                   (offended, a la kevin)
               please.
