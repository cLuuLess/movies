               the girlfriend and you're still
               stranded on third base.

                         kevin
               you know, i've never got that shit.
               what exactly constitutes third base?

               contact, dude.

                         kevin
               then where does a blowjob figure in?

     they ponder this for a moment.

                         oz
               shortstop.  'course, you don't make it
               to third, and you're out.

               so let's say you get there...what's
               uh, third base feel like?

                         kevin
               oh, man, that's kind of sad.

     jim shrugs, embarrassed.

                         oz
               feels like warm apple pie, dude.

                         jim
               apple pie...
                   (then)

     they just look at him.  finch hops on his scooter.

                         finch
               gentlemen, see you at the bacchanalia.

     he meeps his horn and buzzes away.
