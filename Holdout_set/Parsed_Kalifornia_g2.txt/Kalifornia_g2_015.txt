               int. apartment kitchen - few moments later

               the room's crowded with people. there's a lot of noise -- 
               "shop talk," banter. clipped conversations overlap, as we 
               find brian with his friend eric. they are in the midst of 
               making a blender of margaritas.

                                     brian
                         i'm talking about the mind and 
                         culpability of a serial killer. 
                         someone who has no ability to 
                         distinguish between right and wrong 
                         should not be imprisoned, let alone 
                         executed.

               eric dumps in a handful of ice cubes as brian pours in the 
               booze.

                                     eric
                         oh, here we go again. let's just lay 
                         it all at the altar of misfiring 
                         synapses, amok biochemicals and 
                         horrendous childhoods.

                                     brian
                         look, it's a fact, most of these 
                         people suffer from a severe chemical 
                         brain imbalance.
                              (beat)
                         that enough tequila?

                                     eric
                         probably not...

               brian pours in the rest of the bottle.

                                     brian
                              (to eric)
                         the answer is research and treatment 
                         under hospital supervised conditions, 
                         not the electric chair!

               eric looks for triple sec in the cupboards. peter overhears 
               them on his way to the refrigerator.

                                     peter
                         yeah, until it's your mother's head 
                         they find in the refrigerator.

               he pulls open the refrigerator door and grabs two beers. 
               carrie steps up behind brian.

                                     brian
                         executing the killer wouldn't bring 
                         my mother back.

                                     carrie
                         thank god!

               brian turns to see carrie now behind him. she wraps her arms 
               around his neck.

                                     brian
                              (sarcastic to carrie)
                         ha, ha.

                                     eric
                         yeah, but it'd sure make you feel 
                         better, wouldn't it?

                                     brian
                         no, it wouldn't make me feel better.

               peter finds triple sec in the refrigerator.

                                     peter
                         ...looking for this?

               eric takes the triple sec from peter and pours some in the 
               blender. he turns it on. it whines.

                                     carrie
                              (to brian)
                         if i have to listen to one more 
                         "tweed" talk about his dissertation, 
                         i'm going to throw up.

                                     eric
                              (to brian)
                         label it anyway you want, the bottom 
                         line is these people are evil, plain 
                         and simple.

                                     brian
                              (continuing with eric)
                         okay, now you want to talk about 
                         good versus evil? well then let's 
                         start with adam and eve and the snake.

                                     carrie
                         who do i have to blow to get out of 
                         here?

                                     brian
                              (reconsiders)
                         a... i gotta go.
