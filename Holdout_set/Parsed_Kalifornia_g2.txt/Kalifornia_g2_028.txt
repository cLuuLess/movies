               ext. early's trailer

               tires screeching, the car surges toward diebold and the dogs. 
               scared shitless... diebold begins back peddling. confused, 
               the pitbulls bark, then follow suit.

               early laughs as he stalks diebold.

               diebold jumps out of the way of the grand prix just as it 
               pulverizes his portable barbecue.

               early shifts it into drive and barrels out of the drive.

               new angle - diebold

               as soon as the grand prix is out of sight...

                                     diebold
                              (hollering)
                         you sonofabitch! come back here!

               furious, he turns to find adele staring at him from the window 
               of her trailer.

                                     diebold
                         that's it! you tell him... i want 
                         you both the fuck out of here by 
                         sunday or i'm gonna call the police.

               adele starts laughing, she tries to hide it with her hand.

                                     diebold
                         ...you won't be laughing come sunday 
                         little girl.

               muttering to himself, he turns back toward his house. he 
               then notices what adele is laughing at. one pitbull is trying 
               to hump the other.

                                     diebold
                         elvis! get the fuck off him!

               new angle - adele

               peering out at him from the trailer window laughing at the 
               dogs.
