               ext. motel corridor

               at the far end of a narrow hallway, carrie finds an ice 
               machine rumbling away noisily. the only illumination, a single 
               fluorescent light bulb, hangs suspended above it.

               at the ice machine

               with her arm buried inside the ice machine, carrie scavenges 
               for what little ice there is... when, out of the corner of 
               her eye, she notices...

               someone standing at the other end of the corridor. the 
               silhouette of a man.

               carrie stops. her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for 
               another way out. there is none.

               she tries to ignore the situation. grabs another handful of 
               ice cubes. the man approaches. carrie stops again. her mind 
               races. the man's face slowly becomes visible as he nears the 
               fluorescent light. it's early.

                                     early
                         ain't you done enough drinking for 
                         tonight?

                                     carrie
                         ...brian hurt his foot.

               early reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a 
               solitary cube. he puts it in his mouth, sucks on it. his 
               torso is drenched in sweat. he catches carrie staring at 
               him.

                                     early
                         sometimes... don't know why it is... 
                         i get so hot i can't stand it. i 
                         just start sweating like a dog. you 
                         ever get like that?

                                     carrie
                              (tenuous)
                         no.

               early spits the ice cube back into his hand. he presses it 
               against the back of his neck.

                                     early
                         i can feel it start to run down my 
                         neck...
                              (he turns his back to 
                              show her)
                         ...and down my back... right into my 
                         pants.

               carrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between 
               his shoulder blades and along his back.

                                     early
                         ...and everything starts stickin' 
                         together... keeps running down the 
                         back of my legs like two rivers racin' 
                         for my boots, see who gets there 
                         first.

               he snaps a look back to carrie and finds her looking at his 
               ass. she diverts her glance.

                                     early
                         you never get that hot, huh?

               carrie shakes her head no. early looks in his hand to see 
               that his ice cube has melted.

                                     carrie
                         i gotta get back before this ice 
                         melts.

               carrie tries to slip past him. he reaches back into the 
               machine, momentarily blocking her exit. he grabs another ice 
               cube. his face only inches from hers.

                                     early
                         ...never?

                                     carrie
                         no, never. excuse me.

               he pops the ice cube in his mouth and lets her pass.

                                     early
                         you like skynard?

               no response, early chews up the ice cube.
