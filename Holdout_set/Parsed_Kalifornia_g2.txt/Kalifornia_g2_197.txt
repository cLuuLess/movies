               he looks around the room... a smile forms on his face.

                                     early
                         howdy, my name's early grayce and 
                         this is my girl carrie. i hope you 
                         don't mind us bargin' in like this 
                         but a... we was on our way to 
                         california when our car broke down, 
                         and...

               early's pov (as he explains)

               a living room fully decorated in '50's furniture. sand covers 
               everything... including...

               a family of four mannequins placed around the room: the father 
               sits in front of the tv... the mother (the same mannequin as 
               in mr. musgrave's old picture) is toppled over a kitchen 
               counter... the little girl is seated at a table... the little 
               boy is playing with his toy plane on the floor.

                                     early (o.s.)
                         well... it's gettin' pretty rough 
                         out there, so if it's all the same 
                         to you, we'll be staying the night.
