               int. abattoir

               even in daylight, the interior of the dilapidated old building 
               is equal parts unnerving, austere, and menacing. the last 
               rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows. 
               the light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat-
               hooks hanging from the ceiling.

               carrie is getting her camera equipment ready. she's quiet 
               and uncommunicative.

               new angle

               close, on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest 
               on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room. 
               brian pops a cassette in the player.

                                     carrie
                         what's that?

                                     brian
                         a copy of a tape they found. he 
                         recorded everything.

               camera in hand, carrie begins to move about, despite the 
               fact that this place repels her.

               brian presses a button on the audio cassette player. the 
               small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we 
               slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman 
               being tortured and pleading for her life.

               flash!! flash!!

               carrie fires off a series of shots from different angles. 
               brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened. screams 
               from the audio tape bounce off the walls.

                                     brian
                              (speaks into his small 
                              hand held tape 
                              recorder)
                         his mother had him working in here 
                         before he was eight years old... 
                         killing animals with a sledgehammer 
                         that was bigger than he was.

               brian and carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into 
               another room.

                                     brian
                         when she was pissed at him, she'd 
                         beat the shit out of him and lock 
                         him in here overnight...

               the pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady 
               whimpering.

                                     brian
                              (continuing)
                         ...eventually the boy wakes up one 
                         morning, picks up that sledgehammer 
                         and starts hurting back.

               flash!! flash!!

               carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. then 
               she stops, turns and walks out of the room. she's had enough. 
               brian follows after her.

                                     brian
                         there's more...

                                     carrie
                         i'm finished.

               carrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear.

                                     brian
                         look... i know you're pissed off 
                         about the gun, and i don't blame 
                         you...

               carrie wheels around to face him.

                                     carrie
                         brian, i'm not pissed off. god damm 
                         it, turn that thing off.

               she switches off the cassette player.

                                     carrie
                         i'm scared. a week ago you would 
                         never have even thought to pick up 
                         that gun. this afternoon you're out 
                         there wielding it around like clyde 
                         fucking barrow, for christ's sake! 
                         what's with you?

                                     brian
                         okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was 
                         stupid, i admit it, alright?
                              (pause)
                         but let's not blow this. not now... 
                         let's just get the photos.

                                     carrie
                         i can't believe i agreed to do this.

                                     brian
                         oh come on, don't give me that shit... 
                         you wanted to take these photos as 
                         much as i wanted you too.

                                     carrie
                         wrong! i was willing to do whatever 
                         it took to get you up off your ass 
                         and on the way to california... 
                         there's a big difference.

               carrie storms out of the place. she exits the tunnel, and 
               makes her way toward...

               the lincoln

               as she approaches it, through the rear windshield she sees... 
               early and adele fucking wildly!

               carrie wants to turn away, but she can't stop watching them. 
               fascinated, she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on 
               them.

               through carrie's camera lens: on early and adele

               early is sitting against the back seat. adele is straddling 
               him. carrie's finger finds the shutter button.

               early's arms move up under adele's dress... her hands press 
               up against the roof. she's trembling... wavering... carrie's 
               finger presses down on the button, click!!

               then in one swift movement early sweeps adele onto the back 
               seat. close on early's face. he's sweating... lips moving... 
               talking dirty to adele.

               keeping her finger on the button, carrie rapid fires through 
               a whole roll of film. she's oblivious to the whine of the 
               motor drive once all the film is shot out.

               then unexpectedly!! early looks directly into the camera, at 
               carrie. and smiles... and continues to fuck adele.

               a chill rushes through carrie, she almost drops the camera. 
               she runs back toward the tunnel... and right into brian's 
               arms. he startles her. she pulls away from him.

                                     carrie
                         brian i want him out of our car!

                                     brian
                         why, what did he do?

                                     carrie
                         brian get him out of the car. next 
                         gas station either he leaves or i 
                         do!
