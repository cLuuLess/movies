               int. apartment - brian's ear - later that night

               still hearing the whine from some tremendous dynamo, we emerge 
               from the inside of brian's right eardrum, pulling back far 
               enough to see his face.

                                     kim (o.s.)
                         brian?

               brian is distracted, distant, not paying attention to the 
               game of "twenty questions" that he is playing.

                                     brian
                         dead.

                                     kim (o.s.)
                              (sarcastic)
                         obviously!

               new angle

               a small party in progress. graduate student types, smoking, 
               drinking. the usual. carrie and brian stand out in this group, 
               their look is more stylized, their attitude less complacent. 
               carrie, in particular, looks restless.

                                     carl
                         man or woman?

                                     brian
                         man.

               carrie tunes in and pays attention to the game.

                                     claudia
                         real or fictional.

                                     brian
                         real.

                                     carrie
                         ted bundy.

               brian's eyes dart to carrie. the look on his face tells 
               everyone she nailed it. brian gets up to get another drink. 
               several people laugh, amazed that carrie knows brian so well.

                                     claudia
                         what a guess!

                                     carl
                         doesn't count, she's disqualified.

                                     carrie
                         why?

                                     carl
                         because you've been living with him, 
                         and his thesis for the last year and 
                         a half.
                              (beat)
                         he's probably been researching ted 
                         bundy all week.

                                     peter
                         carl, you are the world's worst loser!

               carl looks over to carrie. she gives him the finger and a 
               cheeky smile.

               carol, sitting next to carrie, asks...

                                     carol
                         any word from that gallery?

                                     carrie
                         not yet.

                                     carol
                         nervous?

                                     carrie
                         ...apprehensive. let's not forget 
                         these are the people who banned the 
                         mapplethorpe show. anyway, 
                         california's loaded with galleries.

                                     carol
                              (nods toward brian)
                         you mean 'ted bundy's' finally agreed 
                         to leave?

               carrie watches brian disappear into another room.

                                     carrie
                         ...soon as he finishes his thesis.

                                     carol
                         listen, eric's been "finishing" his 
                         for over three years now.

               carrie lights a cigarette. her frustration is showing.

                                     carrie
                         yeah, well brian's got 'til the end 
                         of the summer, then i'm outta here.

               she gets up and begins weaving her way through the crowded 
               room. carol follows.

                                     carol
                         i'm sorry, but i just can't see you 
                         veggin' out in la-la land.

                                     carrie
                         oh, i don't know... i think that 
                         once i dye my hair blonde, buy a 
                         string bikini and cultivate that 
                         tan... i could be veggin' out with 
                         the best of 'em...
                              (does a valley-
                              girl/beach bunny)
                         like fer shurr!

               carrie and carol share a strained laugh.
