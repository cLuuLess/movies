               int. living room - same time - on brian and carrie

               brian and carrie are still cuffed to the piano, in the 
               background we see mrs. musgrave and adele looking out the 
               window into the backyard.

                                     brian
                              (whispers to carrie)
                         you gotta talk to her. she looks up 
                         to you, she'll listen to you.

                                     carrie
                         i tried talking to her at the mine. 
                         it didn't work.

                                     brian
                         then try again, (it's our only 
                         chance.)
