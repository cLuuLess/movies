               ext. desert - the smashed wooden gate

               the last rays of the setting sun reveal the pickup truck 
               heading toward the smashed remains of the wooden gate. the 
               pickup truck hurtles through the opening left by the lincoln.

               new angle

               on a collapsed old wooden sign. it lies on the ground a few 
               feet away from the gate posts.
