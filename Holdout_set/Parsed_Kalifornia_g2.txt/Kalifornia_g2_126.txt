               int. an old deserted abattoir - afternoon

               the lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure. brian 
               glances to the back seat to make a remark to early and adele 
               and sees that they are amorously engaged.

               brian and carrie start to gather their stuff. carrie opens 
               the glove compartment, inside are boxes of film... and the 
               .45 automatic. she takes a few packs of film, and closes the 
               glove compartment.

                                     early
                         tell ya bri., i'm still a little 
                         sleepy,... think adele and me are 
                         gonna take us a fiesta.

                                     carrie
                              (pissed off)
                         siesta.

               carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition, 
               locks the glove compartment and pockets the key. both she 
               and brian exit the car. as they start to walk toward the 
               structure brian hears a sound, he turns back to see. adele 
               leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincoln's big white 
               top starts to come up.
