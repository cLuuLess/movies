               int. bowling alley bar

               the patrons are young men and women. eighteen to thirty. the 
               river's edge kids today. leather. ludes and beer. wasted. 
               rowdy.

               we follow one of the waitresses through the bar... as she 
               passes by a pool table one of the players, a large young 
               cracker, makes a grab at her...

                                     large young cracker
                         when you gonna give me so o' that!

               she spins safely out of his reach.

                                     waitress
                         maybe when you grow up a little sonny.

               some guys, close enough to hear her over the noise, laugh at 
               her put down. she moves on until she reaches...

               brian standing near a small high table. early's not with 
               him. she sets four beers down on the table. brian tries to 
               talk to her over the music. he leans in close. his mouth to 
               her ear.

                                     brian
                         these aren't lucky lager, i ordered 
                         lucky lager.

                                     waitress
                         sorry honey, 'ain't nothin lucky 
                         around here.

               the waitress laughs. brian smiles and glances around the 
               room. he notices the large young cracker staring at him.

               across the room

               early steps out of the bathroom and makes his way back to 
               brian.

               new angle on brian

               he watches the waitress disappear into the crowd, then turns 
               to find the large young cracker in his face!

                                     young cracker
                         what did you say to her city boy!

               the young cracker is obviously very drunk.

                                     brian
                         nothing, i jus...

                                     young cracker
                              (cuts him off)
                         what's a jism gargling cum drunk 
                         fairy like you looking at a pretty 
                         girl like that for anyway?

               the young cracker doesn't notice early return from the 
               bathroom. he moves in next to brian. early is relaxed and 
               nonchalant as he looks over the young cracker. he leans closer 
               to brian.

                                     early
                              (matter of factly)
                         you'd better hit him first bri', 
                         'cos it's comin'.

               with his eyes on brian, early grabs a beer. brian is scared, 
               and confused, with one ear and one eye on the young cracker, 
               the other on early.

                                     young cracker
                         this yur' boyfriend?

                                     brian
                              (dumbfounded)
                         what?

                                     early
                         hit him.

               early looks at the beer.

                                     early
                              (angry)
                         bri' this shit ain't lucky lager!

               early takes a swig off the beer, grimaces and sprays it out. 
               it hits the young cracker. the cracker looks down at his 
               shirt in shock. early is oblivious.

                                     young cracker
                              (to early)
                         hey asshole!

               brian is frozen, confused, doesn't know who to address. early 
               continues to ignore the young cracker.

                                     brian
                         they don't stock it here early.

                                     young cracker
                              (to early, furious)
                         why you fuckin'...

               the young cracker moves to hit early. early swiftly smashes 
               his beer bottle into the oncoming face. the young cracker 
               doubles over clutching his face in agony. early kicks him in 
               the face, sending the young cracker to the ground. early 
               finishes him off with several more kicks from his heavy work 
               boots.

               two large tough guys approach early and brian. brian's heart 
               racing, early cool as a cucumber. instead of taking on early, 
               they stop, reach down and drag the unconscious man away. the 
               waitress returns to their table.

                                     waitress
                         sorry about that, he's always causing 
                         trouble.

               she sets down two beers and two shots, doubles.

                                     waitress
                         these are on the house.
