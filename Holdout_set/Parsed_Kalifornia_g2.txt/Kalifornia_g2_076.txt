               ext. motel - later

               early walks toward the lincoln. it is parked outside brian 
               and carrie's room. the front door is ajar, he pushes it open. 
               he sees carrie's reflection in the bathroom mirror, she's in 
               her underwear, pulling on her jeans. early watches her for a 
               moment. there's no mistaking what's on his mind... as his 
               eyes scan her body. carrie pulls on her t-shirt, steps out 
               of the bathroom and sees early just outside the door.

                                     early
                         ...need a hand with those bags?

                                     carrie
