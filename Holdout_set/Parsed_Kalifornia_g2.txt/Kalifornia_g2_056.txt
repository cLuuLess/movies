               ext. rear of house - same time

               looking into the house through a kitchen window we can see 
               into the entrance hall and through to the open front door. 
               brian waits outside on the porch, as the little girl enters 
               the house looking for her father. inside the kitchen, right 
               next to the window, is a side table with a telephone and a 
               purse on it.

               suddenly... early's reflection appears in the window; he has 
               obviously seen the purse.

               at the front door

               brian motions for carrie to join him.

               at the swing set

               adele watches brian and carrie for a moment, then loses 
               interest. she stands on the seat of the swing and begins 
               swinging.

               at the rear of the house

               early tries to push up the kitchen window. it barely lifts 
               three inches before jamming. through the room we see the 
               little girl and her father step to the front door.
