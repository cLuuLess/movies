               int. kitchen - same time

               adele quietly opens the back door.

                                     adele
                         go on now... please.

               mrs. musgrave is confused, is it a trick? she looks into 
               adele's eyes... and knows it's not. the old lady turns and 
               walks out into the dark desert. adele stands at the open 
               door, watching mrs musgrave escape.

                                     adele
                              (in a whisper)
                         ...call me.
