               int. lincoln - same time

               early still behind the wheel. carrie sits up against the 
               passenger side door. she is tense and guarded. out the window, 
               nothing but empty desert.

                                     early
                         pass me a beer hon'.

               carrie quietly responds. she kneels on the front seat and 
               reaches into the back. she grabs a bottle by its neck, and 
               pulls it from the six pack of beer. bottle in hand, she 
               hesitates a moment...

               new angle: early's pov in the driving mirror

               early watches carrie.

                                     early
                         you wanna hit me with that, huh?

               new angle

               carrie reconsiders and sits back in the far corner of the 
               front seat.

                                     carrie
                              (not looking at him)
                         no.

               she hands the bottle to him. early reaches out for the beer, 
               but instead of taking it, he clasps his hand over hers.

               he looks at her and begins to squeeze...

                                     early
                         stop lyin'... i can see right through 
                         you.

               early squeezes even harder -- carrie begins to wince with 
               pain. she waits for the glass bottle to shatter in her hand.

                                     early
                         who d'ya think you're foolin'?
                              (beat)
                         i know you better than you think...

                                     carrie
                              (confused)
                         ...you're hurting me...

               early hits the brakes. the car screeches to a halt in a cloud 
               of dust. early squeezes on her hand even harder and begins 
               to drag her toward him.

                                     early
                         i seen the way you been lookin' at 
                         me since we met... snappin' my photo 
                         when you thought i wasn't lookin'. 
                         wanting me...

               carrie turns her head away. early pulls her closer.

                                     early
                         i saw you when i killed that boy...

               he grabs her hair with his other hand... pulls her head around -- 
               forcing her to look at him. early has carrie right up against 
               him, looking right into her eyes.

                                     early
                              (whispers)
                         you were plenty hot.

                                     carrie
                              (explodes)
                         you sick twisted fuck! you don't 
                         know shit about me.

               she struggles trying to free herself. early, his face only 
               inches from hers, smiles...

                                     early
                         sick... some people might say takin' 
                         photos of me and adele humpin' in 
                         the back of the car is sick.

               carrie struggles even harder, but early tightens his hold.

                                     early
                         ...you know what i mean?

                                     carrie
                         ...i know i'd love to smash this 
                         bottle right in your fucking face.

               suddenly... early releases carrie, taking the beer from her. 
               carrie retreats back into the corner of the passenger side.

                                     early
                         that's better... honesty... i like 
                         that in a woman.

               he gives her a grin, then opens the bottle.

                                     early
                         but i'll tell ya... when we get to 
                         california, we're gonna have to do 
                         something 'bout that gutter mouth of 
                         yours.

               early takes a gulp of beer.
