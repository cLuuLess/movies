                                     brian
                         you wanted to.
                              (beat)
                         why?

               flash! brian flinches. early remains silent as he closes in 
               on brian.

                                     brian
                         it make you feel good? powerful?
                              (flash!)
                         superior, what? come on early, tell 
                         me something.
                              (flash!)
                         were you angry?

               early's boot lands toe to toe with brian's shoe.

                                     brian
                              (tentative)
                         who are you angry with early... your 
                         mother, your father?

               eye to eye, the two men stand there.

                                     early
                         you want to know about my daddy, 
                         i'll tell you about my daddy, bri...
