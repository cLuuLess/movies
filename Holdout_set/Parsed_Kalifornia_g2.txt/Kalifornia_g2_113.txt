               int. brian and carrie's motel room - later

               the door opens revealing brian silhouetted in the doorway. 
               under the influence of lucky lager, he fumbles with the key... 
               gets inside and noisily shuts the door behind him. carrie 
               remains stonily silent, in the dark.

                                     brian
                         gotta see a man about a mule... what's 
                         wrong?

               a few seconds pass.

                                     carrie
                         the same thing that's been "wrong" 
                         the whole trip. your good buddy early.

               carrie, in bed, switches on the side table light. reveals 
               brian leaning on the wall trying to get his shoes off without 
               falling over.

                                     brian
                         who said he's my good buddy?

                                     carrie
                         you sure been acting like you were...
                              (redneck accent)
                         ...out whoopin' it up, a drankin' 
                         and ever' thang.

               brian points to the empty beer bottles on the table.

                                     brian
                         hey come on, you two were drinking 
                         too... so what's the big deal.

               brian throws his shoes somewhere and heads toward the 
               bathroom.

                                     carrie
                         yeah, and you should've seen how 
                         terrified she was that he'd find 
                         out. he beats her.

                                     brian
                         how do you know that?

                                     carrie
                         she told me...
                              (adding)
                         ...but only when she "deserves" it. 
                         did you know he was in jail?

               bathroom

               brian turns on the light. takes a piss. a long one.

                                     brian
                         yeah, for stealing a car. aaahhhh.

               suddenly, from right behind him:

                                     carrie (o.s.)
                         bullshit!

               startled, brian turns to see carrie.

                                     carrie
                         ...he told her it was for carrying a 
                         gun, but the truth could be murder 
                         for all we know.

               no response from brian. carrie walks away.

               living room

               carrie steps over to the bed, pulls the sheets back. brian 
               leans out the bathroom door:

                                     brian
                         stop being so fucking melodramatic! 
                         if it was murder he'd still be locked 
                         up or on parole, in which case he 
                         wouldn't be allowed to leave the 
                         state.

                                     carrie
                         maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! 
                         geezus brian!

               brian smacks himself on the forehead (a sarcastic "how stupid 
               of me!") he pulls his shirt off over his head, and admits...

                                     brian
                              (sarcastically)
                         of course! the accent, the clothes, 
                         and those table manners!... he's got 
                         to be a mass murderer!
                              (pause)
                         what else could he be?

               he switches off the bathroom light, steps out of the doorway, 
               and begins to pull his jeans off. carrie climbs into bed.

                                     brian
                         you know, it wouldn't even surprise 
                         me if he turned out to be... a 
                         republican!

               brian tosses his jeans and moves toward the bed. carrie 
               switches off the the only light in the room. in the dark, we 
               hear a thud as brian trips over a chair.

                                     brian
                         goddamnit!... my fucking toe!
