               ext. front door

               a middle aged farmer with tanned leathery skin. he is not 
               happy. brian extends his hand...

                                     brian
                              (friendly)
                         hi, my name is brian kessler.

               the father says nothing and does not respond to the extended 
               hand. brian retracts his hand.

                                     brian
                              (continues -- less 
                              confident)
                         i'm a writer, i'm working on a book 
                         about famous murderers.

               at the swing set

               adele swings higher. her summer dress ripples in the wind. a 
               smile on her face.
