               brian's heads bangs against the side window.

                                     brian
                         what! what!

               carrie nods toward the back seat. brian turns and sees adele 
               looking back at them questioningly. beside her, early rustles.

                                     brian
                         what is it?

                                     carrie
                         look again!

               brian notices that adele's rummaging has revealed an automatic 
               pistol in the open canvas bag. brian stares at it. early's 
               eyes open.
