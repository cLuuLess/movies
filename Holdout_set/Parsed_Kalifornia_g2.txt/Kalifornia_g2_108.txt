               ext. motel - dusk

               a high angle looks down on the modest cluster of rooms below. 
               the motel sign pulses erratically in foreground. moths flicker 
               about the light.

               closer

               the lincoln is parked in front of brian and carrie's room. 
               the horn honks. early is behind the wheel, engine running. 
               brian steps out of the motel room.

                                     carrie (o.s.)
                         hey minnesota fats!

               carrie appears at the door holding her camera.

                                     carrie
                              (sarcastic)
                         don't forget your key.

               she hands brian the key.

                                     brian
                         why'd i open my big mouth?

               brian takes the key and walks to the car.

               carrie sees adele standing outside her door. brian enters 
               the lincoln.

                                     carrie
                              (to adele)
                         why didn't you go with them?

               the lincoln pulls away.

                                     adele
                         i told you how early feels 'bout a 
                         woman drinking.

                                     carrie
                         how'd you meet early?

               carrie swings the camera around to adele, and snaps off a 
               shot.

                                     adele
                              (grins)
                         i was hitchhiking' one day and he 
                         picked me up. at first i wasn't gonna 
                         get in on account of his car was in 
                         such sorry shape. i said, "i ain't 
                         never seen a white man drivin' a car 
                         like this."

               carrie snaps another shot of adele. every once in a while 
               adele feels like she should be "posing" for the shots that 
               carrie's taking of her. so, occasionally, as she carries on 
               her conversation with carrie, she does.

                                     adele
                              (continues)
                         an' he said right back, "you shouldn't 
                         judge by appearances little lady... 
                         this vehicle might just be a flying 
                         saucer disguised as a car, for all 
                         you know."

               carrie's pov thru camera - as she zooms in tighter on adele

                                     adele
                         well, i got in and we got to talkin', 
                         and the next thing i know, i'd moved 
                         in with him in this old trailer.
                              (beat)
                         hey! wouldn't it be something if we 
                         all ended up sharing a house together 
                         in california?

               on carrie

               she lowers the camera from her eye and studies adele.

                                     carrie
                         you know i can fix that haircut for 
                         you, if you want?

                                     adele
                         you can?
