               int. lobby of the administration building - afternoon

               brian steps up to a large bulletin board. he sees several 
               'ride-share' notes to various cities on the board. he pins a 
               ride-share note onto the board. we see the note is headlined 
               in red - "california"

                                     carol
                         you know, they say one of these 
                         days...

               brian glances over his shoulder.

                                     brian
                              (sarcastic)
                         ...the whole thing's going to slide 
                         into the ocean... yeah, i know.

               carol peers over brian's shoulder and reads the note.

                                     carol
                         "looking for someone to take turns 
                         at the wheel and share expenses...

                              (beat)
                         you gotta be kidding. who in their 
                         right mind would want to do that?

                                     brian
                         ...i would.

               brian smiles at her and walks away.

                                     carol
                              (watching brian walk 
                              away)
                         like i said...

               she shakes her head.

                                     early
                         where's the personnel office at?

               carol turns to see early.

                                     rita
                              (points down the hall)
                         first door on the left.

               she walks away. early's eye catches the bulletin board, he 
               sees in bold red marker - "california."
