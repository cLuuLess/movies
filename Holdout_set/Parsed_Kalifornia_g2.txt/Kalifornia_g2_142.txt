               ext. gas station

               early drags carrie out of the office toward the car. brian 
               sees them running toward the car. they spill into the back 
               seat. brian sees carrie is upset.

                                     brian
                         carrie, what's wrong?
                              (to early)
                         early, we went through this already, 
                         you have to leave.

               from the back seat early wipes some more feathers from his 
               face, then points the attendant's gun at brian's head.

                                     early
                              (spits out a feather)
                         'fraid not bri'... drive adele.

               adele starts the car. she pulls out of the station and into 
               the rainstorm.
