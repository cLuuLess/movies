               ext. brian and carrie's loft - dawn

               brian exits loft carrying two bags. carrie is also carrying 
               a bag, and smoking a cigarette, as they walk to the car.

                                     carrie
                         what did he sound like on the phone?

               omitted

                                     brian
                         real polite. kept calling me 'sir.'

               brian throws the bags in the open trunk with the other bags.

                                     brian
                              (grins)
                         i like that.

                                     carrie
                         i still think we should have met 
                         them first.

                                     brian
                         beggars can't be choosers. they were 
                         the only ones who answered the ride 
                         share note, remember?

               carrie bows her head and folds her hands in mock prayer.

                                     carrie
                         please god, we're gonna be stuck 
                         with these people for a week, don't 
                         let them be as boring as brian's 
                         friends. anything... but that.

               brian throws a needling glance to carrie and slams the car 
               hood shut. they both get into the car, brian behind the wheel.
