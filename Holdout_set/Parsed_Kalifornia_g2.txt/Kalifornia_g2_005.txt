               int. roofless old warehouse - night

               the beam of brian's flashlight sweeps through the darkness, 
               revealing another room.

                                     brian
                         this is it. this is the where he'd 
                         take her whenever he had the urge to 
                         molest her.

               the flashlight finds the corner in question. flash!! the 
               warehouse lights up again, revealing a huge machine room.

                                     brian
                         of course! nobody would have heard 
                         her cries over the noise of the 
                         machines.
