               ext. kitchen window

               early's entire arm is through the opening. his shoulder 
               presses against the window pane. but still he can't reach 
               the purse. so, he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it 
               toward him. the purse slides closer, inch by inch. all the 
               while, he keeps one eye on the farmer across the room.

               early's pov (across the room) the farmer's back is turned to 
               the kitchen as he listens silently to brian.

                                     brian
                         ...i'm sure you're aware that this 
                         is the novak house...

               at the swing set

               adele swings even higher. she's lost in the moment. euphoric.
