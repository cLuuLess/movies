               ext. - night

               it's raining like hell. flashes of lightning reveal momentary 
               glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. far below 
               us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the 
               drowning earth. we descend toward the rock. sporadic flashes 
               of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. it looks 
               strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... 
               closer... closer...

               suddenly, strong male hands cut across the frame and wrench 
               it free from its muddy grave. even closer... and we discover 
               that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with 
               every kind of slithering repulsive insect... flash!!* 
               lightning obliterates the frame.

               (* flashes of light from lightning, car headlights, 
               photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout 
               the following sequences as recurring transitional devices.)

               city street ext. night

               we can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of 
               an inner city -- what we can see looks half demolished. 
               flash!!

               through chain link fencing, the blinding headlights of a 
               70's chevy arc into frame. for an instant we see the fleeting 
               image of a pretty teenage girl. on her feet a pair of bright 
               red high heeled shoes. the chevy pulls up next to her.
