               ext. early's burning trailer - dawn

               from the blackness... the camera rises from a pile of rubble. 
               as it ascends we reveal diebold's pitbulls howling and digging 
               at a mound of fresh earth where early's hole used to be.

               the crackling flames of a nearby fire illuminate the scene. 
               deep in the distance, the wail of approaching sirens.

               another angle

               reveal that it's early's trailer and car that are on fire.
