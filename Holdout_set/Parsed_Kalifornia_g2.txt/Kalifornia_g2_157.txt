               carrie walks over to adele at the car. adele doesn't miss a 
               beat with her yoyo.

                                     carrie
                         adele, listen to me... early's sick; 
                         he should be in a hospital.

               adele screws up the trick. she pulls the yoyo off her finger 
               and throws it in the back seat. she leans into the front 
               seat and cranks the radio up to the max. closing her eyes, 
               she begins moving to the music, and tries to ignore carrie.

                                     carrie
                              (shouting over the 
                              music)
                         the police are after him, he's a 
                         murderer!

                                     adele
                              (uncertain)
                         ...that's not true.

                                     carrie
                              (shouting)
                         what?

                                     adele
                              (shouting back)
                         that's not true!

               new angle

               a police car pulls into frame, unnoticed by carrie and adele 
               in the background.
