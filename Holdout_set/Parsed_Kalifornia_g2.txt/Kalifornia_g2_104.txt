               ext. gas station

               early exits the bathroom... and runs straight into brian, 
               about to enter.

                                     early
                              (friendly)
                         hey bri'... ah... you don't want to 
                         go in there. it's a real mess, if 
                         you know what i mean.

               brian glances at the bathroom door. down below, a thin stream 
               of the fat man's blood begins to trickle out from under the 
               door... just barely touching the toe of brian's shoe.

                                     brian
                         that bad?

                                     early
                         ...then some.

               early puts his arm around brian and turns him back toward 
               the car.

               at the car

               adele takes a photo of them, approaching. the attendant steps 
               up to carrie.

                                     attendant
                              (to carrie)
                         comes to twenty eight dollars.

                                     carrie
                         talk to him.

               carrie points to early. as brian and early approach the car, 
               early pulls out the money clip.

                                     early
                         call it an even thirty.

               early peels off thirty bucks from the money clip. he sees 
               carrie watching him, early smiles.

                                     early
                         i'll drive bri'.

               hearing that, carrie climbs into the back seat. adele climbs 
               over the backrest into the frontseat.

                                     early
                         adele, get in the back.

               she climbs again into the backseat.
