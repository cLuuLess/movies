               ext. musgrave house - early morning

               as early finishes tieing one of the replicant bombs, little 
               boy onto the hood. he reaches down and grabs a six pack of 
               beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat, then slides 
               into the driver's seat next to an anxious carrie. carrie is 
               now wearing one of adele's floral dresses.

                                     early
                         think anyone will notice?

               carrie doesn't answer, early laughs.
