               ext. old deserted mine area - later that day

               the lincoln drives down the dirt access road and stops. they 
               all get out, early unties brian and carrie.

                                     early
                         figured your hands might be starting 
                         to hurt.

               early looks down the hill to the old mine building.

                                     early
                         let's have a look. you girls coming?

               carrie's steely gaze answers early's question.

                                     adele
                         can i just wait here?

               early leans into the car and picks up adele's camera.

                                     early
                         don't worry bri', i'll take the 
                         pictures.
                              (to adele, with a 
                              kiss to her cheek)
                         ...you stay here with carrie.
                              (to carrie)
                         you run off... bri' pays the price. 
                         karma, remember?

               pistol in hand, early follows brian down the hill. adele 
               begins nervously playing with her yoyo.

               carrie watches as brian and early disappear around a bend in 
               the dirt road. out of the corner of her eye, she hones in on 
               adele's yoyo.

               adele becomes increasingly intense about manipulating the 
               yoyo, controlling it. until she's lost in it. a momentary 
               refuge.

                                     adele
                         this is called walk the dog.

               new angle - extreme cu

               a huge excruciatingly tight shot of the yoyo in slow motion. 
               its string unraveling as it spins downward. carrie pulls her 
               gaze away.

               carrie's pov

               the desolate surrounding landscape, a bright blue sky, the 
               scrubbrush. and no one who can help them. carrie turns and 
               looks over her shoulder down the hill.
