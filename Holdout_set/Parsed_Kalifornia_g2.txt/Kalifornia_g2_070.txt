               carrie finishes brushing her teeth. secretively she gives 
               brian the finger...

                                     brian (o.s.)
                         ...heard that too.

               carrie glances at the bath water running in the tub. it's 
               rusty brown and disgusting. she pulls the plug on the bath 
               idea.
