               int. musgrave living room - a little later

               close on a porcelain cactus

               one of many we now reveal to be atop a fireplace mantle. 
               adele leans in against the mantle and scrutinizes the cactus.

               carrie and brian sit on the floor, back to back, their arms 
               bound around the leg of a piano by a pair of police handcuffs. 
               mrs. musgrave is standing nearby. she's overwhelmed. numb. 
               she pours herself a glass of bourbon.

                                     mrs. musgrave
                              (to herself)
                         it's just like in that dream i had. 
                         if only i had seen their faces.

               she takes her drink and sits down on the couch nearby. adele 
               drops down quietly on the chair next to her.

                                     adele
                              (tries to cheer mrs. 
                              musgrave up)
                         you've got beautiful cactuses here, 
                         i just love 'em. my momma used to 
                         keep a garden.

               mrs. musgrave downs most of her drink with the first try. 
               distressed, her head slumps down.

                                     early (o.s.)
                              (from the kitchen)
                         hey bri... you ever stop to think 
                         that if you switched the two letters 
                         in your name...
                              (entering the room)
                         ...it would spell brain.

               early, his pistol wedged in his belt, appears from the kitchen 
               eating a sandwich. between bites... he walks over and rips 
               the phone out of the wall unit. he glimpses mrs. musgrave.

                                     early
                         what's wrong with her?

                                     adele
                              (sorry for her)
                         she had a dream that somethin' like 
                         this was gonna happen.

               early notices the glass of bourbon in her trembling hands. 
               he steps over to her and takes the glass away.

                                     early
                         i'll bet she did.

               he sets the glass down next to a recent picture of mrs. 
               musgrave and an elderly man with silver hair.

                                     early
                         where's your husband?

                                     mrs. musgrave
                              (lying)
                         ...i'm a widow.

               early looks at her, he doesn't believe her.
