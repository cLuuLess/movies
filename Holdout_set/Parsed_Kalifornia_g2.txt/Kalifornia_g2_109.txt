               ext. bowling alley bar - night

               a nondescript "joint" on the outskirts of town. american 
               cars. american pickup trucks parked outside. the lincoln 
               pulls into foreground and parks. early gets out of the lincoln 
               and looks around.

                                     early
                         i wonder if there's any "doors" out 
                         here?

               brian exits the lincoln and looks at early questioning.

                                     early
                         you know... "openings" to other 
                         dimensions.
                              (pause)
                         i read there are a lot of them out 
                         west, mostly in the desert. they say 
                         if you know what you're doing, you 
                         can travel anywhere in the universe 
                         in a matter of seconds. wouldn't 
                         that come in handy?

               brian looks at him blankly. he can't think of a thing to say 
               in response. early walks toward the entrance of the bar. 
               brian joins him.

                                     brian
                         by the way, i'm not much of a pool 
                         player.

                                     early
                         shit, it ain't hard to play pool. i 
                         can teach you everything ya need ta 
                         know.

                                     brian
                         yeah?

                                     early
                         hell yeah! i'll even spot ya a few 
                         points first game.

                                     brian
                         wait a minute. you're gonna hustle 
                         me?

                                     early
                         nah... how much money have you got?

               they both laugh and enter the bar.

               carrie's motel room - same time

               adele is sitting in a chair in front of the dresser mirror 
               drinking a beer. carrie is cutting her hair. in the mirror 
               adele watches carrie for a moment. she notices the cigarette 
               dangling from her lips.

                                     adele
                         how do you get your cigarette to 
                         stay there like that.

               carrie looks in the mirror.

                                     carrie
                         i'm cool.

                                     adele
                         could i try that?

               carrie takes out a fresh cigarette and hands it to adele. 
               together they stare into the mirror with their dangling 
               cigarettes. adele drops her cigarette, as she reaches down 
               for it she notices carrie's portfolio.

                                     adele
                         what's this?

                                     carrie
                         it's a portfolio of my work.

                                     adele
                         your pictures. can i see 'em?

                                     carrie
                         sure.

               adele grabs the black leather binder and sets it in her lap. 
               carrie continues to cut adele's hair. adele opens the binder 
               and takes a look at the first erotic image and slaps the 
               cover back down. she's embarrassed.

                                     adele
                         jesus!

               carrie watches her in amusement. after a moment, adele 
               reconsiders, and opens the book. she gazes at the shocking 
               photograph.

                                     adele
                         you took this picture?

                                     carrie
                         took 'em all.

               carrie resumes cutting adele's hair. adele thumbs through 
               several photographs.

                                     carrie
                         that's me.

                                     adele
                         no it is not!

                                     carrie
                         hold still.

                                     adele
                         sorry. boy i'll tell ya, if early 
                         found a picture of me like that i'd 
                         be black and blue for a week.

               adele notices carrie's scowl in the dresser mirror. carrie 
               stops cutting.

                                     carrie
                              (suddenly serious)
                         you shouldn't let him do that to 
                         you...

                                     adele
                         do what?

                                     carrie
                         adele... are you serious?

                                     adele
                              (defensive)
                         you think early's bad to me, don't 
                         you?

                                     carrie
                         yeah.

               carrie starts cutting adele's hair again.

                                     adele
                         well... you're wrong. i ain't saying 
                         early ain't never hit me... but he 
                         never hurt me.

               when carrie doesn't respond, adele grabs carrie's scissor 
               hand and stops her from continuing. carrie looks at adele's 
               reflection in the dresser mirror.

                                     adele
                              (continues)
                         ...when i was fourteen years old 
                         three boys raped me in the back of a 
                         truck, and beat me so bad i was in 
                         bed for almost four months...
                              (beat)
                         ...i feel safe with early, most the 
                         time he treats me pretty good. and i 
                         know he wouldn't let nothin' like 
                         that ever happen to me again...

               carrie is speechless, adele looks in the mirror at her new 
               haircut.

                                     adele
                         hey, that ain't so bad now.
