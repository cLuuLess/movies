               ext. lincoln/highway - noon

               brian and early unload the trunk to get to the spare tire.

               at the right front tire

               brian struggles with the wheel and the jack.

                                     early
                         here bri' let me do that.

               early takes over. he pulls off his shirt, jacks the car up 
               and begins replacing the wheel with ease.

                                     early
                         how did he get away with it for so 
                         long anyhow?

                                     brian
                         he almost always killed strangers. 
                         spent years moving on from one place 
                         to another. that made it real hard 
                         to track him down.

               carrie scans the landscape with her camera. she sees adele 
               walking around a small roadside graveyard. she is reading 
               the epitaphs on the headstones. carrie fires off a few shots. 
               then she sees early, she can't help but notice early's lean 
               body. she zooms in on his muscles and prison tattoo. click!!

               early completes the task. together he and brian begin putting 
               everything back in the trunk.

               suddenly, from behind, adele jumps onto early's back, 
               surprising him. he gives her a "horsey ride" around the 
               lincoln.

               on carrie

               she notices early's wallet on the ground.

               on early and adele

               she's riding him, covering his eyes playfully.

               on carrie

               she picks up the wallet.

               beneath the lincoln

               early's feet galloping.

               on carrie

               she opens the wallet to find two one dollar bills inside.

               with early and adele

               as they come around the side of the car and to a stop in 
               front of carrie. she holds up his wallet... watches his eyes.

                                     carrie
                         you dropped this.

                                     adele
                         early grayce if this ain't your lucky 
                         day.

               she hands the wallet back to him. something between them 
               goes unspoken.
