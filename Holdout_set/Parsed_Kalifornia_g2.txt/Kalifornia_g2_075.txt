               int. motel diner

               early enters the diner drinking his morning beer. adele is 
               not with him. he spots brian and carrie seated opposite one 
               another in one of the booths. he walks up to their table and 
               drops down uninvited on the seat next to carrie.

                                     brian
                         morning...

               early lifts his beer bottle in salute.

                                     early
                         bri'.

                                     carrie
                         where's adele?

                                     early
                         she wasn't feeling so good.

               the waitress arrives with a menu, offers it to early.

                                     waitress
                         breakfast?

                                     early
                              (burps)
                         nah... don't eat breakfast. never 
                         have.

               the waitress notices early's bottle of beer.

                                     waitress
                         ah sir... sir.

               she gets early's attention.

                                     waitress
                              (concerned)
                         we ah... don't have a liquor license 
                         here. so i'm afraid...

                                     early
                         well don't be, i got plenty more 
                         where this one came from.

               the waitress gives him a curious look and walks away.

               just then, brian look past early... a surprised expression 
               crosses brian's face. early turns to see... adele approaching 
               the table. her hair has been crudely chopped to resemble 
               carrie's. it looks like shit.

                                     carrie
                              (at a loss for words)
                         you cut your hair.

               adele smiles, pleased with carrie for noticing. she sits 
               down next to brian.

                                     adele
                         early cut it.
                              (smiles at early)
                         ...once he gets an idea in his head 
                         there's no holding him back.

               carrie looks to brian curiously. adele is distracted by a 
               small cactus on the window near the table.

                                     brian
                         nice job early.

               carrie notices adele's 'new' (stolen) purse... we see the 
               wheels turning in carrie's head. how? where?
