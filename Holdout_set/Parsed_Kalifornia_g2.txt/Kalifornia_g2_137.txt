               adele opens the door on the driver's side looking scared. 
               brian is in the passenger seat. he's looking in the glove 
               compartment for a map. the .45 automatic early gave brian is 
               clearly visible. adele stares at it.

                                     brian
                         adele, what are you doing back here?

               adele gets in and starts looking under the seats.

                                     adele
                         ...lost my purse... could you help 
                         me look for it? it's probably under 
                         the seat.
