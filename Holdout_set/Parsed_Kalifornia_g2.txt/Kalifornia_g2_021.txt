               ext. early's trailer - late morning

               early emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer. he 
               looks around the yard, it's full of various kinds of useless 
               junk. he walks over to his car. adele appears in the doorway 
               of the trailer in her bathrobe.

                                     adele
                         early...

               she glances around to make certain that no one's looking, 
               then 'flashes' her body to early with a giggle.

                                     adele
                         have a good one.

               early smiles. adele turns back into the trailer then, 
               remembers...

                                     adele
                         oh... i forgot to tell you, mr. 
                         diebold was by again yesterday.

               early looks at the run down house next door where diebold 
               lives. a beat up red pick-up is parked in front.

                                     adele
                         he said, if he ain't got the rest of 
                         his money by the end of the month, 
                         he's gonna "kick us the...
                              (spells the word fuck 
                              to avoid saying it)
                         f-u-c-k outta here."

               early works his jaw, thinking.

                                     early
                         he said that, huh? cursed in front 
                         of you?

               adele nods.

                                     adele
                         you gonna talk to him?

               early gets in his car.

                                     early
                         if he comes back, don't answer the 
                         door.

               early revs the raspy engine.

                                     adele
                         suppose he hears me inside?

               adele's words are unheard as early pulls away flinging his 
               beer bottle at a couple of chained pitbulls in diebold's 
               front yard.
