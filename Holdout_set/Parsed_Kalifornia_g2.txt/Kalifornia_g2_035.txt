               ext. bus station - dawn

               pan up from adele's new red high-heeled shoes. we hear adele 
               speaking with an unfamiliar tone of authority to her voice.

                                     adele
                         we shouldn't be doin' this, early. 
                         you leavin' the state, ridin' around 
                         with strangers... besides, what kinda 
                         people would want to stop at places 
                         where other people was murdered.

               the camera slowly reveals adele... and the fact that she is 
               alone as she voices her concerns. then from behind her early 
               approaches. just in time to hear...

                                     adele
                         what if they're dangerous?

                                     early
                         they ain't dangerous adele. they're 
                         writers.

               startled, adele drops her shoulder bag. it lands on top of a 
               couple of cardboard boxes and a beat up old duffle bag -- 
               all their possessions. a few personal items spill out of it.

                                     adele
                         early grayce!

               she kneels down to pick things up.

                                     adele
                              (changes subject)
                         did you settle things with mr. 
                         diebold?

                                     early
                         yeah i left him with the car... we're 
                         all squared up now.

               early's pov

               as adele picks up her spilled personal possessions, early 
               notices her prized cactus in the bag.

                                     early
                         what's this?

               he angrily reaches in and grabs it.

                                     adele
                         early!

               she reaches for the cactus but misses.

                                     early
                         what kind of a person would carry a 
                         cactus in her purse!

               adele bites her lip almost crying. suddenly, early looks 
               past adele to see something, adele turns too.

               new angle

               the lincoln comes gliding into view.
