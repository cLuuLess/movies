               int. carrie and brian's motel room - night

               carrie and adele split the last bottle of beer between them. 
               they are sitting on the floor and adele has carrie's foot in 
               her lap. she's painting carrie's toenails bright red. neither 
               of them is feeling any pain.

                                     adele
                         my momma's a beautician. guess that's 
                         where i get it from. she wouldn't 
                         hear of my moving in with early... 
                         on account of his just getting out 
                         of jail and all. ain't seen her in 
                         nearly a year now. i wish she'd call 
                         me, just once.

                                     carrie
                              (interrupting)
                         what's early been in jail for?

                                     adele
                              (reluctantly)
                         carryin' a gun.

                                     carrie
                         ...anything else?

                                     adele
                         an' resistin' arrest... at least 
                         that's what the police said.

                                     carrie
                         jeez... adele!

               adele realizes she has said too much, looks at her watch.

                                     adele
                         i'd better be goin'. it's late.

               adele hastily weaves her way out the door.

                                     carrie
                         great.

               carrie stares down at her feet. red toenails. cottonballs 
               between the toes.
