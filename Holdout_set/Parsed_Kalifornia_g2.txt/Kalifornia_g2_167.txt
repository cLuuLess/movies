               adele is still rambling on about her interest in cacti.

                         ...there ain't nothin' can kill 'em. 
                         they can live for two even three 
                         hundred years.

                         adele for god sake please lis...

                                     adele
                              (she glances over to 
                              brian)
                         there ain't nothing we could do. 
                         once early sets his mind on somethin', 
                         well thats the end of that.

               adele drifts back to the cacti.
