               int. early and adele's motel bathroom room - same time

               the tap is running at the sink as early empties the stolen 
               purse. he adds the last few coins to a small pile of cash.

                                     early
                         can you believe thirty bucks for 
                         this room... for what? a lumpy 
                         mattress, that crummy tv and a 
                         crapper.

                         early, sing me a song.

               early continues to sift through all the items from the purse.

                                     early
                         which one.
