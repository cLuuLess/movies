               int. living room

               early looks through several more photos. he stops on one of 
               a nude woman's torso. early looks at it for a moment... then 
               extends the photo out toward carrie, comparing it to her.

                                     early
                              (smiles and shakes 
                              his head in disbelief)
                         that's you ain't it?

               carrie doesn't answer him. then, in the background directly 
               behind early... adele and mrs. musgrave quietly appear. carrie 
               notices them as they start to cross the hallway to the 
               kitchen. early sees carrie's eyes glance past him. he turns 
               to see why... when...

                                     carrie (o.s.)
                         you're right early...

               early stops. looks back to carrie. brian also turns to her 
               curiously.

                                     carrie
                         ...it is me. do you like it?

               early looks at the photo again. adele and mrs. musgrave now 
               cross safely to the kitchen. carrie eyes meet early's. he 
               smiles, pulls the nude photo of her close to his face... and 
               licks it.
