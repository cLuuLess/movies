               ext. old mine building

               the old mine building, rusted and deserted since the late 
               '20's.

                                     early
                         so tell me... what happened here?

                                     brian
                         two brothers, prospectors, lived 
                         here. up until a few years back.

               flash! -- early takes a photo with the instamatic.

                                     early
                              (coaxing)
                         ...and?

                                     brian
                         they picked up hitchhikers... young 
                         men... and brought them back here.

               early scans the grounds.

                                     early
                         where'd they do it?

               reluctantly brian leads early toward the old mine building. 
               at the opening, early hesitates.

                                     early
                         bri.

               brian stops in his tracks.
