               early driving. adele in the passenger seat looks bewildered. 
               carrie and brian in back, handcuffed, eyes hollow with 
               exhaustion and fear. then out of the quiet...

                                     early
                         i'm still waiting.

               adele looks across the seat to early. her face drained of 
               all expression.

                                     early
                              (disappointed)
                         not so much as a simple "thank you."

               adele at a loss. finally... confused...

                                     adele
                              (empty)
                         ...thank you.

                                     early
                         thank you for what?
                              (becoming aggravated)
                         what are you thanking me for adele?

                                     adele
                              (hesitantly, she admits)
                         ...i don't know.

                                     early
                         well adele... it was for...
                              (screaming at her)
                         ...saving your fucking life back 
                         there!

               she shrinks away from him.

                                     early
                              (gesturing with his 
                              fingertips a fraction 
                              apart)
                         darlin' you were 'bout that far from 
                         spendin' the night at the morgue. 
                         you understand?

                                     carrie
                         he wasn't going to shoot her, you 
                         murdering son of a bitch!

               early looks into the rear-view mirror. brian tries to defuse 
               the situation.

                                     brian
                         carrie... stop it.

                                     carrie
                              (explodes)
                         what the fuck is wrong with you 
                         brian!? if you'll stop taking notes 
                         for once and open your eyes... you'll 
                         see that he is a homicidal fucking 
                         killer. he is... for real!

                                     brian
                         shut up carrie, please... just shut 
                         up!
