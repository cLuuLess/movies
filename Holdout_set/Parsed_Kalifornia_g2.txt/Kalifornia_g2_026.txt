               int. grand prix

               early tries to get the engine to tick over. then... he sees 
               john diebold, his landlord, emerge from his house and begin 
               lumbering toward the grand prix. the two panting ugly-ass 
               pitbulls trot alongside their master.

                                     diebold
                              (shouts)
                         hold on a minute there boy!

                                     early
                         shit!

               early tries the engine again. still won't start. diebold, 
               getting closer. the dogs are barking.

                                     diebold
                         goddamit, you're gonna settle up 
                         that rent here and now.

               hurriedly, early tries the engine one more time. it starts. 
               grinning from ear to ear, early pulls away before diebold 
               and his dogs reach him.

               pissed, diebold grabs a rock and hurls it, hitting early's 
               car.

               the car stops, dead in its tracks.

                                     diebold
                         i've had it with your bullshit boy. 
                         i want my money.
