               ext. early's trailer - later

               police and firemen sift through the smoking ruins of early's 
               trailer. the parole officer pulls up in his car, he gets out 
               and approaches a police officer.

                                     parole officer
                         what happened?

                                     police officer
                         who are you?

                                     parole officer
                         his parole officer.

                                     police officer
                         right, i talked to you on the phone. 
                         they say it's a torch job, that sound 
                         like your boy?

                                     parole officer
                         could be.

                                     police officer
                         where would we find him?

                                     parole officer
                         hell if i know, crazy son of a bitch 
                         said he was thinking of moving to 
                         texas.

                                     police officer
                         without his car?

               we see the smoldering remains of early's grand prix. in the 
               background diebold's pitbulls are being dragged away by a 
               dog wrangler.

                                     police officer
                         what about the owner of the house...
                              (reads from note pad)
                         ...this john diebold, any idea where 
                         he might be?

                                     parole officer
                         no, but i can tell you he's not gonna 
                         be too happy about this.

               from inside early's hole we hear a voice call out.

                                     laborer (o.s.)
                         jesus christ!

               parole officer and police officer turn back toward the 
               trailer, as people rush to the site.

               new angle - overhead

               the camera aerials down past those gathering around the 
               freshly dug hole to... a laborer standing at the bottom of 
               the pit. alongside his shovel, we see that a man's arm has 
               been unearthed.

               low angle up to the top of the hole

               the police and parole officer join several others standing 
               there.

                                     parole officer
                         ...diebold?

                                     police officer
                         ...that'd be my guess.

                                     parole officer
                         looks like somebody cut off his ring 
                         finger.

                                     police officer
                         well now i'd say that's the least of 
                         mr. diebold's problems.

               the two men look to one another... as others begin to unearth 
               the body.
