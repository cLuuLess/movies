                         ...of the fatal stabbing and robbery 
                         of mr. joseph davies robbins...

               new angle on carrie

               she stares at the tv with growing horror as she notices a 
               familiar black lincoln in the background. in mid-ground, a 
               male figure approaches the video camera unknowingly. slowly, 
               early's image becomes visible.

                         if you see this man...

               carrie panics, turns toward the door and runs smack into the 
               arms of a dripping wet early grayce! early stares at her and 
               drops his bag to the ground.

                                     early
                         i ain't ridin' in no bus... bitch.

               then... early notices himself on the tv.

                                     newscaster (o.s.)
                         ...call your local police or fbi...

               static.

               early grabs carrie around the neck and yanks her into the 
               back office. he pushes her down onto a chair.

                                     early
                         you just sit there and keep your 
                         mouth shut.

               he searches behind the cash register and finds a sawed-off 
               shotgun. he shuts the tv off.

                                     early
                         i knew that boy'd have a hogleg here 
                         somewhere.

               the attendant rushes back in from the pouring rain. early 
               points the sawed-off shotgun at him.

                                     early
                         get over here.

               early forces him into the office.

                                     early
                         sit your ass down in that corner.

               adele enters the adjacent room. she checks out the various 
               vending machines in search of candy. early taps on the window 
               and motions her into the office. she sees carrie in the chair, 
               scared to death, and early aiming the gun at the attendant.

                                     adele
                         early, what're you doin'?

                                     early
                         go back to the car and keep brian 
                         there. i don't want him in here...
                              (beat)
                         do it adele... now!

               adele looks back at carrie, then hurries out. early empties 
               the cash register.

                                     early
                         what's your name, boy?

                                     attendant
                              (very scared)
                         walter livesy.

                                     early
                         think. i might just have to kill you 
                         walter. how do you feel about that?

                                     attendant
                         not so good. you sure you have to?

                                     early
                         i don't know. wish i did.

                                     carrie
                         early, just think...

                                     early
                         shut your mouth.
