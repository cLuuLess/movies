               int. study - glass display case

               early leans into frame, staring at the display case.

               early's pov

               inside of it is a four foot long replica of the first atomic 
               bomb, "fat boy." faded newspaper articles on the wall indicate 
               mr. musgrave had something to do with the bomb's initial 
               construction. an old photo on the bookshelf shows a much 
               younger mr. musgrave in a '50's kitchen. he is laughing and 
               embracing a '50's style female mannequin.

                                     mr. musgrave (o.s.)
                         my oh my, this is quite rare, quite 
                         rare indeed. come have a look...

               early's eyes drift over to a set of golf clubs that sit in 
               the corner of the room.

               mr musgrave's pov - through telescope

               the planet saturn and its glorious rings.

                                     mr. musgrave (o.s.)
                         peaches?

               omitted

               thwack!! the planet turns into a blur of light... then 
               blackness.
