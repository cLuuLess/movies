               ext. construction site - night

               emerging from the blackness... the same strong male hands 
               that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket 
               clear of his torso. a crude bandage wrapped around one of 
               the fingers. the rock is slipped up under his jacket... up 
               against his bare chest. the jacket is pulled down to conceal 
               the rock and the faceless figure drifts away.
