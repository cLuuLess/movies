               int. brian and carrie's room - same time

               brian has turned on the nightstand light. he and carrie are 
               lying in bed.

                                     brian
                         ...and all i'm saying is i think we 
                         ought to try and get along with them. 
                         that's all.

                                     carrie
                         you try, i'm gonna pretend they're 
                         with somebody else.

                                     brian
                         carrie.

                                     carrie
                         i don't want to talk about it.

               brian turns the light off. from the blackness...

                                     carrie
                         pretty smooth how he stiffed us on 
                         dinner?

               brian switches the light back on.

                                     brian
                         he didn't stiff us. he paid for the 
                         gas remember.

               silence... brian reaches out for the light... when

                                     carrie
                         i'm telling you he's nearly broke 
                         and we're going to end up paying for 
                         those two.

               brian decides to leave the light on. he moves closer to 
               carrie. he slides up against her backside. he reaches for 
               her under the sheets. kisses her neck.

                                     brian
                         you finished?

               carrie pushes her body up against his in response.

                                     carrie
                         ...um, maybe... maybe not.

               brian's mouth moves down along her back. he slips beneath 
               the sheets. from the expression on her face, she obviously 
               approves... yet she can't resist slipping in another remark...

                                     carrie
                         ...um... funky fucking sock.

               carrie rolls over on her back. brian moves on top of her. 
               kisses her stomach.

                                     carrie
                         ...and what's with that hair? is 
                         that grease or motor oil or what?

               carrie reaches down and grabs two fists full of brian's hair. 
               she pulls him to her. he slides up along her chest, kissing 
               her. things heat up. she reaches out, grasps his arms. pulls 
               him closer.

                                     carrie
                         ...you believe that tattoo? looks 
                         like he had another girls name there 
                         and carved it out.

               brian bites at her neck. she stops talking. his sweating 
               shoulder presses against her face. she turns her head to 
               encourage him.

               in the dresser mirror... she sees their shadowy reflections. 
               their bodies atangle under the sheets.

                                     carrie
                         ...and that body odor.

               their reflection in the mirror intrigues her. intoxicates 
               her. his aggression excites her. she pulls him into her. the 
               metal bedframe bangs against the motel wall repeatedly as 
               they make love.

               then slowly, the camera bisects the plaster and lumber divider 
               and emerges in the next room...

               to find

               early leaning quietly against the same wall. listening to 
               them. as he does, he uses the scissors to cut through the 
               crusty bandage on his finger. then, across the room he notices 
               adele in bed asleep... the scissors stop.
