               int. 70's chevy

               the girl pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. she 
               looks curiously to the driver whose hand is trembling 
               slightly.

                                     pretty teenage girl
                         what's the matter?

                                     driver
                              (unconvincingly)
                         ...nothing.

               the girl reaches out, steadies his trembling hand... and 
               pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips.

               when... in a thunderous crash!! the glistening wet rock comes 
               smashing through their windshield!!!!
