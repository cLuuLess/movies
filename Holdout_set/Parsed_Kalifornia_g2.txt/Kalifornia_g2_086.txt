               brian walks around the lincoln; checking the tires. carrie 
               watches early intently.

               close on early

               he walks toward the entrance.

               his pov

               inside the store he sees a video surveillance camera. it 
               worries him. distracts him momentarily.

               suddenly from behind him... o.s. a car horn honks loudly!

               early turns to see a late model mercedes behind him. he just 
               gazes at the driver. aggravated, the driver leans on the 
               horn and motions early out of his way. early stares at the 
               man a moment longer, then steps to one side and lets the car 
               pull past him.

               wide on the gas station

               a fat man in his late thirties exits from behind the wheel 
               of the mercedes. early watches him as he takes a money clip 
               from his pocket and walks toward the entrance to the mini 
               market.
