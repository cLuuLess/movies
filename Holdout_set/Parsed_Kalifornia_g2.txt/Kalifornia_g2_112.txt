               ext. the bowling alley bar

               early and brian exit the bar. they make their way to the 
               lincoln. on the way...

                                     early
                         got to see a man about a mule.

               brian looks at early, doesn't understand.

                                     early
                         gotta take a piss.

               early branches off behind the car.

                                     early
                         any reebs left in the back seat?

               early starts to take a leak.

                                     early
                         aaahhhhh...
                              (relief)
                         that's what we used to call a beer 
                         when we was kids... beer spelled 
                         backwards.

               brian reaches in the back seat and grabs the last lucky lager. 
               he crosses to the other side of the car and hands early the 
               beer.

                                     brian
                         last one.

               early stares at the last of the lucky lagers.

                                     early
                         ...well i probably drunk more than 
                         my share, anyway... you go on an' 
                         have it.

                                     brian
                         no, it's all yours. it's on me... 
                         for saving my ass back there.

               early takes the beer.

                                     early
                         hey, that's what buddies are for, 
                         right...?

               early polishes off the rest of the bottle and heaves it into 
               the woods.

                                     early
                              (voice drops almost 
                              to a whisper)
                         you know those doors i was talking 
                         about? found two of them back in 
                         kentucky. shit, i wasn't even looking 
                         for one the first time. me and the 
                         boys are just swingin' our sickles 
                         by the side of the road, and i turned 
                         around and there it was... this door 
                         with this bright blinding white light 
                         all around it... course i'm thinkin' 
                         i must be sunstroked or somethin'... 
                         so i close my eyes figurin' i'll 
                         count ten and it'll be gone right... 
                         so i'm countin'...
                              (he closes his eyes)
                         ...1-2-3-4-5... an' i'm 'bout ta 
                         piss myself right... -6-7-8-9... 10. 
                         an' i open my eyes slow, spectin' it 
                         won't be there right...

               when early opens his eyes, he sees a concerned look on brian's 
               face.

                                     early
                              (unconvincingly)
                         ...and it wasn't.

               an awkward silence.

               then early starts laughing. brian follows suit. they both 
               climb back in the car. their forced laughter trails off.

               brian shifts the lincoln back into gear and segues 
               awkwardly...

                                     brian
                         what were you "swinging a sickle" 
                         for?

               early stares at brian. for a moment brian is unsure what 
               early will say, or do? then early grins...

                                     early
                         for... 'bout three years.

               brian brakes their eye contact, looks back out onto the 
               highway and just drives off.
