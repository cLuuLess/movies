               ext. musgrave house - night

               everything is quiet beneath the star studded sky. the same 
               elderly man pictured with mrs. musgrave is studying the sky 
               through a powerful telescope. mr. musgrave is an amateur 
               astronomer. o.s. the sound of a door opening. then footsteps.

                                     mr. musgrave
                              (excited)
                         is that you peaches? come, you must 
                         see saturn tonight. the rings are 
                         sensational!
