     ext. a street nearby

     christy and mary robert walk along a street a few blocks 
     from the convent.

                               mary robert
                             (looking around 
                             cautiously)
               are you sure this is what reverend 
               mother had in mind?

                               christy
               i know it is.  it's life.  experience.  
               take a deep breath.

     christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop.  she 
     spins, letting her habit billow around her.

                               mary robert
                             (shocked)
               mary clarence!

                               christy
               now you.

     mary robert's eyes widen.  she points to herself -- "me?" 
     christy nods.  mary robert lets out a tiny little whoop, 
     and does a little, timid hop.

                               christy
               it's a start.
