     christy is making her way past a roulette table.  
     suddenly, she sees joey coming toward her, making his way 
     through the crowd.  christy grabs the arm of a salesman 
     playing roulette.

                               croupier
               place your bets. 

                               christy
                             (to the salesman)
               red 21.

                               salesman
               you sure?  how do you know?

     christy looks up to heaven.

                               salesman
                             (to the croupier)
               red 21.

     joey stands at the opposite side of the roulette table, 
     glaring at christy.  the crowd around the table watches 
     christy for a moment, then they all put their chips down on 
     red 21.

     joey starts working his way around the table toward 
     christy as the croupier spins the wheel.  the ball falls 
     into a slot.

                               croupier
               black 14.

     everyone at the table turns toward christy, outraged.  she 
     gives them a reprimanding look.

                               christy
               did you learn something?

     christy suddenly realizes that joey is almost at her side. 
     she shoves the salesman against him and runs away.
