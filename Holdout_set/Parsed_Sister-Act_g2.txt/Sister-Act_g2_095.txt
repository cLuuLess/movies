     henry parker waits for the elevator.  when it opens, he's 
     surprised to see eddie step out.

                               parker
               tate said you were gone.

                               eddie
               i get all the way down to my car, and, 
               of course -- where are the keys?

                               parker
               i left the money vouchers with him.  he 
               said you'd sign them in the morning.

     eddie nods and moves on as parker enters the elevator. 
     after a few steps, eddie suddenly looks disturbed.  he 
     picks up his pace.  a little panicky, he begins to jog 
     toward the squad room.
