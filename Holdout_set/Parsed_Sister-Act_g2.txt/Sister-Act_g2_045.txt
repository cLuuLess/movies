     int. bathing room

     a stone room that is very medieval-looking.  one wall is 
     divided into stalls by wooden partitions.  in each stall is 
     a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a 
     thin stream of lukewarm water.  we see only the nuns' heads 
     and shoulders.

     still sleepy, christy leans against the wall of her stall, 
     her eyes closed.  lost in thought, she begins singing 
     softly to herself.

                               christy
               my boyfriend's back
               and you're gonna be in trouble

                               a few other nuns
                             (very softly)
               hey-la, hey-la

     christy looks up from her reverie; she looks around.  the 
     other nuns are bathing, their eyes down.  there is no sign 
     of singing.  christy decides to try a test.

                               christy
               my boyfriend's back
               he's gonna save my reputation

                               a few of the nuns
                             (still very softly)
               hey-la, hey-la

                               christy
               if i were you,
               i'd take a permanent vacation

                               a few of the nuns
               hey-la, hey-la
               my boyfriend's back

     the nuns giggle.

                               christy
               where did that come from?

                               mary patrick
               i haven't heard that song in ages.  the 
               ronettes?

                               mary lazarus
                             (very grouchy)
               shirelles.

                               christy
               you know that song?

                               mary patrick
               1961?  '62?  mary clarence, that's when 
               many of us took final vows.  it's the 
               last secular music we recall.

                               christy
               no.
               hey -- he knows that you been creating
               now you're gonna get a beating

                               all the nuns
               hey-la, hey la

                               mary lazarus
                             (cutting off the song)
               that's enough.  we've got to get to 
               chapel.

     mary lazarus leaves the bathing room, and the other nuns 
     resume scrubbing themselves.  christy looks around.

                               christy
               anybody got conditioner?
