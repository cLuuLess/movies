     int. rehearsal room

     several members of the choir rush into the room with panic 
     in their eyes.

                               mary patrick
               mary clarence!  sister!

                               mary robert
               it's no use.  she just isn't here.

                               mary patrick
               it doesn't make any sense.  she was 
               right behind me...

     the horn on the school bus blows loudly down in the 
     street.

                               mary robert
               we can't sing without her!  what should 
               we do?

                               mary patrick
                             (calming herself)
               we'll pray -- and she'll be there.

     the nuns are calmed by the tone of mary patrick's voice. 
     they leave the room to join the others on the bus.
