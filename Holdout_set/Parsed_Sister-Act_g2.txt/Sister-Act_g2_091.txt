     int. mother superior's office - day

     seated at her desk, mother superior glances up as christy 
     enters.

                               christy
               you sent for me?

                               mother superior
               you have a phone call.

     mother superior continues with her paperwork as christy 
     picks up the phone.

                               christy
               hello?

                               eddie's voice
               good news, kid.  i pulled a few strings 
               the judge has agreed to move the trial
               up.  we'll be in court in a couple of 
               days.

     with mixed emotions, christy speaks softly.

                               christy
               that soon?

     mother superior is a very interested eavesdropper.

                               eddie's voice
               forty-eight hours -- and you'll be a 
               free woman.

                               christy
               great.  that's good to hear.

                               eddie's voice
               hey, don't thank me or anything.

                               christy
               right, right -- thanks.

     christy hangs up the phone.  she looks at mother superior.

                               christy
               hey -- your prayers have been answered.  
               i'm leaving.  in just a couple of days.

                               mother superior
               really.  well, that makes two of us.

                               christy
               what?

                               mother superior
               i have submitted my resignation to 
               bishop o'hara.  privately.  i have asked 
               to be relocated as soon as possible.

                               christy
               but -- why?

                               mother superior
               i must go where i can be of use.

                               christy
               but -- there's so much more to do right 
               here.  and look, if it's about me, i 
               mean, i'm gone.

                               mother superior
               indeed.  after how long?  a few weeks?  
               i have been here thirty years.  and yet, 
               it would seem, i know nothing.

                               christy
               but everything that's happening is good!  
               you can be a part of it!

                               mother superior
               a part of what?  mary clarence, it is 
               one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into 
               town and declare a holiday.  you have 
               raised the sisters' expectations, you 
               have excited and confused them.  they 
               imagine this neighborhood to be some sort 
               of delightful ongoing block party.

                               mother superior (cont'd)
               you and i know that life is not so 
               simple.  there will be disappointments.  
               rude shocks.  and you will have vanished.  
               how... fortunate.

                               christy
               okay, so i just got things started.  but 
               you could build on that.  you could keep 
               it going.

                               mother superior
               i am sorry, mary clarence.  i seem to 
               have misplaced my tambourine.  good day, 
               mary clarence.

                               christy
               but...

                               mother superior
               good day.

     christy, frustrated, leaves the room.  mother superior 
     looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her 
     choices.
