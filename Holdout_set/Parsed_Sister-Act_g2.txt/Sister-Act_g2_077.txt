     mother superior is livid.

                               mother superior
               gospel.  a jazz solo on the organ.  what 
               next?  jesus goes to rio?  good friday-a-
               go-go?  what were you thinking?

                               christy
               i was thinking las vegas.  get some 
               butts in those seats.

                               mother superior
               and what next?  popcorn?  curtain calls?  
               this is not a theater.  or a casino.

                               christy
                             (sincerely)
               exactly.  people like going to theaters 
               and casinos.  but they think church is 
               for grandma -- we could change that. pack 
               the joint.

                               mother superior
               through blasphemy?  you have corrupted 
               the entire choir!

                               christy
               hold on.  that's not fair.  i worked 
               hard with them.  they gave up their free 
               time, and they loved it.  those women are 
               happy.  and we can get even better.  we 
               can wake this place up.

                               mother superior
               out of the question.

                               christy
               please let me try.  i'm begging you.

                               mother superior
               and i am refusing.  as of tomorrow, mary 
               lazarus will resume her leadership of
               the choir.

     christy is crestfallen.  there is a knock on the door, and 
     o'hara enters.  the other members of the choir are in 
     behind him like sardines.

                               bishop o'hara
               reverend mother, i just wanted to 
               congratulate you.

                               mother superior
               oh?

                               bishop o'hara
               i haven't enjoyed mass this much in 
               years.  what a marvelous program. 
               innovative.  inspiring.  you are to be 
               commended.

                               mother superior
               well... thank you.

                               bishop o'hara
               i can't wait until next sunday, when the 
               choir performs again.  did you see the
               people walk right in from the street? 
               that music, that heavenly music -- it 
               called to them.

                               mother superior
               perhaps.

                               bishop o'hara
               i must tell the cardinal.  i.11 send him 
               a personal letter, describing your
               efforts, your bold new fight to keep 
               your little convent alive.

                               mother superior
               really?

     christy has just been eating this up with a spoon.

                               christy
               excuse me, bishop.  reverend mother has 
               some other ideas too.  she's too modest 
               to talk about it, but she thinks we 
               should get out of the convent and into 
               the neighborhood more.
                             (putting her hands on 
                             mother superior's 
                             shoulders) 
               this woman.

     mary patrick jumps forward.

                               mary patrick
               bless her!  there are so many problems 
               in this neighborhood that we could help 
               solve.  that's why many of us became 
               nuns.  it's marvelous, reverend mother.

                               mother superior
                             (confused by the turn 
                             things have taken)
               really...

                               christy
                             (with regard to mother 
                             superior)
               you know reverend mother.  hides her 
               light under a bushel.  she has plans for 
               us to move right onto the streets.  get 
               to know people.  work with 'em.

                               bishop o'hara
                             (to mother superior)
               you're a pioneer.

                               mother superior
               but, bishop, surely you realize -- this 
               is a most dangerous neighborhood.

                               o'hara
               and you'll face that danger head-on.  as 
               if i could stop you.  and you have my 
               complete support in this matter. anything 
               you can do to revitalize this 
               neighborhood would be a blessing.

                               christy
                             (hugging mother 
                             superior from behind)
               don't you love her?
