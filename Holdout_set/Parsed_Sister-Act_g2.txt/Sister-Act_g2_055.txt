     int. mother superior's office

     christy is on the phone in the darkened office.  she keeps 
     checking the door, to make sure no one is listening.

                               christy
                             (into phone)
               let me talk to detective eddie mulcahy.  
               it's an emergency.  real bad.

                               eddie's voice
               mulcahy.

     christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly 
     and frantically.  intercut between christy and eddie.

                               christy
               eddie, you've got to get me out of here.

                               eddie
               not again.  you can't keep calling. 
               somebody's going to catch on to where you 
               are.

                               christy
               but i'm going insane!  all these people 
               do is pray and work, work and pray!  i 
               don't get it -- when's the weekend? they 
               have gruel, eddie, that's what they call 
               food!  gruel -- it's like alpo for nuns!  
               i sleep in a cell, on a board, and i pray 
               five times a days  do you know what i 
               pray for, eddie, do you have any idea?  
               check your crotch, eddie --anything fall 
               off yet?  get me outta her!

                               eddie
               calm down.  look, i didn't want to tell 
               you this, but we've had some problems 
               with our protection program lately.

                               christy
               like what?

                               eddie
               keeping our witnesses alive.  we hide 
               them, but there's a leak in the 
               department, and they end up dead.

                               christy
               you son-of-a-bitch!

                               eddie
               i just need a few more weeks,

                               christy
               but it's a nightmare!  mother superior 
               is out to get me!  she hates my guts! she 
               keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!

     in the distance, christy hears the choir practicing; they 
     sound even worse than usual.

                               christy
                             (holding the phone 
                             out)
               do you hear that?  that choir?  eddie, 
               in here, that's what they call music!

                               eddie
               don't call again.  it's not safe.  i'll 
               be in touch.

     as the line goes dead, mother superior enters.  christy 
     takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver. she 
     sings as she works.

                               christy
               the hills are alive with the sound of 
               music...

     still singing, christy breezes out of the room.  mother 
     superior looks mystified.
