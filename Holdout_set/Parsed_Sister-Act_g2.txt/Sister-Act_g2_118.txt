     ext. alley - day

     joey and willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of 
     their car.  they shove christy and mary robert into the 
     back seat, and willy climbs in next to them.

                               willy
               go!

     joey starts the car, and it takes off with squealing 
     tires.  willy has his gun pointed at christy, who sits 
     beside mary robert.

                               mary robert
               but what do they want?  where are we 
               going?

                               christy
                             (to joey and willy)
               she's got nothing to do with this.  let 
               her go.

                               joey
               yeah, right to the cops.  no way.

                               christy
               mary robert, don't panic.  remember what 
               we talked about?  experience?

                               joey
               what?

                               christy
                             (quickly, to mary 
                             robert)
               you can handle this.

     the car comes to a stop at an intersection.  christy 
     reaches across mary robert and opens the car door.  she 
     shoves mary robert into the street.

                               christy
               go!

     mary robert executes a perfect somersault onto the 
     sidewalk.  she looks to heaven, crosses herself and runs 
     back to the cathedral.

     willy grabs christy before she can escape.

                               joey
               she's gettin' away!

                               willy
               forget her!  we got the one we need! 
               step on it!

     joey takes off again.
