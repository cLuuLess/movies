     int. st. matthew's cathedral - day

     in the rehearsal room, mary robert has just finished 
     telling the nuns what happened to christy.

                               mary patrick
               you mean -- they kidnapped her?

                               mary robert
               yes -- two men -- and they had guns.

                               mother superior
               she shouldn't have come back.  she knew 
               she was in danger.

                               mary patrick
               but -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?

                               mary lazarus
               were they catholics?

     mother superior suddenly steps forward.

                               mother superior
               she isn't a nun.  her real name is 
               christy van cartier, and she is a 
               professional entertainer.  she witnessed 
               a vicious crime, and has been hiding in 
               our convent.

     the nuns all react with shock and emotion.

                               mary robert
               an... entertainer?

                               mary patrick
               she wasn't a nun? 

                               another nun
               she lied to us?

                               mary robert
               but... but... she was such a wonderful 
               nun.

                               mary patrick
               look what she did with the choir.  she 
               made us sing beautifully.

                               mary lazarus
               that should have tipped us.

                               mary robert
               well, i don't care who she is.  we can't 
               sing without her!

                               mary patrick
               she's our inspiration!

                               mary lazarus
               she's the act!

                               mary robert
               reverend mother, i know that you and 
               mary clarence didn't always agree, but --
               we've got to help her.

                               mary patrick
               we've got to save her!

                               mary lazarus
               we can't leave it up to the feds!

     the nuns all look to mother superior for an answer.

                               mother superior
               calm down.  think clearly.  mary robert, 
               do you have any idea who those men were?

                               mary robert
               she said they were from her old convent.

                               mother superior
               but... she was a showgirl.  she didn't 
               have an old convent.

                               mary patrick
               she told us about one.  the little 
               sisters of the moonlight.  in las vegas.

                               mother superior
               all right.  it's a beginning.  las 
               vegas, nevada.

     all the nuns hurriedly cross themselves.

                               mother superior
               mary lazarus, find the bishop and tell 
               him the situation.  everyone else --
               follow me.

     mother superior leads the way out the door.
