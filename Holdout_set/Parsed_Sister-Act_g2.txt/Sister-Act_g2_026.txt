     christy is huddled in a chair, surrounded by eddie and two 
     other detectives, clarkson and tate.

                               christy
               right between the eyes!  down and out! 
               the guy was gone!  i... i couldn't 
               believe it!

                               eddie
               you couldn't believe it?  vince the 
               prince?

                               christy
               i never said he was an altar boy, okay?  
               but he sent his goons after me!  they 
               tried to kill me!  i'm not kidding!

                               clarkson
               tough break.  whoa.

                               eddie
               what did you expect?  vince is as dirty 
               as they come.  we've been finding bodies 
               around here for years.

                               christy
               i don't know anything about bodies!  i 
               mean, he didn't bring it home.  he was 
               good to me... sometimes.  he was sweet. 
               he took care of me.  who am i supposed to 
               go out with?  he owns a casino.  he let 
               me sing.

                               eddie
               he didn't do you a favor.

                               christy
               screw you!

                               tate
               come on, she'll sing great.  when she 
               sings for us.

                               christy
               sing -- like testify?  are you nuts?  i 
               just want you to protect me!  you're 
               cops!

                               tate
               busy cops.  we don't have time to be 
               bodyguards for anyone who comes in here 
               with some cockamamie story.  mink coats 
               and laundry chutes.

                               clarkson
               unless, of course, you're willing to 
               testify.

     page 17.

                               christy
               what is this, some squeeze play?  can't 
               you just protect me without any strings?

     the three detectives move in closer now and really apply 
     the pressure.

                               eddie
               we could put you into our witness 
               protection program.

                               tate
               a hiding place. 

                               clarkson
               a new identity.

                               eddie
               but you'd have to agree to testify.  the 
               whole nine yards.

                               christy
               and if i don't?

                               eddie
               then-you run.

                               tate
               you wait.

                               clarkson
               you listen for the footsteps.

                               eddie
               then one day they find you.

                               tate
               they open a window.

                               clarkson
               it's ten flights up.

                               tate
               ten flights down.

                               christy
               ten flights?

                               eddie
               you'd lose.  you'd die.  all over the 
               sidewalk.  and into the street.

                               christy
               all right!  i get the picture!  i'll do 
               it!  i'll testify!

                               eddie
                             (to tate) 
               get a stenographer.

     page 18.

     tate leaves.  christy looks to eddie for a bargain now.

                               christy
               okay, here's what i want.  i know about 
               this stuff.  a five-star hotel.  with 
               room service.

                               eddie
               maybe hawaii.

                               clarkson
               diamond head.

                               christy
               yeah.  and i'll need a new look.  like a 
               disguise.

                               eddie
               maybe armani.

                               clarkson
               no -- calvin klein.

                               christy
               for sportswear.  and a limo.  and my 
               hair -- up?

                               clarkson
               it could work.

                               eddie
               jesus, what do you think this is --
               wheel of fortune?  let me spell it out 
               for you.  you have to hide like you don't 
               even exist.  you have to get so far 
               hidden away that you never see sunlight.

                               christy
                             (confused)
               okay -- no limo.

                               eddie
               no nothing.

                               christy
               what're you gonna do, put me in a bag 
               and bury me?

                               eddie
               i'm gonna put you in the last place on 
               earth that vince would ever look for you.

     eddie smiles.  christy doesn't like the sound of this at 
     all a

     page 19.
