     int. blackjack area

     as christy moves past a blackjack game, she suddenly sees 
     vince moving toward her.  turning quickly, she moves away 
     from vince, but suddenly sees joey coming toward her from 
     the opposite direction.  trapped for a moment, she has 
     panic in her eyes.  suddenly she is flanked by mother 
     superior and mary patrick.

                               christy
               what are you doing here?

                               mother superior
               saving you.  move!

     the nuns surround christy and head through the crowd in a 
     cluster.  joey and vince pursue them from different 
     directions.  just before they catch them, mother superior 
     barks an order.

                               mother superior
               break!

     the nuns split up, each taking a different direction. 
     vince and joey look bewildered.

                               vince
               get her!

                               joey
               which one!

                               vince
               the nun!

     vince, joey and willy each pick a nun and follow her.

     vince catches up to a nun, whom we only see from the rear. 
     he grabs her shoulder.

                               vince
               babe.

     the nun spins around; it is mother superior.

                               mother superior
               sweetheart.

     vince releases her and frantically searches the crowd 
     again.

     joey catches up with his nun, only to find it is mary 
     patrick.  the shell game has worked; christy has escaped 
     for the moment.
