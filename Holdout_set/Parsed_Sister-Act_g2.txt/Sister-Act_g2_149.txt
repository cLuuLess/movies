     int. chapel

     the chapel is packed to the rafters.  the first few rows 
     of pews are occupied by cardinals.  television cameras 
     glide up and down the aisles, angling for shots of the 
     altar.

     the choir stands together on the altar with christy in 
     front. behind them stands a much larger, all-city choir. 
     christy gives the nod to sister alma, and the organ vamp 
     begins.

                               mary robert
               i was downhearted

                               christy
               it's true!

                               mary robert
               i was hell-bound, 
               yes that's what they say
               satan was waiting

                               christy
               don't you know it!

                               mary robert
               but the lord came to me

                               christy
               what did he say?

                               mary robert
               he said, sing the devil away!

                               mary patrick
               my soul was in danger
               i'd fallen from grace

                               christy
               it's true -- i know her.

                               mary patrick
               damnation was all i could see

                               christy
               what a shame!

                               mary patrick
               but then came an angel
               who whispered these words

                               christy
               pay attention...

                               mary patrick
               sing and the devil will flee!

                               christy
               were you wicked?

                               choir
               sing!

                               christy
               were you tempted?

                               choir
               sing!
               sing and your spirit will soar!

     in the front row, mother superior is trying to resist the 
     music.  she gives in, and starts bobbing her head to the 
     beat.  beside her, eddie looks very proud as his eyes meet 
     christy's.

                               christy
               but i'm fearful!

                               choir
               sing!

                               christy
               and i'm tearful!

                               choir
               sing!

                               christy
               yes i'll sing and know joy evermore

                               christy/choir
               do your troubles bind you
               if yoo're deep in woe
               you can banish gloom if you try
               find a song within you
               let it fill your days
               just sing

                               mary robert
               sing!

               just sing!

                               christy
               sing!

                               christy/choir
               sing and say devil, goodbye!

     the entire congregation is ecstatic, as the song concludes 
     with a glorious final flourish.
