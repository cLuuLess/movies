     ext. san francisco airport - night

     several small planes are parked on the tarmac.

     mother superior and the nuns are arguing with the manager 
     of the airport, a grouchy guy in grease-stained overalls.

                               manager
               fifteen hundred for the run to vegas. 
               rock-bottom.

                               mary patrick
               but we don't have fifteen hundred!

                               mary robert
               we're nuns!

     the manager starts back toward his office.

                               manager
               can't help you.  no exceptions.

                               mother superior
               young man!

     page 102.

     the voice has a powerful ring of authority to it, and the 
     manager looks around.

                               manager
               what?

                               mother superior 
               we are nuns.  we pray.

                               manager
               so?

                               mother superior
               we pray for good things.  food for the 
               hungry.

                               mary patrick
               peace on earth.

                               mother superior
               however, we can also pray for other 
               things.

                               mary patrick
               measles.

                               mary robert
               lawsuits.

                               mary lazarus
               tax audits.

     there is a pause, as the manager stares at the nuns in 
     horror.

                               mother superior
               come, sisters.  let's go to chapel.  
               bring your beads.

     the nuns begin to leave.

                               manager
               wait!
