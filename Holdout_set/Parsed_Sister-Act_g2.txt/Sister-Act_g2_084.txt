     int. eddie's apartment - night

     eddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and 
     watching the news on tv at the same time.  he pours himself 
     a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce.

               this tiny convent has experienced an 
               amazing turnaround.  the sisters have 
               revitalized and taken back their 
               neighborhood, all due to the energy and 
               talent of the convent choir, a group led 
               by this gifted young nun.  tell us, mary 
               clarence1 what makes you so special?

                               christy
                             (trying to appear 
                             modest and nun-like)
               oh, i'm not special, bob.  it's just 
               hard work... and prayer.

     eddie all but spits out his wine.  his eyes are wide as he 
     watches christy being interviewed.  in one stride, he grabs 
     his hat and coat and is out the door on the run.
