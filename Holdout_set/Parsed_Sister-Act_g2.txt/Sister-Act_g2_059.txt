     ext. social club

     a neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer 
     signs.  the exterior is colorfully painted; the club all 
     but explodes with good times.  a group of teenagers lounge 
     on the steps, sipping beers and smoking.  among the 
     teenagers are the girls from christy's christian youth 
     group.  christy and mary robert approach, and the group 
     falls silent.

                               christy
               how are you doing.

                               lawanda
                             (puzzled)
               hey, sisters.  are you going in there?

                               christy
               you know it.

                               mary robert
               we need experience.

                               christy
                             (remembering she's a 
                             nun)
               it's part of st. katherine's new 
               community outreach program.  how old are 
               you?  you shouldn't be smoking.  have you 
               ever seen a diseased lung?  hand 'em 
               over.

     lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes.  christy 
     turns to a teenage boy who's drinking beer.

                               christy
               and you, with the devil's brew passing 
               through your lips.
                             (holding out her hand)
               a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

     the boy hands over the beer.  christy and mary robert 
     enter the club.
