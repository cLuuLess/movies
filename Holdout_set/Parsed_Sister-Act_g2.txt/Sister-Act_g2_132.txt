     eddie strides out of the airport; he took a later flight 
     than the nuns.  a squad car is waiting; clarkson beckons 
     him.

                               clarkson
               lieutenant!

     eddie jumps in the car.  clarkson turns on the red bubble 
     light and the siren, and the car zooms off.
