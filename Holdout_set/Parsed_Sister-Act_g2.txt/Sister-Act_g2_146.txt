     int. lounge

     the lounge is deserted between shows, and all the lights 
     are out.  the mobsters enter with guns drawn.

                               joey
               i can't see anything in here!

                               vince
               willy -- hit the lights.

                               willy
               where?

                               vince
               find 'em!

     willy moves off to find the light switch.  there is a 
     flash of black and white fabric behind some chairs.

                               joey
               there!

               before he can shoot, there is another 
               flash of fabric on the opposite side of 
               the room.

                               vince
                             (aiming)
               no -- there!

     and a third flash of fabric near the stage.

                               joey
               over there!

     willy has found the lights, and the lounge is suddenly 
     brightly lit.  the mobsters blink for a moment, then find 
     all the nuns bunched together in a corner, trying to find 
     an exit.

                               vince
               freeze!  everybody!

     page 114.

     the nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding christy.

                               vince
               joey?

                               joey
               where is she?

     christy steps forward, to the front of the stage.

                               christy
               right here.  let the others go -- they 
               have nothing to do with this.

                               vince
               joey -- do it.

                               joey
               but, boss -- she's still, you know, a 
               nun.

                               vince
               she's a broad!  got it!  just some 
               broad!

     mother superior steps forward.

                               mother superior
                             (with authority)
               i guarantee you, she is no broad.  she 
               is sister mary clarence, of st. 
               katherine's convent.  she is a model of 
               generosity, virtue and love.  you have my 
               word, gentlemen.  she is a nun.

                               willy
               hear that?  now aren't you glad we 
               didn't shoot her?

     vince has had enough.  facing christy, he raises the gun 
     and points it right between christy's eyes, only inches 
     away.  the nuns all recoil with horror.

     blam!  the gun goes off, but christy isn't hit.  she 
     blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive.  instead, it's 
     vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his 
     shoulder.

     across the room, eddie holds a smoking police revolver. 
     the nuns all swarm around christy joyously.

                               mary robert
               mary clarence -- you're alive!

                               mary patrick
                             (smiling)
               christy.

                               mary lazarus
                             (also smiling)
               van cartier.

                               christy
               you know?  about me?  about everything?

     christy breaks away from the jubilant nuns. she faces 
     mother superior.

                               christy
               reverend mother -- thank-you.

                               mother superior
               oh?

                               christy
               you saved my life.

                               mother superior
               i'm a christian.

     police pour into the room and gather up joey, willy and 
     vince.  eddie walks over to christy and mother superior.

                               eddie
               don't you have a concert to go to?

                               christy
               that depends.  sisters, you don't know 
               this, but reverend mother's been making 
               all sorts of noises about resigning. 
               that's bad news.  i don't know if we 
               could sing, if we thought that was true.

                               mary robert
               not a note.

                               mary patrick
               impossible.

     mary lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she 
     has laryngitis.  all the other nuns imitate her.

                               christy
                             (to mother superior)
               then i guess you're stuck.  life 
               sentence.  no parole.

                               mother superior
               very well.
                             (she turns to eddie)
               i hold you responsible for all of this, 
               for introducing a lounge act into my 
               convent.  for utterly disrupting our way 
               of life.  and for placing all of us in 
               mortal danger.
                             (sincerely, with a 
                             smile)
               thank-you.

     page 116.

     angle on christy, watching this.  she grins.

                               christy
               yeah, eddie, thanks a whole bunch. 
               thanks for sticking me in a convent.  so 
               you think, after all this, maybe i really 
               am a nun?

                               eddie
               i don't know.  there's only one way to 
               be absolutely sure.

                               christy
               yeah, like what?

     eddie takes christy in his arms, and they begin a kiss.  
     as they do so, vince struggles toward christy, as two cops 
     hold him back.  he is furious.

                               vince
               i was good to you! you re nothing but 
               no-talent garbage! you're a two-bit 
               tramp!

                               christy
                             (staring at vince, 
                             seeing him for the scum 
                             that he is)
               that used to be true, vince.  i was with 
               you.  but something happened.  and i'm 
               different now.  real--different.  i've 
               had, well, you might call it -- a 
               religious experience.  and i've got just 
               two words for you.  and those two words 
               are...

                               mary robert
                             (afraid christy will 
                             curse)
               mary clarence!

                               christy
                             (grinning, to vince)
               bless you.
