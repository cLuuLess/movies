     int. mother superior's office

     christy is pacing, outraged at her new situation.

                               christy
               a convent?  they put me in a convent? 
               what's the problem?  wasn't there any 
               more room in hell?

                               mother superior
                             (very calm)
               what is your full name?  your christian 
               name?

                               christy
               mother theresa.  gandhi.  don't you 
               understand?  this is all a mistake.  i'm 
               the good guy.  i'm the witness.  and i'm 
               being punished!

                               mother superior
               your name?

                               christy
               christy.  christy van cartier.

                               mother superior
               enough joking.

                               christy
               that's my real name!  currently i'm a  
               singer.  sort of.

                               mother superior
               very well.

                               christy
               oh my god.  this isn't happening, tell 
               me this isn't happening.  it's a 
               nightmare, i'm back at st. anne's!

                               mother superior
               st. anne's?

                               christy
               parochial school.  akron.  st. 
               android's.

                               mother superior
               you were unhappy?

                               christy
               i was expelled!  when i was fifteen?

                               mother superior
               the reason?

                               christy
               beats me!  what do you think?  smoking! 
               heavy petting, without a chaperone. heavy 
               petting, with the chaperone.  and wearing 
               a black bra, under my uniform.  the demon 
               bra.

                               mother superior
               i see.

                               christy
               you see?  you see?  i have to get out of 
               here   i have to make a phone call.  
               don't you get  it?  i'm in a convent!  
               you're a nun!

                               mother superior
                             (very stern)
               sit down.

                               christy
               what?

     mother superior rises.  she is an extremely imposing 
     woman. 

                               mother superior
               sit.

     christy sits in a wooden chair across from mother 
     superior.

                               mother superior
               miss van cartier. 

                               christy
               what?
                             (belligerent)

                               mother superior
               your cigarette -- out.

     christy inspects her cigarette.

                               mother superior
                             (ruefully)
               it has come to pass.

                               christy
               what?

                               mother superior
               i joined this convent some thirty years 
               ago.  at that time, the world knew some 
               measure of peace.  and hope.  our order 
               was a beacon of hospitality, to families, 
               to children, to a neighborhood filled 
               with promise.  and, as the years have 
               passed, i have watched that promise 
               destroyed.  drugs.  gangs.
                             (staring at christy's 
                             outfit) spandex.  and. 
                             so i have made this 
                             convent an oasis, a 
                             retreat from horror. 
                             and now that horror has 
                             invaded these sacred 
                             walls.

                               christy
               are you talking about me?

                               mother superior
               and all those like you.

                               christy
               you mean black people?

                               mother superior
               absolutely not.  i mean the wicked.  the 
               heedless.  and their las vegas 
               concubines.

                               christy
                             (very suspicious) 
                             what's a concubine?

                               mother superior
               check your driver's license.

     christy stands, facing off with mother superior.

                               christy
               fine.  got it.  look, the way i see it, 
               i'm stuck here, right?  i mean, i'm here 
               or i'm target practice.  so here's the 
               deal -- i don't bug you, you don't bug 
               me.  i'll catch up on some sleep, watch 
               some tube, lay back and lay low.  so just 
               get me a key and show me to my room, and 
               do not disturb.  capisce?

                               mother superior
                             (suspiciously 
                             gracious)
               of course.  but it's almost lunch.

                               christy
               cool.  is there a menu?  or buffet?

                               mother superior
               before we do, you might like to freshen 
               up.  and you'll certainly want to change

                               christy
                             (sniffing her clothes, 
                             the same outfit she's 
                             had on since the night 
                             at vince's office)
               deal.
