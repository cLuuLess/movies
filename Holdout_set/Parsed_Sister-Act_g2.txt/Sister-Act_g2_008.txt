     int. dressing room - later

     a small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a 
     sputtering fan for ventilation.  christy has her own 
     dressing table and mirror, and the ronelles share a table a 
     few feet away.  clothing and costumes hang on nails or are 
     draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.

                               christy
               screw this dump.  it's a roach motel 
               with sequins.  every guy i meet is either 
               married, a cop, or a lush from des 
               moines.

                               michelle
               but what about us?

                               tina
               you taught us the act.  the songs, all 
               the moves.

                               christy
               and where did it get me?  i'm stuck in 
               this rathole!  you're holding me back, 
               just like vince!  i should be headlining!

     a pock-faced weasel of a man named joey opens the door and 
     leans into the room.

                               christy
               what do you want?  this is a private 
               area!  get lost!

                               joey
               you ain't got nothin' i ain't seen.

                               christy
               then stop trying to memorize it.  hit 
               the road.

     joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the 
     chair near christy.

                               joey
               from vince.

     page 8.

                               christy
               his ashes?

                               joey
               with love.

     joey leaves.  michelle and tina hover around the box, very 
     excited.  they pick it up, trying to tempt christy.

                               michelle
               from vince! with love!

                               tina
               michelle and tina can't restrain 
               themselves: they open the box.  inside is 
               a rather gaudy fur coat.  michelle and 
               tina are impressed.

                               michelle
               it's a fur!

                               tina
               it's new!

                               christy
               it's a bribe.  five years of my 
               goddamned life!

                               michelle
               so you earned it!

                               tina
               vince owns the casino!  cash in

                               christy
               i should throw this in his facet

     there's a knock on the door, and tina opens it.  
     lieutenant eddie mulcahy enters.  christy is not pleased.

                               christy
               oh, jesus.  what is going on here?
                             (to heaven)
               why me?  whose dog did i kill?

                               michelle
               hi, lieutenant.

                               tina
               hello, eddie.

     eddie picks up the coat.

                               eddie
               from vince?  what a guy.  doo-lang, doo-
               lang.

                               christy
               at least he's not a cop.  at least he 
               can afford a decent gift.

                               eddie
               i used to buy.you,..stuff.  on your 
               birthday .  when we were seeing each 
               other.

                               christy
               yeah, like what?  quilted coat hangers, 
               that your mother picked out?  lottery 
               tickets?  a travel iron?

                               eddie
               so i don't shop.

                               christy
               'cause you're always out, arresting 
               people.  making trouble.  i don't know 
               why i went out with you in the first 
               place, it was embarrassing!  i couldn't 
               hold my head up, i used to tell people 
               you were a security guard!

                               eddie
               oh, yeah? well, how do you think i felt?  
               you were singing in bowling alleys back 
               then.  i told people you were a hooker!

                               michelle
               calm down, you two.  it's always like 
               this.

                               eddie
               yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' 
               better class of people.  vince laflocca.

                               christy
               he's a businessman.

                               eddie
               a what? when are you qonna wake up?

                               christy
               when are you gonna get off my case?  
               have you got a search warrant?  what do 
               you want -- cheap thrills?

                               eddie
               information, baby.  i thought maybe 
               somebody around here might have a 
               conscience.

                               christy
               think again!  and get out of here.

     page 10.

                               eddie
               i'm going.  my regards to vince,   and 
               the mrs.

     christy hurls a jar of cold cream at eddie's head.  he 
     ducks, and the jar hits the door.

                               eddie
               ladies.

     eddie leaves.  christy is standing, absolutely furious.

                               christy
               that's it!  i'm not taking it from him, 
               and i'm not taking it from vince!  from 
               now on, it's all about me!  and if i 
               can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with 
               it -- it's gone.  like sister immaculata 
               used to say, "life is short, and then you 
               fry."  so long, girls -- see you in 
               church!

     christy grabs the mink and heads out the door.
