     ext. highway - day

     eddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the 
     siren screaming.  it blazes through traffic, weaving in and 
     out at breakneck speeds.  a moment later, joey and willy 
     pull onto the highway at a fast rate.  the race is on, with 
     eddie securely in the lead.
