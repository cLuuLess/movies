     ext. convent - day

     joey and willy park their car in front of the convent, get 
     out quickly and climb the steps to the front door.  they 
     ring the bell.

                               joey
               so that guy in the bar was right?  she's 
               like... some kind of nun?

                               willy
               yeah, right -- when i see it.

     lawanda and her friends watch joey and willy pounding on 
     the convent door.

                               lawanda
               you dudes looking for nuns?  they all 
               went to st. matthew's.

                               joey
               st, matthew's?  thanks.

                               lawanda
               praise the lord.

     joey and willy run past the girls, get into their car and 
     take off.
