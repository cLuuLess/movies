     ext. gas station

     christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station 
     office.  a bored mechanic is watching a small portable tv. 
     on the tv is an episode of "the flying nun":  sally field, 
     in full habit, is soaring along.

     suddenly, christy hears the loud roar of a motorcycle 
     starting up over by one of the gas pumps.  the biker turns 
     and looks at christy:  he has long hair, and a beard and 
     moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like jesus.

                               christy
               oh my god...

     christy runs up to the biker..

                               christy
               i'm late for church.  can i get a lift?

     christy swings onto the back seat; the biker puts his 
     harley in gear and flies down the street.  eddie is shocked 
     as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car 
     to follow.
