     int. stained class window - day

     jesus delivers the sermon on the mount in vibrant red, 
     blue and green stained glass.  an organ plays a hymn -- 
     badly.  notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated.

     pan down to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel 
     at the ancient st. katherine's convent.  the organ isn't 
     getting any better, and we see it is being played by sister 
     alma, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing 
     aid.  apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because 
     sister alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's 
     playing.

     as the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she 
     closes the door behind her.  across the lobby, the front 
     door opens and eddie enters with a very reluctant christy.

                               christy
                             (to eddie)
               i hate you.  i totally hate you.

                               eddie
               safest place in the world.  you think 
               vince would look for you here?

     as christy looks around the lobby, various religious 
     artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified p0v. 
     angle on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of 
     hymnals, and a large, framed sunday school-style portrait 
     of st. katherine.  christy shudders.

                               christy
               nuns, eddie.  there are nuns here. 
               everywhere.  it's crawling with 'em.

                               eddie
               it's a convent.  all you have to do is 
               shut up, behave yourself, and get along.

                               christy
               with nuns?  with rulers?  no way.  i'm 
               gonna go back, work things out with 
               vince.

     christy turns to head back to the entrance, but eddie 
     catches her arm.

                               eddie
               vince has put out a contract on you.  a 
               hundred grand.  you've seen him in 
               action.

     christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's 
     telling the truth.

                               christy
               but... but vince loves me.  how could 
               he... i mean, five years...

     page 20.

                               eddie
               and one bullet.  that's all it's gonna 
               take.

                               christy
                             (suddenly scared)
               but vince has contacts all over the 
               place!  this is san francisco!  they'll 
               be looking for me!

                               eddie
               everywhere but this little hole-in-the-
               wall convent.  nobody knows you're here 
               but me.  we're trying to get a quick 
               court date.  a month, maybe two, tops. 
               i'll spring you as soon as i can.

                               christy
                             (panicking)
               i can't stay here!  i'll crack up! 
               eddie, what am i gonna do?

                               eddie
               pray.
                             (smiling)

     from inside the chapel, the choir begins to sing a hymn --
     horribly.  the voices don't blend, and individual notes are 
     real migraine material.  christy looks aghast.  eddie urges 
     her into a corridor, and she follows.
