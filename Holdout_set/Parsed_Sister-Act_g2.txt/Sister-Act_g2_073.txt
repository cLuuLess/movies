     int. chapel

     at the end of the first verse, christy signals the choir 
     to stop.  there's a hush in the chapel as christy glances 
     at the vacant pews.  then she turns to sister alma and 
     nods. sister alma strikes a bold, stirring chord.

     several of the nuns blink.  bishop o'hara glances at the 
     organ with surprise.  mother superior sits up with a 
     stiffened back and a severe expression.

     as the chord grows in force, christy gives the choir a 
     beat.

                               christy
               one, two, three...

     the choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn. 
     christy strides up and down in front of the choir, 
     transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem, with a 
     passionate call-and-response format.

                               choir
               let thy thoughts be guided

                               christy
               what you say?

                               choir
               let thy soul be healed

                               christy
               but how?

                               choir
               by a voice you hear from on high

                               christy
               i think i hear it!

                               choir
               let thy thoughts be guided

                               christy
               you know, i just might!

                               choir
               let thy soul be healed

                               christy and choir 
               let thy spirit take wing and fly!

     spontaneous reactions from everyone in the church.
