     int. st. matthew's cathedral

     the choir has gathered together in a small room off the 
     main chapel.  they are putting finishing touches on their 
     choral robes, and are waiting nervously to go on.

                               mary patrick
                             (to christy)
               i just realized -- this is the last time 
               we'll all be together.  we're going to 
               miss you so much.

     christy and mary patrick embrace.  mary patrick is 
     tearful.

                               christy
               hey -- you re supposed to be the 
               cheerful one.  why do i suddenly feel 
               like snow white?

                               mary lazarus
                             (to christy, with 
                             humor)
               you re okay -- for a civilian.

     christy and mary lazarus embrace.

                               mary robert
               reverend mother?

                               mother superior
               yes?

                               mary robert
               since mary clarence came to st. 
               katherine's, i've been shot at, kidnapped 
               by mafia hit men, and i've tasted beer.  
               is that enough experience yet?  for final 
               vows?

                               christy
               i don't think so.  what about skydiving?  
               a crank call to billy graham?

                               mother superior
               you have evidenced great maturity, mary 
               robert.  we shall have a serious 
               discussion.

                               christy
               what about me, reverend mother?  i think 
               you were right.  i'm just a bad 
               influence.  sister show biz.

                               mother superior
               perhaps not.  perhaps we can all use... 
               a little spandex.

                               christy
               really?  and maybe shorter habits, and 
               women priests, and sleeping late?

                               mother superior
               don't push it.

     christy and mother superior embrace.
