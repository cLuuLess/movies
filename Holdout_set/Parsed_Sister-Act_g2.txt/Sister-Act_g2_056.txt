     int. christy's cell - midnight

     christy is lying flat out on her bed, in her habit, 
     utterly exhausted by the week's hard labor.  there is a 
     meek scratching at her door.

                               christy
                             (without moving)
               yeah?

     sister mary robert enters, very shyly.  she barely looks 
     up.

                               christy
               what?  what does she want now?  i did 
               the dishes.  i oiled the pews.  i dusted 
               the hymnals.  two hundred hymnals.  why 
               can't people share?

                               mary robert
                             (not speaking above a 
                             whisper)
               i... i...

     page 48.

                               christy
               what?

                               mary robert
               i... i brought you something.

                               christy
               a cigarette?

                               mary robert
               an extra heel of bread.  please take it, 
               you need your strength.  you've been 
               working so hard.

     mary robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown 
     bread.  christy takes it..

                               christy
               thanks.  so which one are you? sister 
               bruce?  sister doug?

                               mary robert
                             (until almost 
                             whispering)
               mary robert.  i'm... mary robert.

                               christy
               right.  okay.  bob.  nice to know you.

     mary robert nods, and resumes looking at her hands.  she 
     doesn't 1eave, but she's still tongue-tied. christy is at a 
     loss.

                               christy
               so, bob, how long have you been in? st. 
               k's?

                               mary robert
               three years.  sister.

                               christy
               three years.  a rookie.

                               mary robert
               a novice.

                               christy
               yeah, like a learner's permit, right? 
               when do you hit the big time?  you know, 
               when do you take the final vows?

     mary robert bursts into tears.

                               christy
               whoa!  bob!  what's going on here? 
               what'd i say?

     page 49.

                               mary robert
                             (still sobbing)
               you have to help me

                               christy
               right, sure, but what's the problem? are 
               they keeping you a prisoner here? do they 
               drug you?  did reverend mother like, 
               kidnap your parents?  we can call the 
               enquirer.

                               mary robert
               no, you don't understand -- i don't want 
               to get out!  i want to get in?

                               christy
               excuse me?

                               mary robert
               oh. mary clarence, i'm so unworthy.  i 
               want to take my final vows, i would do it 
               tomorrow, but reverend mother won't let 
               me!

                               christy
               she won't?  why not?

                               mary robert
               she says i should wait.  she says that 
               no one should become a nun as an escape 
               from life.  she says that i'm not 
               experienced enough to make the decision 
               yet.  in a mature manner.

                               christy
               she said that?  reverend mother?

     mary robert nods, solemnly.  suddenly, from the streets 
     outside the convent, we hear a blast of hot dance music, 
     and the sound of laughter and carefree conversation.

                               christy
               well, then there's only one thing to do.

                               mary robert
               what?

                               christy
               reverend mother says you need 
               experience, right, in life.  in order to 
               make a responsible decision.  this is 
               going to be very painful for me.  you 
               know how much i love this little room. 
               this whole convent.  wait.

     christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the 
     wall.  she speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if jesus 
     is advising her.

     page 50.

                               christy
                             (to jesus)
               must i do this thing, 0 lord?  please 
               help me.,. yes, i know... i must put my 
               selfish cares aside... i must think of 
               others... yes, she's here...
                             (she gestures to mary 
                             robert)
               he says hi... yes, i understand... let 
               thy will be done.  amen.  you too.

     christy turns to mary robert, having received a holy 
     message.

                               christy
               we must do this sacred thing, mary 
               robert.

                               mary robert
                             (desperate)
               of course!  we must do it!  it's the 
               will of god!  what is it?

                               christy
                             (shutting her eyes, 
                             for the full spiritual 
                             effect)
               we must... get you some experience.  we 
               must... leave this place.

                               mary robert
               are you sure?

     another blast of music from the street.  christy turns to 
     the crucifix.  she gets confirmation.

                               christy
                             (to jesus)
               we hear you.
