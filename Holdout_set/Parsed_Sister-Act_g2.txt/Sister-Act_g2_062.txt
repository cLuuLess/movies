     ext. alley

     running up the alley, christy and mary robert hear mike's 
     footsteps chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them.

                               mary robert
               mary clarence! 

                               christy
               keep moving!

     christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves mary 
     robert up the ladder ahead of her.

                               christy
               climb!  now!

     as christy and mary robert climb the fire escape, another 
     gunshot echoes in the alley, ricocheting off the fire 
     escape.

     the nuns climb higher up the building.  mike pursues, 
     looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but 
     not finding any openings.  he takes the steps two at a time 
     and begins to gain ground.

     at the fourth floor landing, christy's heel gets stuck in 
     the grating.  she pulls frantically at the laces.

                               christy
               goddamn it!

                               mary robert
               mary clarence!

     mike arrives at the landing just as christy twists her 
     toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for 
     the gun.  mike's hand is knocked back against the metal 
     frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, rattling 
     down the metal steps to the landing below.  christy shoves 
     mary robert into the open window of an apartment, and 
     follows her in.
