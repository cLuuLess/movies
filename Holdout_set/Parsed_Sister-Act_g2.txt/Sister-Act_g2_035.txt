     int. convent dining hall

     a large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a 
     crude iron chandelier.  there is a long, central wooden 
     table, with rough wooden benches.

     the convent's population is standing around the table in 
     silence.  there are about thirty nuns in all.

     mother superior moves to the head of the table, with 
     christy following her.  she motions for christy to stand at 
     her right.

                               mother superior
               good afternoon, sisters.  i apologize 
               for my tardiness.  i would like you to 
               welcome a new member of our order, sister 
               mary clarence.

     angle on sister mary robert, the nun standing beside 
     christy.  sister mary robert is naive and mouse- like, but 
     very sweet.  she has only been at the convent a few years; 
     she wears the simpler habit of a novice.  she sneaks a look 
     at christy.  her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring 
     at her hands.

                               mother superior
               mary clarence comes to us from a 
               somewhat more progressive convent.  she 
               is eager for a more disciplined life, and 
               will make every effort to conform to our 
               ways.

     everyone sits, including christy.  sister mary patrick, a 
     nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. mary 
     patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person.

                               mother superior
               yes, mary patrick?

                               mary patrick
               reverend mother, on behalf of the 
               sisters, i'd like to welcome mary 
               clarence to st. katherine's.

     angle on christy, looking thoroughly disgusted. 

     page 28.

                               mary patrick
               as part of our welcome, i've had a 
               little thought, just for fun.  could we 
               have our new friend offer today's 
               blessing?

     angle on the nuns, watching christy.

                               mother superior
                             (reluctantly)
               very well.  mary clarence, rise please.

     christy stands up slowly, aghast.

                               christy
               a blessing?  like, for lunch?

     angle on mary patrick, beaming.  she and the other nuns 
     bow their heads.

                               christy
                             (trying to recall a 
                             blessing)
               for what we are about to receive...

     so far, so good.  mother superior has one eye open.

                               christy
               may the lord... prepare us and... watch 
               us and... walk through the valley and be 
               our shepherd and... to the republic for 
               which it stands... god bless us every 
               one, hallowed be thy name.  hallelujah.  
               ave maria. boyardee.  amen.

     angle on the nuns, staring at christy. mother superior 
     rises, very quickly.

                               mother superior
               sisters, for the rest of the day we 
               shall declare a vow of silence.

                               christy
               a what?

                               mother superior
               surely you are familiar with this 
               practice, mary clarence.  only when our 
               lips are silent, can our prayers truly be 
               heard.

                               christy
               silence?  no talking?  all day?

                               mother superior
               until sundown.

     page 29.

                               christy
                             (mouthing the words. 
                             without speaking aloud)
               oh my god.

     christy reaches for a piece of bread.

                               mother superior
               and mary clarence?

     christy looks up.

                               mother superior
               as a new member of our order, i think 
               you might also enjoy a ritual fast.

                               christy
                             (mouthing the words)
               a what?

                               mother superior
               a fast.  to remind us of the poor, of 
               those who must endure without enough to 
               eat.

                               christy
                             (mouthing)
               no food?

                               mother superior
                             (taking away christy's 
                             plate)
               no food.  not until sundown.

     angle on christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching 
     the other nuns eat.
