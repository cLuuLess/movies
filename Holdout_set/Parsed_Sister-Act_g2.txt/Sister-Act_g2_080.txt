     christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of 
     the street.  they get lots of attention each step of the 
     way.  as each nun raps, the other nuns make rhythmic boom-
     box noises.

                               christy
                             (rapping)
               we're the sisters of the sacred heart we 
               do our bit, now do your part

                               mary robert
                             (rapping)
               honor thy mother and thy father too
               don't kill, don't steal, it's bad for 
               you

                               mary patrick
                             (rapping)
               believe in the lord, his will be done
               come to church, it's tons of fun

                             (rapping)
               dig down deep, give all you can
               trust me, children, there's a heavenly 
               plan!

     the parade goes on, the crowd gathers, and a general air 
     of jubilance prevails.
