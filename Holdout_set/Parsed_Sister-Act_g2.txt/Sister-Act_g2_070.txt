     int. convent laundry room - day

     this is a basement utility room.     a large industrial 
     washer-dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a 
     repetitive chung-chung sound

     page 66.

     the choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others 
     fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long 
     table.  christy is helping mary patrick fold a sheet.  
     everyone is working rhythmically, to the drone of the 
     washer-dryer.

                               christy
               that machine.

                               mary patrick
               i know.  it's ancient.

                               christy
               it's a rhythm section.  the beat.

     christy starts clapping her hands to the sound of the 
     washer-dryer; gradually, the other nuns join her.

                               christy
               mary patrick -- do you remember the 
               dixie cups?

                               mary patrick
               the dixie cups?  oh my.  i was just a 
               girl.  of course.
                             (singing)
               spring is here
               the sun will shine

                               christy
                             (stopping the beat)
               hold it.  mary patrick, you're a pretty 
               cheerful person, aren't you?

                               mary patrick
               am i?

     there is a murmur from all the other nuns -- "oh, yes.

                               mary patrick
                             (as a confession)
               all right, i am, i know it!  all my 
               life, i've just been... upbeat. 
               optimistic.  perky.  i can't help it. 
               even when i was little, i remember my 
               mother used to say, "that child is pure 
               sunshine.  she'll either be a nun -- or a 
               stewardess."

                               christy
               so use it.  when we sing hymns, they're 
               usually about rejoicing, right? 
               celebration.  most music is.  so don't 
               hold back.  let all that joy go right 
               into your voice.  make me happy.  let me 
               hear it.  perk out.  perk down.

                               mary patrick
                             (with real joy)
               spring is here
               the sun will shine
               i'll be his
               and he'll be mine
               we'll love until
               the end of time
               and we'll never be lonely anymore

                               christy
               because we're

                               all the nuns
               going to the chapel
               and we're gonna get married
               going to the chapel
               and we're gonna get married
               going to the chapel
               and we're gonna get married

                               mary patrick
               going to the chapel of love!

     the nuns have really gotten into the song, with christy 
     encouraging them verbally.  they are sounding better and 
     better.

     sister mary frederick, a member of the choir, steps into 
     the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden, piercing 
     whistle.  the nuns immediately stop singing, and a moment 
     later mother superior enters.

     the room is quiet except for the sound of the washer-
     dryer. the nuns all get very busy at their laundry tasks.

                               nuns
                             (in unison)
               good morning, reverend mother.

                               mother superior
               good morning, sisters.

     mother superior takes one more glance around, then leaves.

     now that the coast is clear, the singing begins again, 
     quietly, to the rhythm of the machine.

                               nuns
               going to the chapel...
