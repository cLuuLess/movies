     int. vince's office - night

     ernie schmidt sits across the enormous mahogany desk from 
     vince.  the young man's throat is dry; he's sweating 
     bullets.  the presence of joey the weasel and willy, a 
     brutal thug, increases ernie's tension.

                               vince
               ernie schmidt.  how long you been with 
               us, ernie schmidt?

                               ernie
               three years, mr. larocca.  one behind 
               the bar, two as croupier.

     vince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings.

                               vince
               ernie, you know what's important to me?  
               what counts?  it's not all this.  this is 
               '-- what?  frosting.  loyalty.  that's me, 
               ernie.  that's home.

     vince gestures to joey, who takes out a revolver and 
     points it at ernie's head.

                               vince
               you ain't been loyal, ernie.  what did 
               you tell the cops?

     ernie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer 
     to his temple.
