     int. convent kitchen - night

     the kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle 
     carried by christy.  three more candles appear, carried by 
     mary robert, mary patrick and mary lazarus.  the door to 
     the freezer opens, and light spills out.  christy removes 
     several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the 
     nuns.

                               mary robert
                             (delighted)
               ice cream!

                               mary patrick
               mary clarence -- you shouldn't have. 
               where did you get this?

                               mary lazarus
               it's a sin.  it's a wicked indulgence. 
               is this butter almond?

     christy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice 
     cream by candlelight.

                               christy
               it's contraband.  don't ask.  but i 
               wanted to give you a treat.  a sort of... 
               thank-you gift.

                               mary robert
               a thank-you?  for what?  you're the one 
               we should be thanking.

                               mary lazarus
               is there any syrup?

                               christy
               well... see, at my old convent, i wasn't 
               always... real popular.  i was sort of 
               selfish and... not real helpful.  okay, 
               i'll say it -- i wasn't much of a nun. 
               but now, thanks to all of you... maybe 
               i'm shaping up.

                               mary robert
               mary clarence, don't be silly.  you're 
               an example to us all.  you've taught us 
               so much.  we're singing for the 
               cardinals, and then -- who knows?  maybe 
               the choir can travel -- to schools, and 
               nursing homes.

                               mary patrick
               maybe we can get some of the local kids 
               to sing with us.

                               mary lazarus
               we could cut a demo.  look for a label.

                               christy
                             (knowing she has to 
                             leave)
               that's true, wouldn't that be great.  of 
               course, we never know when things are 
               going to change.  any one of us could be 
               transferred to another convent, tomorrow.

                               mary robert
                             (worried)
               are you leaving us?

                               christy
                             (sincerely)
               oh no.  we'll always be together.

                               mary lazarus
               that's what diana ross said.

     christy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice 
     cream, in a spirit of true friendship.

     mother superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows 
     by the door to the kitchen.  she has begun to see christy 
     in a new light.  she looks thoughtful, and walks off.
