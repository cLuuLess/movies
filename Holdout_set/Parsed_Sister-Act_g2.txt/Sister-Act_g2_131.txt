     once again, joey and willy find vince.

                               vince
               well?

                               joey
               it didn't work, vince.

                               vince
               you were both supposed to put your guns 
               to her head and shoot.

                               willy
               we both missed.

                               vince
               okay, so the problem is still the nun 
               outfit, right?

                               joey
               right.

                               vince
               so, take it off.

                               willy
                             (shocked)
               strip down a nun?  you want us to fry?

                               joey
               for like, twelve zillion eternities?

                               vince
               i'm telling you, she's not a nun!  get 
               her out of the nun outfit, and put her in 
               some clothes.

                               joey
               maybe pants.

                               willy
               a sweater.

                               joey
               and then we can ice her.  no nun, no 
               evil eye.

     joey and willy are very confident about this solution. 
     they strut off, pleased with themselves.
