     int. choir rehearsal room - that day

     there are twelve nuns in the room, going over sheet music. 
     mary lazarus is the group's leader; mary patrick and mary 
     robert are also in the choir.  christy appears at the door, 
     grimacing.

                               christy
               is this... choir practice?

                               mary patrick
               sure is!  come on in, and sing a spell.

     christy spots mary robert.

                               christy
               mary robert, i am so sorry about last 
               night...

                               mary robert
               now stop that.  you didn't shoot at me.  
               you were only trying to help, to give me 
               experience.  i tried to explain that to 
               reverend mother, but -- i don't know if 
               she understood.

     mary lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at 
     christy.

                               mary lazarus
               soprano or alto?

                               christy
                             (very gloomy)
               whatever.

     page 60.

     mary lazarus hands christy a hymnal, and raps her baton. 
     the choir begins to sing; christy doesn't even bother 
     trying.  she is horrified; the choir is the worst-sounding 
     group in history.  they seem to be singing in several 
     random keys, and they even have trouble with the words.  no 
     one looks up from their hymnals.  sister alma, the organist 
     with the hearing aid, is plodding along.
