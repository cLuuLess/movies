     int. blue collar bar - day

     mike the bartender is taking chairs off tables and setting 
     them on the floor as joey and willy enter.

                               joey
               we're looking for mike.

                               mike
               you found him -- but we're not open yet.

     willy grabs mike's arms and bends them behind his back.

                               mike
               hey -- the till's empty!

     willy slams mike's face into the wall, stunning him.  joey 
     lifts mike's groggy face and offers sympathy.

                               joey
               i'm sorry -- i don't know what gets into 
               him.

                               mike
               who are you guys?

                               joey
               we're the guys from vegas.  you had 
               christy last night, but you let her get 
               away.  it's upsetting.

     willy hammers mike's face into the wall again.

                               mike
               but you didn't tell me!

                               joey
               we didn't tell you what?

                               mike
               that she's a nun!  that chick you're 
               looking for -- she's a nun!

                               willy
               what?  christy?

     page 61.

                               joey
               a nun?

                               mike
               i'm telling you!

     willy and joey look at each other, and consider this.  
     then they burst out laughing.  they refuse to believe 
     mike's story.

                               willy
               gimme a hand here.

     willy and joey pick mike up, and hurl him over the bar. 
     then they exit, still laughing.

                               joey
               a nun!
