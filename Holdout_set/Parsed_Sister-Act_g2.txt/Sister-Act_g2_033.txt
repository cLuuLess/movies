     int. convent changing room

     christy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring 
     at herself, in complete shock.  she now wears a habit and 
     wimple.  mother superior is doing final adjustments on the 
     wimple.

                               christy
                             (almost unable to 
                             speak)
               no!  no!  i can't do this!

                               mother superior
               normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, 
               and you endanger us all.  while you are 
               here, you will conduct yourself as a nun.  
               only i shall know who, and what, you 
               truly are.  you will not disrupt the 
               convent.  you will not influence the 
               sisters with your colorful street talk. 
               you will draw no attention to yourself in 
               any way.

                               christy
                             (furious, in 
                             disbelief)
               but look at rites  look at this!  i'm a 
               nun!  i'm invisible!  i'm a penguin!

                               mother superior
               as of now, and until you leave, you are 
               sister mary clarence.

                               christy
                             (outraged)
               mary clarence?  like a guy?  like a dumb 
               guy?
