     ext. police station - day

     vince leaves the police station with his henchmen, joey 
     and willy, and larry narren, an attorney.  vince is 
     steaming as they walk through the parking lot.

                               vince
               they grilled me for six hours in there. 
               and my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell 
               were you?

                               larry
               it takes time, vince.  slow and steady. 
               we've been through this before.

     vince reaches his car.  as joey opens the door for him, 
     another car drives by, and stops.  eddie is driving; he 
     leans out the window.

                               eddie
               so long, vince.  see you soon.

     page 30.

     vince lurches toward eddie; larry restrains him.  eddie 
     drives off, chuckling.

                               vince
               he's so damn cocky.  this is different.

                               joey
               it's a bluff, vince.

                               vince
               you know so much.  they've got christy, 
               and we've got to find her.  get her 8x10, 
               from in front of the lounge.  fax it to 
               every contact we got.

     larry covers his ears with both hands.

                               larry
               i can't hear this.  i'm an attorney, 
               vince, and you're just an honest casino 
               owner.  object of a witch hunt. innocent 
               victim.

                               vince
               keep the message vague, but let 'em 
               know.  the price has gone up.  christy 
               van cartier -- a quarter of a million.  
               dead or nearby.

     vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car.
