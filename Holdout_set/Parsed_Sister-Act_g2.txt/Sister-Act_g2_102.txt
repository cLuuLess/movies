     ext. convent - day

     the neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off.  
     banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across 
     the street:  "st. kate's - the greatest!", "good luck 
     tonight!"

     a catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in 
     front.  several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry 
     onto the bus.  a moment later, eddie's police car streaks 
     up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the 
     corner from the bus.
