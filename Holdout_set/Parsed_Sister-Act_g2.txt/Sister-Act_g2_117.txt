     int. cathedral

     christy and mary robert rush down a side corridor, turn a 
     corner and see two tv technicians standing near some cables 
     with the letters of the network embroidered on the backs of 
     their jackets.  christy rushes up to them and taps them on 
     the shoulders.

                               christy
               excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room?

     the two technicians turn toward her, and she is horrified 
     to see they are. joey and willy.  christy gasps as willy 
     sticks a gun in her ribs.  joey smiles at her.

                               joey
               the rehearsal room is right this way.

     joey opens a door that leads to an alley behind the 
     cathedral.  mary robert looks confused.

                               mary robert
               wait, this isn't the way.  who are you?

                               christy
               they're from my old convent.

     christy suddenly lifts her knee into willy's groin, and he 
     buckles over.  she scrambles for the gun, but joey beats 
     her to it.  christy looks frantically at mary robert.

                               christy
               run!  take off! 

                               mary robert
               again?

     revived willy lunges for mary robert and grabs her.  the 
     two men hustle the two struggling nuns out the door to the 
     alley.
