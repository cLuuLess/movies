     the nuns leave the terminal and stand on the sidewalk out 
     front.

                               mary robert
               las vegas -- she's here somewhere.

                               mother superior
               but where?

                               mary patrick
               look!  there she is!

     mary patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that 
     feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos.  the 
     center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel, 
     the elvis impersonator, and christy and the ronelles.  the 
     bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the 
     moonlight casino and lounge.

                               mary robert
               the little sisters of the moonlight!

               stand back.
                             (she strides into the 
                             road)
               taxi!
