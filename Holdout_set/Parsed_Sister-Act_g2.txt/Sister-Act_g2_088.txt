     int. chapel

     sister alma plays the organ, and the choir hums quietly as 
     christy addresses the congregation.  cameras from several 
     tv stations are focussed on her from various places in the 
     chapel.

                               christy
               this sunday's hymn is inspired by the 
               lesson of mary magdalene.  you know the 
               one.  mary magdalene was a young lady 
               with a past.  she was no stranger to sin.  
               she was no stranger to practically 
               everybody.  many condemned her.  the 
               whole neighborhood.  but one man refused 
               to do so.  one man said, hey now, wait a 
               minute.  listen to the story.

     sister alma starts playing a doo-wop vamp.  mary patrick 
     and mary robert step forward from the choir, standing 
     beside christy the way the ronelles used to do.

                               christy
               hey, girls. 

                               mary patrick and robert
               hail, mary.

                               christy
               jerusalem is a real drag.  everybody 
               hates me.

                               mary patrick and robert
               oh-huh.

                               christy
               people throw stones.  they call me 
               names.  i mean, really.

                               mary patrick and robert
               really.

                               christy
               but -- wait.

                               mary patrick
               what is it, mary?

                               christy
               that man -- who is he?

                               mary robert
               he's a carpenter.

                               mary patrick
               he's not like other guys.

                               mary robert
               he's decent.

                               mary patrick
               he's kind.

                               christy
               he's... dreamy.  he's...

                               choir
               yes, mary?

                               christy
               he's so fine...

     the full choir sings back-up while christy, mary patrick 
     and mary robert perform intricate girl group choreography.

                               choir
               doo- lang, doo-lang, doo- lang.

                               christy/mary robert/ mary patrick
               wish he was mine
               that handsome guy over there
               the one with the wavy hair

     sister alma is surrounded by several street kids who play 
     guitar, bass and drums to accompany the organ and choir.

     lawanda and her friends sit in a pew, moving joyously to 
     the music.

     eddie stands in the back of the chapel, watching a christy 
     he has never seen before.  christy is now glowing with 
     happiness and confidence.

     as the song continues, we see the chapel is packed to the 
     rafters.  a tin bucket is passed around as a collection 
     plate, and it overflows with money.
