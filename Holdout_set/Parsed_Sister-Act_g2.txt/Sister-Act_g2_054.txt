     int. corridor

     mother superior is striding down the hall; she is livid. 
     christy trails behind her, trying to keep up.

                               christy
               i'm sorry, i'm not a weaver!

                               mother superior
               months of work, and the loom, absolutely 
               ruined!

                               christy
               look, this isn't my kind of thing!  i 
               wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, 
               or knit little sweaters! i don't do that!  
               i'm a star!

     mother superior stops dead in her tracks; she turns and 
     stares at christy.  then she smiles, in a rather 
     frightening manner.

     montage - christy

     a)on her hands and knees. scrubbing the stone floor of a 
     convent hallway.

     b)crawling along between the pews in the chapel, oiling 
     every inch of wood with a bottle of polish and a rag.

     c)crawling along the convent roof, cleaning out gutters 
     with a trowel.  she discovers a dead rat in one of the 
     gutters.

     d)sewing; she is repairing a hole in a habit.  the camera 
     pulls back.  christy is sitting in a small stone room, 
     surrounded by piles of torn habits, linen and other 
     mending.
