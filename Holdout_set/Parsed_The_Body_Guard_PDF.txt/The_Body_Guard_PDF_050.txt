52 int. rachel's bedroom - night 52 
the room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty 
apart from rachel's collection of old and faded dolls 
on the shelves and on the bed.  rachel is getting dressed 
for the evening.  a hairdresser stands behind her, 
fussing with her hair.  rachel hears the music coming 
from outside and moves to the window.  (the hairdresser 
moves with her, still busy with the brush.)  gazing 
across the garden, she sees the light in frank's room 
and hears her own voice singing out from there too.
