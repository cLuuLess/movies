59 int. dressing room - night 59 
rachel sits in front of the mirror putting on the silver 
headpiece we saw earlier.  she notices a small spray of 
lilies-of-the-valley among the floral arrangements. 
an envelope marked "rachel" is attached to it.  she 
reaches forward and opens it. 
we see the note as she unfolds it. 
marron bitch - you have everything 
i have nothing - prepare your soul 
for death - the time to die is... 
we see the shock in her face.
