63 int. stage - night 63 
devaney 
i'm afraid that... 
a great gush of applause from the audience.  devaney's 
befuddled.  he doesn't see rachel walking up behind him. 
devaney 
rachel won't be able... 
rachel stands beside him beaming.  she bows.  claps back 
to her fans.  devaney retreats.  rachel gestures in his 
direction. 
rachel 
bill devaney, ladies and gentlemen, 
thank you, bill.  hey, everyone. 
hello!  isn't billy thomas the 
greatest.  he's asked me to sing 
a song.  i hope you don't mind. 
the crowd roars its approval. 
frank nervously scans the room.  rachel smiles and moves 
along the stage.  music starts in the b.g.  masking 
obvious fear, she starts to sing. 
as she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers 
tremble.  she clasps it again to hide her anxiety.

angle - rachel - shot from behind 
shows her alone and vulnerable, bathed in light, center- 
stage. 
rachel snatches a quick glance at frank then looks back 
to her silent audience. 
angle - frank 
he scans the audience intensely, face to face. 
63a ext. mayan - backstage door - night 63a 
rachel's limo stands waiting.  camera pulls back to 
reveal a black toyota 4 x 4 parked among the other cars. 
63b int. mayan - night 63b 
rachel approaches the end of her song, her voice coming 
ever stronger.  spector comes up to frank in the wings, 
positioning himself combatively between frank and his 
view of rachel. 
spector 
are we having a communications problem 
here? 
frank 
what? 
spector's presence is a distraction.  frank steps to one 
side for a better view of rachel.  spector moves too. 
spector 
apparently, i didn't make it clear 
to you how things go around here. 
frank 
you told me you were going to 
tell her.  and you didn't. 
spector 
i didn't think she could handle it. 
frank 
but she handled it fine. 
frank continues to peer past spector's shoulder, his 
vigilance undiminished.  soothed and nurtured by the 
obvious admiration of her audience, rachel's fear is 
beginning to vanish.  the song is taking over.  spector 
changes tack, becoming confidential, "man-to-man."
53. 
spector 
look.  frank, i know what you're 
saying.  i know you want to do 
what's best for her.  i understand 
that.  you have a job to do here. 
but you have to understand that 
rachel has a job to do too.  and 
that's what she's doing - out 
there.  she's working, frank. 
that's what she does and that's 
where she does it.  she's hot 
right now.  this is the time for 
her.  if she doesn't get out there, 
she's dead.  forget about crazy 
death threats, if she doesn't 
sing, she's dead anyway... look, 
handled properly, this thing could 
be good for a million dollars' 
worth of free publicity.  
frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a 
wall of curtain ropes. 
frank 
one word. 
spector 
it could clinch her the nomination. 
frank 
one word in print about any of 
this... 
spector nods, half-gasping.  frank tightens his grip. 
frank's attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the 
crowd. 
spector 
trouble with you is you don't 
understand the sympathy vote.
