56 ext. backstage entrance - night 56 
as rachel's car pulls up, the beaten man dances weirdly 
at the curb with blood streaming from his nose. 
a pair of security guards try to hold them back.  as her 
limo stops, a chant begins. 
crowd 
rachel!  rachel!  we want rachel! 
others join in as the mob presses forward. 
the instant she exits the car, her expression goes public 
-- a wide, show-biz smile.  sandwiched between spector and 
devaney, with tony in front and frank at the rear, rachel 
makes her entrance. 
a young man breaks the barrier moving toward rachel. 
frank grabs him by one of his belt loops, gracefully 
guides him all the way across and slips him under the 
opposite cordon into the arms of a security guard.
