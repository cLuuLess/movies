35 int. rachel's bedroom - day 35 
rachel, looking out her window at fletcher and the work- 
men, sees the rock stop a yard from him.  fletcher 
scrambles away, much as a kid might dance back from a
30. 
wave on a beach.  the sight disturbs rachel. 
rachel 
fletcher!  c'mon.  back in here! 
as she speaks, some workmen test the remote control on a 
window shutter.  it descends in front of rachel's face. 
she is not amused.  fletcher passes frank on his way to 
join rachel.  he mutters almost under his breath. 
fletcher 
i think he's got a black 4 x 4.  could 
be a chevy.  more like a toyota. 
frank stares at fletcher, then looks back to the street.
