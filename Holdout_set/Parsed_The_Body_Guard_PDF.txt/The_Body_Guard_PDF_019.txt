21 ext. pool area - day 21 
fletcher, happy to have someone to talk to, walks up to 
frank with his remote-control speed boat.  frank would 
like to walk away, but fletcher blocks his way.  frank 
looks at fletcher's frail little, nut-brown figure.  the 
watching nanny continues her embroidering, some way off. 
fletcher 
hi! 
frank 
(continuing to walk) 
hi. 
fletcher 
how are you today? 
frank 
(wants to keep walking) 
all right.  how 'bout yourself? 
fletcher 
oh, i'm fine.  do you like boats?
19. 
frank gives up.  he's not going to get out of here.  he 
stops. 
frank 
no.  i don't like boats. 
fletcher 
you don't!  why not? 
frank 
oh, i don't know. 
fletcher 
sure you do, but you don't want 
to tell me. 
frank considers him, then slips out of his sport coat. 
he crouches down so that he is eye-level with fletcher. 
frank 
you're a smart kid. 
fletcher nods. 
frank 
i'll tell you.  one time i was 
stuck on a boat with some people 
for four months. 
fletcher 
a lifeboat? 
frank 
nope.  a big white yacht.  do you 
know what a yacht is? 
fletcher 
(thinks about this) 
yeah.  my mom rented this huge 
yacht once, and we took a trip. 
it was great.  everyone threw up 
except me.  i love 'em. 
frank 
(standing to leave) 
well, nobody's perfect. 
fletcher squints up at him, the sun in his eyes. 
fletcher 
you're the bodyguard, aren't you? 
frank is surprised. 
frank 
what do you know about it?
20. 
fletcher 
i've got ears. 
frank 
i'll remember that. 
devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath.  he is 
holding a bulging manila file.  as he sees fletcher, he 
holds the file casually at his side. 
frank sees fletcher looking at the file. 
devaney 
how are you, fletch? 
(to frank) 
i'm glad you waited.  let's go 
over here. 
frank 
(to fletcher) 
nice meeting you. 
fletcher looks after them silently.
