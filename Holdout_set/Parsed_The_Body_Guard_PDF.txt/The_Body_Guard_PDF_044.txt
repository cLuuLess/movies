46 int. rachel's bedroom - day 46 
a mild-looking old locksmith is working on rachel's 
window.  rachel walks in from the pool, starting to 
peel off the swimsuit.  she stops, startled, as she sees 
him.  this is the last straw.  she blows up. 
rachel 
(clutching the 
 swimsuit) 
you!  you!  out!  out!  now!  out 
of here!  get out! 
terrified, the old locksmith drops his tools and begins 
backing out of the room. 
old locksmith 
yes, ma'am.  thank you.  i'm a real 
fan of yours, miss marron. 
still angry, but disarmed, rachel makes a face. 
rachel 
then you can take your tools with you. 
she turns to the window, in what she imagines is 
frank's general direction, and, like a little girl, 
suddenly sticks out her tongue.
