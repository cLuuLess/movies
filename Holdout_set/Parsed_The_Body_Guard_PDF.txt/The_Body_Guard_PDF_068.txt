the crowd is thinning out.  a dim worklight is burning 
somewhere backstage.  the auditorium is a mess; the 
cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the 
riot.  footsteps approach, walking, pausing, as if looking

lying on the floor in big closeup we see a small fragment 
of rachel's dress.  the footsteps stop by it.  a hand 
picks it up gently and lifts it out of frame.  we hear the 
sound of a deep lingering inhalation of breath.  the feet 
move on.
