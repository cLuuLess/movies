37 int. federal building - day 37 
minella and court walk frank to the lobby. 
court 
shit.  i knew it.  it is big money. 
fuck!  you need an assistant?  i'm 
ready to get out.  i've lost my 
tolerance for assholic behavior. 
you should see the jerk we're 
covering now... 
court 
'hellfire henry' kent... 
minella 
shh!  somebody wants to pop him... 
court 
which isn't exactly surprising, 
considering what the shithead's
32. 
been saying. 
minella 
yeah!  do everyone a favor... 
(he coughs, 
 ironically) 
as you know, we're nonpolitical 
these days. 
the three men laugh easily together.  they have reached 
the lobby doors. 
court 
(to frank) 
we'll put this stuff through 
washington.  behavioral sciences 
should have something in a few days. 
frank 
thanks. 
(a pause) 
ray? 
court 
yeah? 
frank 
why am i getting all this 
cooperation? 
minella 
she's a big star.  important 
people care about her. 
court 
politics and show business are 
practically the same these days... 
got any crowd photos we can use? 
frank 
i'm trying to keep her away from 
crowds. 
court 
good luck.
