48 int. family room - day 48 
nicki is cutting fruit at the bar.  rachel, very tense, 
is taking the fruit and dropping it into a yogurt drink 
she's making in a blender. 
rory, her choreographer, stands behind her, massaging her 
neck and shoulders.  spector is perched on a bar stool 
like a vulture.  devaney hurries into the room; nicki 
gives him a look. 
rachel 
i want him gone. 
devaney 
what is it now? 
nicki 
he told rachel no sunday brunch 
at charlie's. 
devaney 
no sunday brunch.  that's why you 
called me up here? 
rachel 
that is not it!  it's my money 
and my life and i want him out 
of here. 
devaney 
where is he? 
nicki indicates through the glass door.  devaney walks 
over to it.
39. 
nicki 
on the patio. 
rachel 
he's through messing with my life. 
devaney 
rachel, i'm getting goddamn sick 
of running up here every time he 
steps on your toes. 
(leaning out the 
 glass door) 
farmer!  would you come in here 
a minute? 
devaney walks back toward rachel. 
rachel 
did you know he was nuts? 
spector 
do you know who couldn't get 
past the gates yesterday? 
rachel 
who? 
spector 
robin leach, that's who. 
rory sniggers into the back of rachel's hair, fighting 
off a laugh.  rachel has difficulty keeping a straight 
face, too.  spector glares at them as frank enters from 
the sliding door. 
spector 
you think that's funny?  the 
man talks to 20 million people 
and he can't even get in here. 
frank 
did he have an appointment? 
devaney turns to him. 
devaney 
farmer, what is this about 
brunch at charlie's?  rachel's 
been going there every sunday 
for the last five years. 
frank 
i don't want her doing anything 
she's always done.
40. 
rachel 
(mimicking him) 
'i don't want her doing anything 
she's always done.'  the guy's a 
fanatic. 
devaney 
so are the guys he's protecting 
you from. 
rachel 
excuse me if i don't faint. 
nicki 
think of fletcher -- 
rachel turns on the blender, drowning out nicki's voice. 
frank looks at rachel coolly.  she stares at him 
petulantly, then turns off the blender. 
rachel 
do you know he's got the phones 
bugged?  
spector 
oh jesus, bill. 
rachel 
maybe he gets off listening to my 
calls.  all that heavy breathing... 
devaney 
(interrupting) 
what do you want from my life? 
rachel 
i want some peace around here. 
spector 
that's right. 
devaney looks at frank imploringly. 
frank 
we're almost done. 
rachel 
and i want to be able to eat 
brunch with my friends. 
frank 
go on tuesday this week. 
spector looks at him as though he were a martian.
41. 
spector 
(stretching it out) 
tuesday -- morning -- brunch. 
where did you find this guy? 
rachel turns on the blender and stares at frank. 
48a ext. thrift shop - valley - day 48a 
rachel's limousine is parked opposite the shop.  it's 
a decidedly downscale area.  a little way off, a group 
of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the limo with 
interest.  henry sits at the wheel.  tony stands by the 
open window, leaning against the car. 
henry 
(looking at the 
 youths) 
i wish rachel didn't keep coming 
here.  it makes me nervous. 
tony 
me too.  'cept i'm not nervous 
'cos i got you with me.
