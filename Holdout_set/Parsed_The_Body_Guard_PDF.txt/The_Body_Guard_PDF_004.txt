5 int. klingman's office den - night 5 
in a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint- 
ings that reflect klingman's success as an arbitrageur, 
he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with farmer.

klingman 
your hands ever shake, frank? 
frank 
sometimes.  it's just adrenaline. 
klingman 
... how did you know? 
frank 
i saw him washing the car. 
klingman 
i saw him. 
frank 
they don't wash cars on the 
parking levels. 
he hands a glass of brandy to frank, who looks at it. 
klingman 
you know, i'd like you to stay on. 
he passes a small sealed envelope to frank. 
frank 
i'm not good in permanent 
positions, my feet go to sleep. 
the two men smile at each other.  they raise their glasses 
in a joint salutation -- klingman drinks.  frank doesn't.
