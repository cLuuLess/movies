67 ext. the mayan - night 67 
tony bursts out the front door and begins cutting a 
swath through the crowd.  rain beats down. 
tony 
make way here.  outta the way! 
a burly street regular gets a shove from tony and comes 
back hard.  the crowd immediately sides with him, yells 
encouragement.  but tony is the better man and sends him 
sprawling.  the rest of the way to the curb opens up. 
at the parking area tony discovers there is no limo and 
turns in bewilderment to rachel.  but she is not there. 
a couple of people laugh.
