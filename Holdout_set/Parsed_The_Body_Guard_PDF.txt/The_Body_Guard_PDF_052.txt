54 int. limo - night (later) 54 
frank rides beside tony in the front seat.  the radio 
plays softly in the b.g.  in back, rachel, spector and 
devaney are drinking champagne.  tony burps, smiles 
at frank. 
radio d.j. (v.o.) 
you're listening to k.r.o.k., the 
rock of l.a. and yes we have. 
(more) 
radio d.j. (v.o.)(cont'd) 
we told you we'd crack the case 
of the mystery guest... and if 
you are one of the few who hasn't 
heard, it's rachel at the mayan. 
franks turns up the volume. 
radio d.j. (v.o.) 
rachel marron, tonight, appearing 
as billy thomas' very special 
guest.  but if you don't have a 
ticket, you can forget going 
down there.  police are asking 
us to ask you to stay away.  so 
everybody, please stay cool, 
stay tuned and we'll try to get 
you some interviews after the 
show.  remember, you heard it 
here on k.r.o.k. -- the station 
that delivers. 
frank looks back at spector who silently mouths --
47. 
spector 
it wasn't me. 
the car turns a corner and there it is, the mayan only 
fifty yards ahead, a mob of fans spilling out of the 
club, off the sidewalk and into the street. 
tony 
fuckin' a. 
spector whoops with uncontrolled delight from the back of 
the limo.  frank stares ahead in disbelief.  the noise 
of the crowd can be heard as they pull up front.
