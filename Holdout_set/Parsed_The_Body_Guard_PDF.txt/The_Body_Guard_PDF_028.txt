30 ext. marron estate - garage area - day 30 
frank and henry walk toward the closed garages. 
henry 
that depends on what you call a 
'hint.' 
frank 
i don't want anyone on the street 
to be able to look at the cars and 
know who owns them. 
henry leans in a doorway and hits a master switch.  the 
three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence. 
henry 
i don't think there's anything 
here you'd call a 'hint.' 
one at a time the doors go up to reveal: 
first garage -- the cadillac limousine we've seen earlier. 
license:  rachel 2 
second garage -- a gray mercedes.  license:  rachel 3
29. 
third garage -- a jaguar xke in an outrageous pink.  no 
other car in the world is this color.  license:  rachel 1 
frank looks at henry, who is laughing and shakes his head. 
he walks toward the jag. 
frank releases the hood.  he looks inside for a moment, 
then reaches into the guts of the engine.  he fiddles for 
a second, then stands up holding some wires and slams the 
hood shut again.  he gestures toward the other two cars. 
frank 
get new plates for those two.
