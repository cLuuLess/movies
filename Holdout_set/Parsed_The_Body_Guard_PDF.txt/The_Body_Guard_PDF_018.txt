frank is walking rapidly away from the window wall, down 
the slope.  devaney is scurrying to keep up. 
devaney 
farmer, will you wait a minute?  i 
should have told you more.  i'm 
sorry but i was afraid she wouldn't 
go through with it.  i thought i'd 
let the two of you work it out... 
come to an understanding. 
frank 
we did. 
frank starts to walk off.  devaney is grasping at straws. 
devaney 
she's not a bad person, and whether 
she knows it or not, she needs you. 
(a beat) 
you've come this far... would you 
just wait here for one minute.  i 
want to show you something.  please, 
farmer. 
devaney runs back to the house.
