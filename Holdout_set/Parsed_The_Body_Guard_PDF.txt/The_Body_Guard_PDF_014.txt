16 int. marron mansion - day 16 
frank steps into the foyer with emma.  she is a warm, 
matronly woman who does a fine job running the house 
without standing on custom. 
emma 
i'll tell you quite honestly, 
mr. ford, i don't know where 
mr. devaney is.  did he say he'd 
be here? 
frank 
yes. 
emma 
then he probably is.  let me look. 
she leads frank into a large, unused formal parlor.  there 
are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being 
repainted.  on a number of tv screens scattered around, 
rachel's latest video (the one we saw in the opening 
titles) is continuously playing.  the sound of the song 
itself -- "i have nothing" -- comes softly from concealed 
speakers. 
emma 
please make yourself at home.  can 
i get you anything? 
frank demurs and emma disappears back through the foyer. 
frank watches her go, then moves off into the house in 
the opposite direction.  it's obviously undergoing a 
major redecoration.  painters, decorators and designers 
come and go, oblivious to frank's presence.
