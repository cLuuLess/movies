3 ext. hollywood premiere - night 3 
a tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies.  arms 
stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones 
are thrust forward.  a deafening cacophony of "rachel! 
rachel!  rachel!  over here!  over here!  this way, 
rachel!  rachel!  rachel!"  we cannot see the object of 
this frenzy.  we catch a brief glimpse of an attractive, 
well-dressed young woman (nicki), exiting with the other 
celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside 
by the mass of surging fans and media.  her face is calm 
and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.
