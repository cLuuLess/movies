73 int. kitchen - night 73 
frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen, care- 
fully cutting and eating a peach.  the door at the other 
end of the room slams open and tony stalks in, soaking 
wet.  he has just made his way home from the mayan and he 
is boiling.  he sights on frank and moves toward him fast. 
frank just watches until tony is almost upon him.  as 
tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, frank spins 
low out of his seat.  tony's legs are knocked out from 
under him.  he lands hard on his back and finds himself 
looking up at frank, who holds him down with the chair he 
was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed 
against tony's throat.  frank looks down at him question- 
ingly, as if to ask, "had enough?" 
tony scowls and nods.  frank lifts the chair away.  tony 
stands up and faces him.  frank turns away and tony 
throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as frank 
ducks and moves in under it.  he hits tony twice and 
throws him against a cabinet.  tony gets up slowly, looks 
around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall. 
he holds it in front of him threateningly. 
frank shakes his head.  he's getting irritated.  he picks 
up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in 
his hand so he's holding it by the blade.  with the same 
fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at tony. 
it sticks in the wall an inch from tony's ear.  tony 
does a slow take and then lowers his blade.  frank picks 
up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink.  he glances 
at tony. 
frank 
i don't want to talk about this 
again.
