53 ext. marron house - night 53 
frank is showing henry how to check the underside of the 
limo with an angled mirror on a stick.  both are crouched 
beside the vehicle.  a noise makes them look up.  rachel, 
dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from 
the house with spector and devaney.  spector's carrying a 
videotape.  tony follows as they head for the car, where
45. 
frank and henry are waiting.  fletcher stands in the 
doorway, flanked by uniformed security guards.  he waves 
at frank. 
frank 
(to henry) 
i thought it was dinner. 
henry shrugs. 
frank 
(to spector) 
are we going somewhere else? 
spector 
the mayan, frank. 
frank 
what's the mayan? 
spector starts to climb into the limo. 
spector 
it's a club, frank.  come on, 
henry, let's go. 
frank 
spector, you've got to tell me 
about these things. 
spector 
i just did. 
he disappears inside the limo. 
rachel tugs at frank's lapels, looks him up and down, 
brushing something off his shoulder.  frank's annoyed. 
rachel 
nice suit, frank. 
rachel is about to get in. 
frank 
rachel. 
he removes something from his pocket, a small enameled 
cross. 
frank 
i want you to keep this. 
rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused. 
rachel 
for me?  it's beautiful.
46. 
frank 
it's fitted with a radio 
transmitter.  when you close the 
clasp, it sends a signal.  if 
there's ever a problem and we're 
separated, just press it and i'll 
know you need me. 
rachel doesn't know how to respond.  she's stuck for 
words.  spector pokes his head out impatiently. 
spector 
okay, she knows how it works, 
let's get going. 
rachel manages a quick smile to frank as she gets in the 
back.  frank gets in the front beside tony.  the limo 
pulls out.
