40 int. front seat of limo - day 40 
frank sits beside tony, next to the door.  tony speaks 
to him in a near whisper. 
tony 
let me set you straight on a few 
things.  for starters, i love this 
lady... what i do for her i do for
34. 
love.  i'm not some hired fuckin' 
gun who is out to make her life 
miserable. 
while tony speaks, frank's eyes dart to the side mirror; 
his gaze never leaves it. 
frank's pov - black toyota 
appears in the rearview mirror. 
back to scene 
tony

her happiness is everything to me. 
frank speaks while concentrating on the mirror. 
frank

you handle things, tony. 
tony

watch me and you'll learn something.

frank's pov - toyota in rearview mirror 
as the limo turns, the 4 x 4 follows them into the turn. 
angle - frank 
whispers to henry. 
frank 
slow down, very slow. 
henry

frank 
no, just slow down. 
the car slows. 
angle - spector and rachel in back 
they look up from some papers. 
spector 
why are we stopping?  are we here? 
behind them, through the rear window, the 4 x 4 can be 
seen.  sensing something, it makes a sudden tire- 
screeching left turn, disappearing behind them.
