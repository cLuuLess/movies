49 int. thrift shop - close on clothes hanger - day 49 
screeching as it's slid along a metal rack. 
rachel is shopping for bargains, moving along racks of 
discarded clothing. 
rachel 
louise, you've got too much great 
stuff. 
owner 
(from the back of 
 the shop, laughing) 
take it all, darlin'. 
frank leans casually against a wall, not watching rachel, 
but watching the shop, watching the street outside. 
rachel finds something she likes. 
rachel 
wooo!  let me try this on. 
she flicks a glance to frank; he's not looking at her. 
she pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing 
booth, then stops dramatically.
42. 
rachel 
(to frank, indicating 
 the open booth) 
farmer, do you want to come in 
here with me?  just to be safe? 
frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of 
the shop.  rachel's head bobs up and down above the 
curtain as she changes. 
rachel 
you probably won't believe this, 
but i have a reputation for being 
a bitch. 
frank says nothing.  he gazes outside through the store- 
front window and sees henry and tony horsing around next 
to the limo.  a few small boys stand around the car.  one 
of them is climbing onto the hood. 
rachel 
i didn't used to be.  but you get 
known for being a certain way -- 
a way people think you are -- and 
pretty soon you get like that. 
can't help it. 
frank smiles knowingly.  rachel notices. 
rachel 
you don't think so?  you're such 
an expert on famous people? 
frank 
i've seen a few. 
rachel 
and you disagree? 
frank 
(very flat) 
you can be as you choose to be. 
it's an act of discipline 
sometimes, but it can be done. 
rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and 
looks at herself in the mirror.  also reflected in the 
mirror is frank. 
rachel 
that why you never stay with one 
of your clients?  they too 
undisciplined for you?  or is it 
you're afraid you'll start to 
care about them?
43. 
frank 
(without interest) 
that's right. 
rachel turns to frank. 
rachel 
can't you answer straight just 
once?  why don't you talk to 
me?  i'm not such a bad lady. 
frank 
you're too clever for me.  i can't 
keep up. 
frank continues to search the shop and street with his 
gaze.  rachel steps closer to him. 
rachel 
look at me, farmer! 
frank turns and looks at her. 
rachel 
you don't approve of me, do you? 
frank 
disapproval's a luxury i can't 
afford.  gets in the way. 
rachel 
don't like emotions getting to you, 
huh?  never mix business with 
pleasure? 
frank 
that's right. 
it's a stand-off.  after a moment, rachel motions to 
an outfit on a rack just behind him. 
rachel 
grab that would you? 
frank takes a beat.  looks out the window. 
frank 
i'm here to keep you alive... not 
to help you shop. 
fuming, rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself, 
whipping the curtain shut behind her. 
a smile plays across frank's face.
44.
