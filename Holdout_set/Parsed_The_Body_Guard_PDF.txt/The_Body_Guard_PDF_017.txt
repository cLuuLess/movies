19 int. family room - day 19 
frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is 
coming from. 
it is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a 
bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth.  it 
is packed with people, props and video equipment.  there 
is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized 
chaos.  music blares out. 
a group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance 
number for a music video, directed by their choreographer 
rory.  sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the 
glass wall at the end of the room.  a video cameraman 
circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a 
large-screen tv behind them. 
in one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a 
proposed costume for the video.  several people are stand- 
ing around, tending to the video and playback gear.  all 
the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't 
immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among 
the big cushions. 
as frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel 
chair turns to reveal devaney.  he waves to frank and 
makes his way over to him. 
on the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his 
late thirties rises to look at frank.  he has a twenty inch 
neck.  devaney signals to him that everything is all right. 
the brawny man looks at frank a moment more, then sits down. 
frank looks around the room.  a shelf laden with vitamins. 
guitars of various makes.  a flute.  a gold record being 
used as a coaster.  people smoking and chatting through 
the rehearsal.
12. 
in one of the chairs, a pretty woman in her mid-thirties 
(nicki, the woman we saw at the premiere) is knitting. 
she glances occasionally at the dancers.  a man sits next 
to a phone busily discussing a contract with someone at 
the other end of the line. 
the music climaxes and abruptly stops.  the dancers hold 
their dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again. 
applause.  the clapping from the front sofa is loudest. 
then laughter. 
from elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the video 
director. 
director (o.s.) 
playback, everybody! 
rachel's voice comes from the sofa. 
rachel (o.s.) 
come here, rory! 
the choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from 
sight.  sound of kissing, laughter. 
the video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather 
round it expectantly. 
rachel (o.s.) 
sugar, that's gonna be great.  i 
love the ending... 
devaney moves to the front of the room.  the playback 
starts behind him.  there are several overlapping 
conversations going on. 
devaney 
rachel... 
rachel (o.s.) 
nicki, how'd you like the number? 
you like the end routine? 
director (o.s.) 
rachel.  you wanna see it back 
from the beginning or just the 
ending... 
nicki, responds to rachel's question. 
nicki 
it was just great, rory... 
but rachel is already replying to the video director.
13. 
rachel (o.s.) 
i wanna see it all.  tony?  i'll 
bet tony loved it. 
the brawny man, tony, shrugs and stands to look at frank 
as he speaks. 
tony 
ehh! 
rachel (o.s.) 
don't worry, rory.  tony doesn't 
appreciate great art.  
the pinned-up girl has been brought forward for rachel's 
approval, elbowing devaney a little to one side. 
dress designer 
(showing the costume) 
what do you think, rachel? 
devaney 
rachel, frank farmer is... 
rachel (o.s.) 
devaney, do you think this is me? 
devaney 
(not looking) 
it's terrific... 
devaney is now facing the unseen rachel. 
devaney 
rachel, frank farmer is here. 
devaney nods in frank's direction.  nicki looks at frank. 
rachel (o.s.) 
who's here? 
devaney 
frank farmer. 
(getting no response) 
the bodyguard. 
rachel (o.s.) 
i think rory should be my 
bodyguard. 
(to dress designer) 
let's see the back again... 
devaney 
rachel, raise your butt out of 
there and meet this man. 
rachel marron finally rises from the sofa.  it's a bit of
14. 
a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old. 
a young woman.  not beautiful, not ugly.  unique only in 
that she is immediately interesting.  a superstar. 
rachel 
well, i'm up. 
rachel and frank look across the room at each other. 
frank comes forward. 
devaney 
frank farmer, rachel marron. 
rachel offers her hand and they shake.  rachel looks him 
up and down. 
rachel 
you don't look like a bodyguard. 
frank 
what did you expect? 
rachel 
i don't know.  tough guy maybe. 
frank 
this is my disguise. 
rachel 
(smiling) 
well, his timing's good. 
devaney 
this is nicki, rachel's sister 
and personal secretary. 
nicki 
nice to meet you, mr. farmer. 
devaney 
(indicating) 
... tony scibelli. 
tony nods but makes no move to shake hands. 
rachel dismisses the dress designer. 
rachel 
(to designer) 
the back's still not right... 
spector, still on the phone, offers a perfunctory wave. 
devaney 
... sy spector, rachel's publicist.
15. 
rachel 
can we get you a drink? 
frank 
orange juice. 
rachel 
straight?  nicki. 
nicki goes to the bar.  rachel sits and motions for 
frank to sit opposite her. 
rachel 
rory, i'll be with you in a second. 
rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big 
screen video. 
rachel 
listen, this whole thing is bill's 
idea... this sudden obsession with 
protecting me.  tony has always 
handled my security and we've done 
just fine. 
spector (o.s.) 
(into the phone) 
yes, i'll hold but not long... 
rory (o.s.) 
rachel, you want to run through 
your steps before we go again...? 
rachel 
i'll be with you in a second. 
nicki hands frank his orange juice.  she looks at frank as 
she speaks.  
nicki 
i think bill's right, rachel.  it's 
time you took more precautions. 
spector enters the conversation. 
spector 
(one hand covers 
 the phone) 
nicki, i'm sure mr. farmer would 
tell you the number of nuts 
writing fan letters jumps every 
time rachel is on the cover of 
a magazine. 
devaney 
not like this.
16. 
an assistant hands rachel a small sheaf of phone messages, 
some papers for signature and a pen.  rachel checks 
through them and signs as she talks. 
rachel 
relax guys, i said i'd do it.  you 
see what i'm dealing with here? 
i'm willing to go along, as long 
as we all understand each other. 
i'm not going to let this alter 
my life one little bit. 
(to assistant) 
who was this? 
assistant 
(overlapping devaney) 
oh.  that was clive's office. 
they called three times... 
devaney 
honey, that's not going to be a 
problem. 
devaney (cont'd) 
(to frank) 
rachel runs a very informal 
household, we're all on a first 
name basis... 
spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in. 
spector 
...and i'm sure you'll blend in 
just fine.  you can select whatever 
alarm systems you want for the 
house.  some kind of improved 
security for the gate.  what else, 
rachel? 
rachel stands and starts to wander over to rory and 
the dancers. 
frank looks at devaney.  devaney doesn't like the tone 
this is taking. 
rachel 
i think i'm safe when i'm here at 
the house so i guess the main thing 
will be when i go out.  tony will 
be able to fill you in on all that. 
you two will have to work something 
out.  i don't want both of you 
falling all over me everywhere i 
go.  the most important thing is 
this -- i will not allow fletcher 
to be affected by this thing...
17. 
rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her, 
starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion. 
spector 
(punching phone) 
i was just going to cover that. 
we'll have to tell the child you 
have some other function... 
rachel 
i don't want him to think he's in 
prison.  so the house and grounds 
must not be altered in any way. 
he shouldn't be aware that you're 
here.  is that clear? 
frank looks at her a long time, glancing up at devaney 
once. 
frank 
miss marron... 
rachel 
rachel. 
frank 
there's been a mistake.  a 
misunderstanding.  if you'll show 
me the quickest way out, we'll 
save each other a lot of trouble. 
frank's on his way.  someone brings a silver headpiece on 
a stand to rachel.  she ignores it, still looking at frank. 
tony 
you can go past the pool. 
devaney 
shut up, tony.  
farmer 
nice meeting you. 
devaney 
farmer, will you wait a minute? 
spector 
bill, i don't think we should be 
begging this guy for his services. 
devaney 
sy, i'm handling this. 
rachel looks on coolly as frank slides open the glass door. 
devaney 
farmer, will you wait a minute?
