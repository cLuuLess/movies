36 int. f.b.i. los angeles office - conference room - day 36 
the room is dark.  an opaque projector throws an image 
onto a screen; it is a letter threatening rachel's life. 
we hear voices.  one is frank's; the other two belong 
to special agents ray court and terry minella. 
the letter is one of the pasted-up threats we saw being 
assembled earlier.  it reads: 
marron bitch -- you have everything 
i have nothing.  the time is coming 
when you shall die... 
reading as fast as possible, we pick up some vicious 
threats and obscenities, but we don't have time to read 
it all before we... 
cut to: 
frank's face 
illuminated by the screen. 
court (o.s.) 
this is another of the ones we 
think are worth pursuing.  lots of 
work went into it.  no prints. 
we're doing lab work on it.  it 
could be nothing. 
minella's face 
is illuminated above the projector. 
minella 
this is the one you think is tied 
to the doll? 
frank (o.s.) 
that's what her manager thinks.
31. 
court (o.s.) 
this 'i have nothing' business is 
a natural with the record and 
movie and all. 
the projector light goes off and the room light goes on. 
the room is practically bare. 
ray court, a prematurely white-haired, career civil 
servant, raises the window shade.  sunlight streams 
in.  on court's lapel is a tiny p.t. boat pin. 
terry minella, a slight, dark 35-year-old, offers frank 
a cigarette; frank declines, minella lights up. 
court 
i sort of lost track of you after 
washington. 
frank 
yeah. 
court 
how's the private stuff? 
frank 
(noncommittal) 
fine. 
court 
big money, i bet?  huh? 
frank shrugs.  court looks at minella knowingly.
