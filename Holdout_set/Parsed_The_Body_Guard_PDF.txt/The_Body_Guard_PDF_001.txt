1 int. underground garage (new york) - night 1 
frank farmer's face - 
mid to late 30s, peers intently over a smoking gun.  he 
is the bodyguard. 
angle - hit man 
dead on his feet, leans against a car.  a gun drops 
heavily from his hand.  his life ebbs as he slides slowly 
down the car door to his knees then falls forward, face 
down on the cement floor. 
a slow pull back reveals that frank is lying on top of 
klingman.  protectively pressed body to body on the 
filthy cement floor of the garage.  klingman, a handsome, 
50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear 
as his armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil.  there 
is no movement. 
the two men are lying near the right front fender of a 
black limousine.  blood spreads from the body of the hit 
man, a few yards away.  klingman starts to raise himself 
up but farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still 
alert for any further threat. 
main titles begin. 
a beat, and voices are heard o.s.  farmer wheels, snub- 
nosed .357 aimed at them. 
frank 
freeze! 
angle - doorway to garage 
a uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks.  farmer 
lowers his weapon and speaks. 
frank 
(calm, but an order) 
call 911.

the scene.  it tracks away into darkness.
