29 int. marron estate - pool house/ballet studio - day 29 
a small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted 
with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre.  a stereo 
plays exercising music. 
nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch- 
ing exercises.  frank appears outside the window.  nicki 
waves him in.  unseen by frank, a huge st. bernard lays 
in the front of the door.  he muscles his way in, the dog 
never moves, just slides along the floor as frank pushes 
the door open.  frank looks the room over. 
frank 
unusual tactic for a guard dog, 
but effective. 
nicki smiles, gesturing him in. 
nicki 
you can look around if you like. 
frank indicates it won't be necessary.  nicki stops 
working out. 
frank 
i'm sorry to disturb you. 
nicki 
that's all right.  it's an excuse 
to rest.  it's my private place. 
i'm the only one who works out 
around here. 
frank glances at photos on one wall.  most are of nicki 
from years ago; some show her performing with a band.
28. 
nicki 
my own ego wall.  no platinum 
records. 
frank spots a picture of two girls. 
frank 
you and rachel? 
nicki 
when i was a kid, i put a little 
band together.  we played high 
school dances, stuff like that. 
then rachel joined the act.  as 
you can imagine, she was quite a 
little entertainer.  even then, 
she had a way of stopping the show. 
so i kind of quit.  professionally, 
anyway. 
frank 
you never went back? 
nicki 
it was pretty obvious who the 
star in our family was. 
frank looks back at the picture.  nicki smiles.
