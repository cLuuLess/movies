74 ext. marron estate - driveway - dawn 74 
frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate 
house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man- 
sion. 
the grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty. 
we see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being 
covertly observed, stalked.  a twig snaps and he turns 
sharply.  it's rachel.  she's dressed in a soft jumpsuit 
and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him.
59. 
the suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely.  her 
manner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and 
very girlish. 
rachel 
hey!  gotcha, didn't i? 
frank 
hey. 
rachel 
you're probably wondering what i'm 
doing. 
(as frank nods) 
you didn't know i jogged, did you? 
frank shakes his head. 
rachel 
what's the matter?  'fraid i'll 
get picked off in my snazzy running 
suit? 
frank 
no.  i'm afraid i'll have to jog 
with you. 
they both smile. 
rachel 
great.  i guess i can't do it. 
rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment, 
rests a hand on frank's arm to support herself.  she 
removes it quickly. 
rachel 
will you walk with me a little? 
frank nods and they cut off across the grounds. 
rachel 
(hard for her) 
i know this is kinda late, but 
thank you.  i'm really glad you're 
here. 
(she looks at him) 
i'm going to try to cooperate. 
frank 
that would be good. 
they walk in silence for few moments.  when rachel 
finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself, 
nervous.  it's very appealing.  and if it's an act, she's 
a terrific actress.
60. 
rachel 
farmer... i have this problem. 
this minor little problem.  you 
see, i'd like to go out for an 
evening.  just me and a guy.  you 
know... 
(makes a funny face) 
... like a 'date.'  but i can't go 
out on a date because you have to 
be with me every minute.  i mean, 
what if he invited me up to his 
place afterwards?  are you going 
to come, too? 
(a beat) 
so the only thing i can figure is 
for you to take me out. 
(pause) 
so... that's what i was wondering 
... you know.  what do you think? 
but only if you want to. 
frank is bemused. 
rachel 
only if you want to... i'm not so 
bad... 
(looks at him) 
god, this is embarrassing.  i'm 
gonna run up ahead there.  you 
decide. 
she runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above 
them.  he walks up after her.
