39 ext. the ivy - day 39 
rachel attracts the usual stares from passersby.  as 
they reach the limousine, frank continues scanning the 
street.  tony stares at him, uncomprehending. 
tony 
(impatiently) 
hey, let's go. 
frank takes a last look then gets into the front seat 
next to tony. 
frank 
(across tony) 
o.k. henry, let's go. 
tony looks at frank, eyes narrowing. 
from across the street, we see the limo pull away.  as 
the shot clears, the dark shape of another vehicle 
appears, slowly moving into frame over the top of the 
camera.
