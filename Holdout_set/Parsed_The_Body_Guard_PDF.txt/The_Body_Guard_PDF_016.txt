18 int. marron mansion - sun room - day 18 
frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool 
area.  one wall is all glass.  on the opposite wall are 
shelves containing the trophies of rachel marron's career: 
a tony award, three grammy's, gold and platinum records, 
other statuettes and plaques.  among the framed photo- 
graphs of rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and
11. 
her small son, fletcher, dressed in a tuxedo.  both are 
goofing off for the camera with obvious affection.  frank 
looks down at the pool. 
frank's pov 
dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven- 
year old fletcher, the little boy from the photograph, 
dark-haired and fragile.  he is crouched at the side of 
the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long 
speedboat which is cutting across the water.  a nanny 
sits, some way off, embroidering. 
frank's attention is distracted.  a heavier bass musical 
beat comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another 
rachel marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy. 
frank follows the sound.
