               int. the set. day

               nick paces tensely in front of nicole and tito.

                                     nick
                         look, tito. it's not that big a deal. 
                         it's a dream, alright. strange things 
                         happen in a dream. all you have to 
                         do is laugh. why is that such a 
                         problem?

                                     tito
                         why does it have to be a dwarf?

                                     nick
                         what?

                                     tito
                         why does my character have to be a 
                         dwarf?

                                     nick
                         he doesn't have to be a dwarf.

                                     tito
                         then why is he?! is that the only 
                         way you can make this a dream; put a 
                         dwarf in it?

                                     nick
                         no, tito; that's not --

                                     tito
                         have you ever had a dream with a 
                         dwarf in it?! do you know anyone 
                         who's had a dream with a dwarf in 
                         it? no! i don't even have dreams 
                         with dwarves in them! the only place 
                         i've seen dwarves in dreams is in 
                         stupid movies like this! make it 
                         weird; put a dwarf in it. everyone 
                         will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a 
                         dream, there's a fucking dwarf in 
                         it!" well, i'm sick of it. you can 
                         take this dream sequence and shove 
                         it up your ass!

               tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks 
               out. everyone stares at nick who is frozen in stunned silence. 
               finally wanda approaches him hesitantly.

                                     wanda
                         nick?
                              (no response)
                         i can get right on the phone. we'll 
                         try to get another... small person 
                         here as soon as possible.

                                     nick
                         no. he's absolutely right.

               nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence. 
               wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes.

                                     wolf
                         you want to just shoot ellen, nick? 
                         she could be in the dream by herself.

                                     nick
                         no. we're not going to shoot anything. 
                         i'm sorry. thanks for all your help, 
                         but it's over. i can't take it 
                         anymore. i tried to roll with it but 
                         it's time to face the music; i can't 
                         do this. i am not a director. the 
                         shoot is over. i give up.

               nick's speech has the simple eloquence of truth; he is not 
               bitter or self-pitying. he seems unaware of how disturbing 
               this is to the crew. they all stand around him in shock, 
               afraid to move or speak. finally wolf turns to the ac and 
               puts his hand on his shoulder, like a father to his young 
               son.

                                     wolf
                         take the camera off the dolly. start 
                         putting it away.

               everyone watches the ac unfasten the camera in silence. nicole 
               stands alone on the set in her wedding dress, still holding 
               the golden apple. her face is frozen in dismay. suddenly 
               cora comes through the set door and marches up to nicole.

                                     cora
                         give me that apple!

               at the sound of his mother's voice, nick looks up. he sees 
               her snatch the apple from nicole's hand and march back out 
               the door, closing it behind her.

                                     cora
                              (behind the door)
                         i'm ready, nick!
