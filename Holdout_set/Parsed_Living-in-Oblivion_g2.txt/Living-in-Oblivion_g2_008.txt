               int. apt. the scene: take 1. color

               from the moment nick calls "action" the film will cut directly 
               to the shot the set camera is filming. the shot is fluid, 
               graceful and in richly, beautiful color. nicole's performance 
               is very strong; flawed only slightly by her nervousness.

                                     nicole
                         dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
                         it didn't hurt that much but i started 
                         crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
                         me alone. he went over and started 
                         hitting danny.

                                     cora
                         ellen, i have no memory of this 
                         whatsoever.

                                     nicole
                         you were just standing there looking 
                         at me. then you pulled me up and 
                         said, "you're not hurt." like i was 
                         disgusting for faking, for doing the 
                         only thing i could think of to keep 
                         him from hitting me again.

                                     cora
                         i was worried about danny.

                                     nicole
                         you do remember.

                                     cora
                         he was smaller than you.

               nicole turns to cora with the heartbreaking gaze of an 
               abandoned child. nick and the rest of the crew watch in awe.

                                     nicole
                         you were so worried about danny --

               suddenly the boom dips all the way into the shot.
