               int. the dream. take four. day

               nicole stands motionless in her wedding gown.

                                     nicole
                         i am so hungry.

               tito walks in, stares at her hard, then walks around her 
               once with the golden apple just beyond her outstretched hands. 
               he stops and the camera dollies into his close-up. nick 
               watches in hopeful expectation. he waits and waits but tito 
               does not laugh.

               just then the door in the rear set wall opens and cora steps 
               in, looking oddly puzzled.

                                     cora
                         oh, i thought this was the tv room.
