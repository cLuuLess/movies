               int. the set. day

               the smoke blanks out the entire frame. frantic shouts are 
               heard from unseen bodies.

                                     wolf
                         pull the plug! bob! pull the plug!

                                     wanda

                         i got it! i got it!

               the smoke machine emits a loud hiss and dies, filling the 
               room with sudden silence. slowly the smoke begins to clear 
               as the crew moves around muttering and coughing.

                                     wanda
                         clear the set! ellen! tito! please 
                         step off the set!

                                     tito (v.o.)
                         i'm off the set!

                                     nicole (v.o.)
                         so am i.

                                     wanda
                         then who is that? who is that? please 
                         step off the set!

               a pair of fuzzy-slippered feet enter the smoky frame. the 
               camera booms up, passing over a woman's bare shins, a 
               flowered, blue silk housecoat until finally coming to rest 
               on the pleasantly smiling face of cora. this is the same 
               woman who played ellen's mother in part one; she is dressed 
               exactly the same as she was in their scene. the camera pulls 
               back to reveal jeff the intern standing nervously beside her 
               with a red notebook in his hands.

                                     cora
                         hi, nicky.

               nick gapes in utter astonishment.

                                     nick
                         mom!
