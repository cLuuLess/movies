               int. the set. day

                                     nick
                         and, cut. very good. wolf?

                                     wolf
                         chad missed his cue again; the whole 
                         dolly is unusable.

                                     nick
                         yeah, chad. what happened; i thought 
                         you were going to hold back till 
                         "me"?

                                     palomino
                         the more i thought about it the more 
                         it didn't seem right. and i'm 
                         thinking, watch me here, instead of 
                         coming around the bed, what if i 
                         just slip here like this and do the 
                         whole scene lying down?

                                     nick
                         i don't know, that seems a little...

                                     palomino
                         hey, i'm just throwing out ideas 
                         here. trying to get the juices 
                         flowing.

                                     nick
                         nicole, how does that feel to you?

                                     nicole
                         well, i can turn to look at him. but 
                         won't you be shooting the back of my 
                         head?

                                     wolf
                         plus chad is completely out of the 
                         light down there.

                                     palomino
                         hey, wolf; i'm not worried about my 
                         face, man. it's about the acting; 
                         that's all i care about.

                                     wolf
                         it's your call, nick. his acting or 
                         his face.

                                     nick
                         for some reason i was hoping we could 
                         get both.
                              (laughs)
                         i thought that's what we were trying 
                         to do here.

                                     wolf
                         i'll have to set another light.

                                     wanda
                         we're ahead of schedule, nick. i 
                         think we can afford a few minutes to 
                         set a light for mr. palomino.

                                     nick
                         good, let's do it. ellen, damian; 
                         let's talk for a second.

               as nick, nicole, and palomino step off the set wanda speaks 
               to the crew in general.

                                     wanda
                         we'll pause to set this light and go 
                         again right away. how long, wolf?

               wolf doesn't answer, though he stands a mere foot away, 
               watching the gaffer set up a light.

                                     wanda
                         wolf?

               wolf walks away from wanda without a word. the entire crew 
               watches this.
