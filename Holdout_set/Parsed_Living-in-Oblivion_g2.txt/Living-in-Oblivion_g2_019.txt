               int. set apt. the scene: take 5. color

               once again the scene begins. nicole shows the first signs of 
               losing her concentration.

                                     nicole
                         dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
                         it didn't hurt that much but i started 
                         crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
                         me alone. he went over and started 
                         hitting danny.

                                     cora
                         ellen, i have no memory --

               suddenly there is a tremendous explosion sending bits of 
               glass flying through the frame. cora jumps, clutching her 
               chest.

                                     cora
                         oh, god!
