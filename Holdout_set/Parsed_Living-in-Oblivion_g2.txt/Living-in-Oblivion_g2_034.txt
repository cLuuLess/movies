               int. set apt. the scene: pickup 1. color

               the scene begins at the pickup point. miraculously, both 
               cora and nicole are just as concentrated and engaged as they 
               were in the run-through.

                                     cora
                         i was worried about danny.

                                     nicole
                         you do remember.

                                     cora
                         he was smaller than you.

                                     nicole
                         you were so worried about danny. 
                         what about me, mom? why weren't --

               in the middle of this final, delicate moment an insistent 
               electronic beeping is heard.
