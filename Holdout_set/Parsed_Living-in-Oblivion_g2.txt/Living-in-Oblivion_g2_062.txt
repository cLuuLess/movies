               int. off the set. day

               camera is close on nick and palomino.

                                     palomino
                         i'll tell you what this is about, 
                         man. you know why she took a cab 
                         this morning?

                                     nick
                         something came up.

                                     palomino
                         no. she was in my hotel room and she 
                         didn't want you to know it. ok? i'm 
                         sorry it had to come out like this 
                         but i told her this morning "thanks 
                         a lot, it was a lot of fun last night 
                         but let's get something straight -- 
                         it was just a one-time deal," and 
                         she didn't want to hear that. she 
                         wanted more, you see what i'm saying? 
                         it's rejection.
