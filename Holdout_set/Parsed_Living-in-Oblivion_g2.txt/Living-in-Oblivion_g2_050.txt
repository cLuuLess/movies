                                     nicole
                         i've always admired you from afar.

               palomino saunters over and sprawls on the bed, forcing nicole 
               to turn her head completely away from the camera.

                                     palomino
                         admired? that sounds rather 
                         professional.

                                     nicole
                         well, then: loved. how does that 
                         sound?

                                     palomino
                         it sounds like the champagne talking.

                                     nicole
                         i've loved you from the moment we 
                         met.

                                     palomino
                         why didn't you tell me?

                                     nicole
                         we were working together -- i'm sorry, 
                         can we cut, nick?
