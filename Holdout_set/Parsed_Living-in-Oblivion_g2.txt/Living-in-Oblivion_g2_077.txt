                         cut.

                                     wanda
                         that's a cut. going again, nick?

                                     nick
                         yes.

                                     wanda
                         going again, please stand by.

                                     nick
                         ok, ellen, good. you're on to 
                         something there.

                                     nicole
                         no, something's not right. it all 
                         feels fake to me.

               nick's tone with nicole suddenly takes on an almost 
               imperceptible edge, tinged with annoyance.

                                     nick
                         well, it's not fake; it's real. just 
                         remember, you really want the apple. 
                         tito, i still think we could see 
                         more of a laugh at the end.

                                     tito
                         what kind of laugh?

                                     nick
                         just a laugh.

                                     tito
                         show me.

                                     nick
                         oh, ok. a laugh. i'm thinking maybe 
                         like this. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

               everyone watches nick demonstrate the laugh. he seems unaware 
               he resembles a drunken, slightly annoyed idiot.

                                     nick
                         something like that. ok? and remember, 
                         tito, this is a dream. not everything 
                         has to make sense. a laugh right 
                         there heightens our sense of... of...

                                     tito
                         anxiety.

                                     nick
                         exactly. wolf, how was that for you?

                                     wolf
                         i still think it should be hand-held.

                                     nick
                              (snaps)
                         well, god damn it! it's not going to 
                         be! it's on the dolly so just forget 
                         about it!

               there is a strained moment of silence on the set as everyone 
               witnesses this rebuke.

                                     nick
                         and bob, what the fuck is that smoke? 
                         might as well get a couple hamsters 
                         in here blowing smoke rings for 
                         christ's sake.

                         it now. we're going to see some smoke 
                         now.

                         and, lock it up.

                                     wolf
                         nick, could i talk to you for a 
                         minute?

                                     nick
                         what?!

                                     wolf
                         in private.

                                     nick
                              (sighs in exasperation)
                         alright.

               nick follows wolf off the set.

                                     wanda
                         release the lock-up. everyone stand 
                         by.

                                     gaffer
                         we'll see some smoke now.

                                     ac
