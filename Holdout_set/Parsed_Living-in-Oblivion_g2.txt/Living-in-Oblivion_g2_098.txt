                                     nick
                         and cut!!

               general mayhem erupts on the set.

                                     nick
                         wolf, talk to me, man! did you get 
                         it?

                                     wolf
                         got it, nick! everything!

                                     nick
                         the close-up?

                                     wolf
                         perfect. see? that's what i meant 
                         about going hand-held!

                                     nick
                         you're a genius, man! what about the 
                         focus?!

                                     ac
                         nailed it.

                                     wolf
                         fuckin' a!

               wolf slaps the ac's palm, then the gaffer's standing right 
               beside him. he turns gleefully to the next person but seeing 
               it is wanda he rigidly turns away.

                                     wanda
                         going again, nick?

                                     nick
                         how was the sound?

                                     sound
                         i could use another but definitely 
                         acceptable.

               nick runs up to his mother and throws his arms around her. 
               nicole stands beside him.

                                     nick
                         mom, you kook! that was incredible! 
                         did you know we were filming?

                                     cora
                              (testily)
                         of course i knew you were filming.

                                     nick
                         you were great, you're a natural. 
                         and nicole, that was beautiful. don't 
                         you dare tell me that felt fake.

               suddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, nick and 
               nicole embrace. just then wanda steps up.

                                     wanda
                         going again, nick?

                                     nick
                         oh, hold on. let me think a second.

               the set grows suddenly quiet as nick begins pacing rapidly, 
               muttering to himself.

                                     nick
                         can i use it for the dream sequence, 
                         that's the question. does it work 
                         for the dream sequence?

               nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him; 
               nicole in her wedding gown, wolf with his eyepatch, his mother 
               still eating the apple, wanda, the crew.

                                     nick
                         we're going with it, wanda!

                                     wanda
                         alright everyone, listen up. that is 
                         a wrap on scene six.

               the set erupts in applause.

                                     sound
                         hold it! hold it! hold it!

                                     wanda
                         what?!

                                     sound
                         i need to record room tone. i'll 
                         need thirty seconds of silence.

                                     wanda
                         oh, alright! quiet. quiet! shut up!! 
                         thirty seconds of room tone. the 
                         sooner you're quiet the sooner we're 
                         done.

                                     cora
                              (whispers to nick)
                         what's room tone?

                                     nick
                         it's for the sound, mom. we just 
                         have to be quiet.

               at that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a 
               doctor and nurse enter. the nurse carries an extra overcoat. 
               jeff, the driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be 
               quiet.

                                     wanda
                         and roll sound. nobody move.

                                     sound
                         speed.
