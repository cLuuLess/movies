               int. a corner of the set. day

               a dented, ancient smoke machine squats forlornly in the middle 
               of the set. wolf (with eyepatch), the gaffer, ac, boom man, 
               and the sound man stand around it, scrutinizing it intently. 
               wolf seems in an unusually good mood.

                                     wolf
                         alright, guys; special effects today. 
                         could be fun. who knows how to work 
                         this baby?

                                     gaffer
                         it's the old t-160. i used it once 
                         in '85.

                                     ac
                         damn. '85.

                                     wolf
                         what's this?

                                     gaffer
                         that's where the gas goes.

                                     boom
                         no, that's where the oil goes.

                                     gaffer
                         is it?

                                     boom
                         i think so.

                                     gaffer
                         you're right. it's coming back now.

                                     wolf
                         i'm going to let you handle this 
                         one, bob. this is your baby. and 
                         les, if he needs help you give him a 
                         hand. ok, guys? we're all working 
                         together today.

               wolf walks off. the gaffer kneels to inspect the smoke machine 
               closer.

                                     gaffer
                         yup, all coming back now. like riding 
                         a bike. t-160, 1985. 1985, t-160.

                                     ac
                         way to go, bob.
