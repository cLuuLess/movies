                         how did you get here?

                                     cora
                         i took a bus in; went right to your 
                         apartment.

                                     nick
                         how did you get out of your room?

                                     cora
                         oh, i just went right through the 
                         door.

                                     nick
                         it was unlocked!?

                                     cora
                         no, it was locked. i just went through 
                         it. it's something i've learned to 
                         do, nicky. i can walk through just 
                         about anything; like air.

                                     nick
                         mom, you've got to stop doing this. 
                         i'm serious. i'm a little upset with 
                         you. you could have gotten lost, or 
                         hurt.

                                     cora
                         i wanted to see you. i've missed 
                         you.

                                     nick
                         i know, mom; i've missed you too. 
                         but it's not really a good time.

               nicole approaches, holding up the hem of her wedding gown. 
               there is a subtle tension smoldering between her and nick.

                                     nicole
                         they're sending a car. it should be 
                         here in a couple of hours. they didn't 
                         even know she was gone.

                                     nick
                         jesus, i don't believe this.

                                     cora
                         i'm sorry, nick. if i knew there was 
                         going to be a wedding i would have 
                         worn my fucking hat.
