                                     nicole
                         good morning, "mom."

                                     cora
                              (gruff)
                         morning.

                                     nicole
                         sleep well?

                                     cora
                         not a wink.

               cora immediately lights a cigarette. nicole instinctively 
               wrinkles her nose and turns away. cora notices this and makes 
               an exaggerated effort to keep the smoke away from nicole by 
               blowing it hard out the side of her mouth. jeff glances back 
               at the two women in the rearview mirror. no one speaks.
