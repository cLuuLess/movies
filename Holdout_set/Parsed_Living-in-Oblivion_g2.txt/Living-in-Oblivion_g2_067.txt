               int. hotel room. dawn

               nicole snaps awake with a jolt. she glances quickly at the 
               clock which reads 4:35. the sound of the shower still running 
               in the bathroom.

                                     nicole
                         oh, god.

               nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. as the 
               camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right 
               against the lens, turning the image to total blackness.

               the frame is black. the recognizable clatter and clunk of 
               the film crew is heard. wanda's voice is prominent.

                                     wanda
                         don't go out that door!

               suddenly a door opens away from camera and the ac stops, a 
               foot away from the lens. behind him, wanda and the rest of 
               the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. 
               we see now the door and the plywood walls around it are fake.
