               int. set apt. the scene: take 7. color

               the scene begins again. nicole is lifeless; she's merely 
               saying the lines.

                                     nicole
                         dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
                         it didn't hurt that much but i started 
                         crying anyway --

                                     cora
                         i was worried about danny!

               nicole stops cold, completely thrown by cora jumping her 
               line.

                                     nicole
                         i'm sorry, i'm lost...
