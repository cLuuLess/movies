               int. makeup corner. day

               nicole sits before the makeup mirror. lorde, the male makeup 
               artist picks up a tube of preparation h and begins applying 
               it under nicole's eyes just as nick walks up.

                                     nick
                         jesus, what are you doing?

                                     lorde
                         shrinking tissue. that's what this 
                         stuff is for. let that sit for two 
                         minutes, pumpkin; i'll be right back.

                                     nick
                         how'd you get here?

                                     nicole
                         took a taxi.

                                     nick
                         oh. we've been waiting in front of 
                         your apartment for half an hour.

                                     nicole
                         god, i'm sorry, nick. something came 
                         up. i forgot to call. i'm sorry, i 
                         feel like such an asshole.

                                     nick
                         you're just saying that because you 
                         have preparation h on your face.

                                     nicole
                         i never should have gone out last 
                         night. i hate jazz. god, i look 
                         terrible.

                                     nick
                         no you don't.

                                     nicole
                         don't bullshit me, nick.

                                     nick
                         i'm not. you really look beautiful.

               something in nick's voice makes nicole glance up at him. he 
               looks away quickly. the moment is awkward, as if they both 
               realize he has inadvertently revealed something. just then 
               palomino approaches.

                                     palomino
                         hey! how'd you get here, nicole?

                                     nicole
                         i took a cab.

                                     palomino
                         oh, cause we were wondering how you 
                         got here.

               nick looks at both of them in a moment of silence.

                                     nick
                         alright, good; everybody's here. 
                         we'll do a run-through as soon as 
                         you guys are ready.

                                     palomino
                         you got it, chief.

               lorde reenters as nick leaves. palomino sits in the chair 
               beside nicole and lorde immediately begins his makeup. no 
               one speaks.
