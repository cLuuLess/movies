               the gaffer and ac help the still-groggy palomino into the 
               back of the production van. jeff, the driver, watches them 
               in sleepy curiosity.

               with palomino safely propped in a seat, the ac goes back to 
               the set. the gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out 
               of his back pocket and slaps it into palomino's motionless 
               hand.

                         with you, man.

               as palomino stares at him blankly, the gaffer slams the door. 
               the car pulls out.
