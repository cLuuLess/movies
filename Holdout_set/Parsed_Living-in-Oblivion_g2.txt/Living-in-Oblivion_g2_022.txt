               nick joins wanda and wolf on the set couch and chair.

                                     nick
                         what's up?

                                     wanda
                         wolf and i were talking... ellen's 
                         losing it a little bit. you got three 
                         quarters of the scene really, really 
                         incredible in the first take. do a 
                         quick cut-away and all you need is a 
                         pickup of the last part of the scene.

                         wolf?

                                     wolf
                         you know how i feel; i love this 
                         shot. hell, i designed it.

                                     nick
                         then let's just stick with the game 
                         plan, ok? it's a simple shot. we're 
                         going to get it this time, i feel 
                         it.

                                     wanda
                         we're here for you, nick. whatever 
                         it takes.

               nick moves off. wanda stares at wolf who studiously inspects 
               his light meter.

                                     wanda
                         thanks.
