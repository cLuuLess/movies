               int. set building, hallway. day

               the ac bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and 
               walks quickly toward the camera. without knocking he pushes 
               open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.

                                     ac
                         oh. sorry.

               standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off 
               the running faucet is, tito a dwarf. he is dressed in a sky 
               blue tuxedo with tails. a top hat and white gloves rest on 
               the closed toilet seat. tito appears extremely annoyed.

                                     tito
                         what do you want?!

                                     ac
                         i need to use the bathroom. kind of 
                         an emergency.

                                     tito
                         well, fucking knock!!

               tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the 
               ac staring after him in astonishment.

                                     tito
                              (muttering)

                         i'm going to punch somebody in the 
                         balls!
