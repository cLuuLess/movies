               int. set apt. day. b/w

               ws, the living room set. nick, wanda, the rest of the crew 
               standing quietly. nicole glances over at cora and instantly 
               something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. the 
               run-through begins.

               from the moment nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there 
               has been a remarkable change in her. every word now has the 
               stunning clarity of truth. cora is completely engulfed in 
               the moment.

                                     nicole
                         dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
                         it didn't hurt that much but i started 
                         crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
                         me alone. he went over and started 
                         hitting danny.

                                     cora
                         ellen, i have no memory of this 
                         whatsoever.

                                     nicole
                         you were just standing there looking 
                         at me.

               as nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this 
               exquisite moment happening before them. nick's face is lit 
               with rapture.

                                     nick
                              (whispering)
                         roll camera... roll camera.

               he glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind 
               the camera. he whispers frantically to the ac.

                                     nick
                         where's wolf?

                                     ac
                              (whispers)
                         in the bathroom... he doesn't feel 
                         good.

                                     nick
                              (whispers)
                         get him! get him!

               nick turns back to the scene, watching its beauty now in 
               agony.

                                     nicole
                         then you pulled me up and said, 
                         "you're not hurt." like i was 
                         disgusting for faking, for doing the 
                         only thing i could think of to keep 
                         him from hitting me again.

                                     cora
                         i was worried about danny.

                                     nicole
                         you do remember.

                                     cora
                         he was smaller than you.

                                     nicole
                         you were so worried about danny. 
                         what about me, mom? why weren't you 
                         worried about me?

               there is a heavy, stunned silence as the scene ends. nicole 
               and cora are in each other's arms. pam and cybil share a 
               piece of tissue. cut to: an extreme cu of nick.

                                     nick
                         where the fuck is wolf?!!!
