               int. set apt. the couch. day. b/w

               the set is quiet, subdued. nick sits on the couch with nicole 
               and cora. wolf sits groggily behind the camera wiping the 
               sweat from his face. wanda addresses the crew.

                                     wanda
                         ok, listen up. nobody drinks the 
                         milk downstairs. ok? it appears to 
                         be bad.

               nick speaks uneasily to nicole and cora. he is a wreck and 
               his insistent smile of encouragement looks absolutely 
               demented.

                                     nick
                         i've had to, well i've changed the 
                         shot; we're just a little pressed 
                         for time. it'll just be a cu of ellen 
                         for the last part of the scene, 
                         starting with cora's "i was worried 
                         about danny." ok? i'll find a way to 
                         cut this into the fourth take. we 
                         almost had it. that was unbelievable, 
                         both of you. but let's not think 
                         about it. that moment is gone, and... 
                         we'll, we'll get another one. i have 
                         no doubt about it. ok? here we go.

               nick walks over and stands beside the camera.
