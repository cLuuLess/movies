               int. a corner of the set. day

               the gaffer, boom man, and ac kneel around the smoke machine. 
               a can of gas and a quart of oil stand beside them.

                                     boom
                         that's where the oil goes.

                                     gaffer
                         no, that's where the gas goes.

                                     boom
                         i'm tellin' you, bob. that's where 
                         the oil goes.

                                     sound
                         lester, don't you think bob knows 
                         where the oil goes?!

                                     gaffer
                         i don't remember using oil in '85.

                                     ac
                         maybe both the oil and gas go in 
                         there?

               the gaffer and boom man turn and look at the ac for a long 
               moment.

                                     boom
                         i think he's right.

                                     gaffer
                         i think he is too. ok, three parts 
                         gas, one part oil.

               the gaffer and boom man pour liberal amounts of gas and oil 
               into the t-160.
