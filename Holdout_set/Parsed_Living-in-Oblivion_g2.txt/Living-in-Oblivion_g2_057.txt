               int. the set. day

               wanda crosses the set and assumes her position beside the 
               camera. wolf sits behind it, barely a foot away.

                                     wolf
                         my eye is killing me.

                                     wanda
                         put your eyepatch on.

                                     wolf
                         i lost it.

                                     wanda

                                     wolf
                         that little light was set ten minutes 
                         ago.

                                     wanda

                         why didn't you tell me?

                                     wolf
                         hey, you're not worried about the 
                         time, i'm not worried about the time.

                                     wanda
                         oh, i am very worried about the time!

                                     wolf
                         i know you are.

                                     wanda
                         what is that supposed to mean?

                                     wolf
                         what do you think it means?!

                                     wanda
                         i don't know what it means!

                                     wolf
                         oh yes you do, you know exactly what 
                         it means.

                                     wanda
                         i have no idea what you're talking 
                         about! why are you --

                                     wolf
                         you don't understand me, wanda! you 
                         have no idea --

                                     wanda
                         i don't understand you?!! all i do 
                         is take care of you!!!

               nick suddenly runs up just as wolf and wanda are on the verge 
               of blows.

                                     nick
                         hey, hey, hey! what the hell's going 
                         on here?! jesus, wanda. this is a 
                         very intimate scene and a lot of 
                         tension on the set doesn't help. ok? 
                         now, wolf, let's just go through the 
                         first part of the move. damian, on 
                         your new mark. good. close-up, damian; 
                         ellen in the background.

               nick suddenly sees palomino is wearing a black eyepatch.

                                     nick
                         chad, what are you doing?

                                     wolf
                         hey, that's my fucking eyepatch.

                                     palomino
                         wolf, could i borrow it? cause i'm 
                         telling you, nick; it really feels 
                         right. i feel like this guy now, 
                         man.

                                     nick
                         i don't know, chad. i don't think it 
                         works.

                                     palomino
                         you're wrong, man. i'm going to fight 
                         you on this one.

                                     wolf
                         hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and i 
                         don't want anyone wearing it. it's 
                         insanitary.

               palomino removes the eyepatch and tosses it back to wolf.

                                     palomino
                         fine. i'll get my own. nick, send 
                         someone out for an eyepatch. i'll 
                         fucking pay for it myself.

               nick pulls palomino aside and whispers to him confidentially.

                                     nick
                         listen, chad. i didn't want to say 
                         this in front of wolf but it makes 
                         you look a little... gay.

                                     palomino
                         really?

                                     nick
                         yeah, a little bit.

                                     palomino
                         jesus.

               palomino sneaks a glance back at wolf then whispers to nick.

                                     palomino
                         you're right. thanks, buddy. good 
                         call.

                                     nick
                         one second. you need a rehearsal, 
                         wolf?

                                     wolf
                         let's just fucking shoot it!!

                                     palomino
                         el lobo!

               palomino winks at nick and walks back to his new mark, making 
               a barely audible howling sound behind his hand.

                                     nick
                         call it, wanda.

                                     wanda

                                     wanda

                                     nick
