               int. hotel room. dawn

               in the dim light of the hotel room, chad palomino dresses 
               quickly. he is young, handsome, with long blond hair. a woman 
               sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera. the faint sound 
               of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom.

                                     palomino
                         they're waiting downstairs.

                                     woman
                         go ahead, i'll take a taxi.

                                     palomino
                         oh, ok. listen, i've got to tell 
                         you, i had a lot of fun last night, 
                         really, but for me, where i'm at 
                         right now in my life, a relationship 
                         is...

                                     woman
                         chad; hold it. this was a one-time 
                         deal. you know it, i know it. there 
                         is no need for melodrama.

                                     palomino
                         i just thought you might...

                                     woman
                         look, all i ask is that you don't 
                         mention this to anyone.

                                     palomino
                         hey, that's not my style.

                                     woman
                         good.

                                     palomino
                         so, i'll see you on the set.

               palomino slips out the door. the woman falls back onto the 
               bed, turning her face toward the camera. we see it is nicole.

                                     nicole
                         god damn it.

               she lies for a moment, listening to the sound of the shower. 
               the bedside clock reads 4:30 a.m.
