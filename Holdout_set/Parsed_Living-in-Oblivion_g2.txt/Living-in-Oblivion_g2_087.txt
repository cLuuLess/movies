               int. the set. near the camera. day

               wanda and wolf stand beside each other in tense, awkward 
               silence for a long moment.

                                     wanda
                         how are you doing?

                                     wolf
                         good; real good.

               wolf looks as if he's about to burst into tears as nick walks 
               up.

                                     nick
                         how's the smoke machine?

                                     wanda
                         it's dead, nick. i've got calls out 
                         to every effects house in the city 
                         but i just can't seem to locate --

                                     nick
                         forget it. we'll shoot without it.

                                     wanda
                         but nick, it's a dream sequence.

                                     nick
                         that's the way it goes, wanda. we're 
                         just going to have to roll with it. 
                         nothing else we can do. we've got to 
                         roll with it, right, wolf?

               wolf meets nick's eyes and gives an extremely melancholy 
               nod. nick turns to address nicole and tito and the edge 
               immediately slips back into his voice.

                                     nick
                         ok, here we go. ellen, you've got to 
                         keep reaching for that apple. i don't 
                         feel that you really want it. i mean, 
                         christ, how many times do i have to 
                         tell you!

               nicole glares at nick for a moment then abruptly turns and 
               walks off the set. nick stares after her in confusion then 
               quickly follows her.

                                     wanda
                         everyone stand by. nobody move. going 
                         again, right away.
