                         actors working.

                                     palomino
                         great shirt, wanda.

                              (notices wolf's 
                              eyepatch)
                         what happened to your eye?

                                     wolf
                         a little accident.

                                     nick
                         you going to be alright?

                                     wolf
                         i think so.

                                     palomino
                         it looks good on you, man.

                                     nick
                         nicole is standing here, chad, you're 
                         there by the chair. camera is close 
                         on ellen: her first line.

                                     nicole
                         i've always admired you from afar.

                                     palomino
                         admired? that sounds rather 
                         professional.

                                     nick
                         good! "professional," that's the 
                         cue; damian steps up to the bed. 
                         camera pulls back. the scene 
                         continues.

                                     nicole
                         well, then: loved. how does that 
                         sound?

                                     palomino
                         it sounds like the champagne talking.

                                     nicole
                         i've loved you from the moment we 
                         met.

                                     palomino
                         why didn't you tell me?

                                     nicole
                         we were working together. i didn't 
                         want anything to interfere.

                                     palomino

                                     palomino
