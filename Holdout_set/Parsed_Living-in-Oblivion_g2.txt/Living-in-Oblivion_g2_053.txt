               int. the set. day

               palomino tiptoes again back to his spot. nicole raises her 
               head and nods once to nick. she seems to have aroused some 
               real emotion in herself.

                                     nick
                              (with quiet intensity)
                         call it, wanda.

                                     wanda
                         and roll sound.

                                     sound
                         speed!

                                     wanda
                         roll camera!

                                     ac
                         rolling!

                                     clapper
                         scene six, take four!

                                     palomino
                              (suddenly)
                         nick, i just had a great idea!

                                     wanda
                         hold the roll!

                                     nick
                         what is it, chad?

                                     palomino
                         just stop me if i'm out of line here, 
                         but she says "admired from afar," 
                         right? doesn't it make sense to see 
                         damian up close and her "afar?" you 
                         start on a close-up of damian, watch 
                         me here; as she declares her love, 
                         the camera moves with me into this 
                         primo two-shot that you and the 
                         wolfmeister have set up here.

                                     nick
                         what do you think, wolf?

                                     wolf
                         i don't like it. this is ellen's 
                         scene.

                                     nick
                         i don't know; it sort of makes sense.

                                     palomino
                         hey, you did it, man. it's all there 
                         in the writing.

                                     wolf
                         i'd have to relight.

               nick pauses, thinking hard.

                                     wanda
                         we're still ahead of schedule, nick; 
                         if that means anything to you.

                                     nick
                         let's do it.

                                     wolf
                              (to the gaffer)
                         get me a tweenie right here, with 
                         diffusion.

                                     wanda
                         ok, everyone stand by. we're pausing 
                         briefly to set one little light, 
                         then we're going again, right away. 
                         stand-in please for mr. palomino.

                                     gaffer
                         i'll do it.

                                     wolf
                         get the fucking light!
