                                     nicole
                         i know, i'm sorry. but this feels 
                         really awkward; turning all the way 
                         around like this.

                                     nick
                         yeah, i think the lying on the bed 
                         is not quite working, chad. let's 
                         try one with the original blocking.

                                     palomino
                         which one was that? there's been so 
                         many damn changes. could somebody 
                         help me out please?

                                     script
                         the cue for the original blocking is 
                         "professional."

                                     palomino
                              (intimate)
                         thank you. thank you very much.

                                     nick
                         ok, right away. call it, wanda.

                                     nicole
                         nick? could i just have a moment? is 
                         that alright?

                                     nick
                         of course, nicole; are you kidding? 
                         hold the roll, wanda.

                                     wanda
                         holding the roll!

               nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and 
               closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion 
               for the scene. everyone watches her in complete silence.
