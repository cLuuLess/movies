               int. the scene. take four

               the scene begins again. palomino milks his close-up for all 
               it's worth.

                                     nicole
                         i've always admired you from afar.

                                     palomino
                         admired? that sounds rather 
                         professional.

                                     nicole
                         well, then: loved. how does that 
                         sound?

               right on his cue, palomino walks to the bed. as the camera 
               moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking nicole's hair with 
               extreme care and concentration.

                                     palomino
                         it sounds like the champagne talking.

                                     nicole
                         i've loved you from the moment we 
                         met.

                                     palomino
                         why didn't you tell me?

                                     nicole
                         we were working together. i didn't 
                         want anything to interfere -- god!

               under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, nicole 
               suddenly jerks her head away hard. palomino jumps up and 
               begins pacing at the rear of the set.
