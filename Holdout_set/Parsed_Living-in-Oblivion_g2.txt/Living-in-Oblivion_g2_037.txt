               int. wanda's apt. dawn

               she is wearing only a bra, black stretch pants, and cowboy 
               boots. she rummages quickly through some blouses, selects 
               the same garish one she wore in part one, then walks away 
               revealing wolf sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. he is 
               dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete 
               with beret. he struggles groggily into his socks and boots. 
               the entire apartment is in disarray. a bedside clock reads 
               4:13 a.m.

                                     wolf
                         well, when did he ask you?

                                     wanda
                         yesterday, when i was helping him 
                         check into his hotel.

                                     wolf
                         what, the guy can't even check into 
                         a hotel by himself?

                                     wanda
                         listen, wolf, having chad palomino 
                         in this movie will benefit us all. 
                         if being there when he checks into 
                         his hotel makes him feel better, 
                         then i'm happy to do it.

                                     wolf
                         well, how did it come up?

                                     wanda
                         he asked me if i liked jazz, i said 
                         yes, and he suggested we meet tonight 
                         at a jazz club.

                                     wolf
                         i like jazz.

                                     wanda
                         he did not invite you.
                              (applies perfume)

                                     wolf
                         why are you wearing perfume to work?

                                     wanda
                         because i feel like it.

                                     wolf
                         you didn't wear it yesterday.

                                     wanda
                         oh, stop it. you're acting like a 
                         child.

               wanda playfully swipes at wolf's face with a negligee she is 
               returning to the closet. it misses him completely.

                                     wolf
                         my eye!

                                     wanda
                         oh, god. sweetheart, are you alright?

                                     wolf
                         do i look alright?!

                                     wanda
                         let me see. christ, we're going to 
                         be late.

               wanda sits and perfunctorily examines wolf's eye.
