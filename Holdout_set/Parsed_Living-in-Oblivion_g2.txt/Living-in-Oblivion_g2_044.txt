               int. the set. take one

               instantly the film cuts from color to b/w. chad and nicole 
               begin their love scene.

                                     nicole
                         i've always admired you from afar.

                                     palomino
                         admired? that sounds rather 
                         professional.

               the camera starts to dolly, however chad does not move. he 
               goes out of frame forcing wolf to pan abruptly to nicole.

                                     nicole
                         well, then: loved. how does that 
                         sound?

                                     palomino
                         it sounds like the champagne talking.

                                     nicole
                         i've loved you from the moment we 
                         met.

                                     palomino
                              (finally moves to his 
                              mark)
                         why didn't you tell me?

                                     nicole
                         we were working together. i didn't 
                         want anything to interfere.

                                     palomino
                         god. and all this time i thought...

               palomino and nicole embrace. their kiss, like the entire 
               scene, is flat, lifeless, and awful.
