               int. wardrobe room. day

               camera is close on nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin 
               white veil is placed on her head. camera pulls back to reveal 
               sachiko, the costume designer putting the finishing touches 
               to nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white 
               wedding gown. nick stands nearby, smoking.

                                     nick
                         just as we pull up to your apartment 
                         palomino suddenly says he feels so 
                         sick he can't work today.

                                     nicole
                         god. was it something he ate?

                                     sachiko
                         stand up, please.

                                     nick
                         i don't know.

                                     nicole
                         can he work tomorrow?

                                     sachiko
                         turn around, please.

                                     nick
                         don't know that either. but i'm not 
                         worrying about it. i had this dream 
                         last night where i was on the set. 
                         you were in it, and another woman, 
                         someone older. anyway, everything 
                         was going wrong. the harder i tried 
                         to hold things together the more 
                         they fell apart. and you know what 
                         that dream was telling me, nicole? 
                         you just got to roll with it. and 
                         that's what i'm doing, i'm rolling 
                         with it. so, we'll just shoot the 
                         dream sequence today.

               just then tito walks in.

                                     nick
                         hey, tito. you look great, man.

                                     tito
                         i feel like shit.

                                     nick
                         no, you look good. thanks for coming 
                         in on such short notice. this is 
                         nicole; she's playing ellen.

                                     nicole
                         hello. toto, is it?

                                     tito
                         tito.

                                     nicole
                         oh, i'm sorry.

                                     nick
                         listen, if there's anything i can do 
                         to make you... if you need... uh, 
                         just let me know.

                                     tito
                         put a stool in the bathroom.

               tito walks out, followed immediately by sachiko, leaving 
               nicole alone with nick.

                                     nick
                         did i just offend him?

                                     nicole
                         what did you say?

                                     nick
                         "short notice?"

                                     nicole
                         come on; that was nothing. i'm the 
                         one who called him "toto." jesus, 
                         i'm out of it. i dreamt i was on the 
                         set last night too.

                                     nick
                         oh yeah?

                                     nicole
                         yeah. you were in the dream.

                                     nick
                         was i freaking out?

                                     nicole
                         actually, you were.

                                     nick
                         that's great: i freak out in my dream;

                         i'm fucking exhausted.

                                     nicole
                         nick...

                                     nick
                         yeah?

               nicole stares at nick for a long moment then smiles briefly 
               and turns away.
