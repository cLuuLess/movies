               int. set. dawn. b/w

               nick -- the director, wolf -- the cameraman and wanda -- the 
               ad, stand in a loose triangle on the darkened set. all are 
               holding coffee cups. the gaffer can be seen in the background 
               fumbling with a light.

                                     nick
                         look, i'm not blaming anybody, wanda. 
                         i'm just saying we left last night 
                         and i knew we didn't get that scene.

                                     wanda
                         i'm sorry, i thought it was a great 
                         scene, nick.

                                     nick
                         it was ok; and it's going to be 
                         alright. but i'm not settling for ok 
                         today. this is a big scene and i'm 
                         not leaving till we get it.

                                     wanda
                         whatever it takes, nick. we're here 
                         for you.

                                     nick
                         alright, here's what i'm thinking. 
                         wolf, i want to do the whole scene 
                         in one shot.

                                     wolf
                         it's been done.

                                     nick
                         i know that but i'd like to try it 
                         anyway.

                                     wolf
                         handheld.

                                     nick
                         no, dolly. we go from close-up to 
                         wide-shot and back to close-up in 
                         the same shot.

                                     wolf
                         i'll use the 35, minimize distortion; 
                         i'll light it all from the ceiling. 
                         it could be kind of great.

                                     wanda
                         sounds incredible. how long, wolf?

                                     wolf
                         i'll need to see a couple run-
                         throughs.

                                     nick
                         not too many. it's a tough scene for 
                         the actors. i want them to feel 
                         relaxed, fresh...

                                     wanda
                         we've got all day, nick. whatever it 
                         takes. what do you think, wolf -- an 
                         hour, 45?

                                     wolf
                         i don't know how you drink that shit 
                         black, nick. i got to dump in the 
                         milk. it's the only way i can cut 
                         the taste.

               suddenly the gaffer turns on the 5k, flooding the room with 
               harsh, blinding light.

                                     nick
                         jesus!

                                     wolf
                         what the fuck?!

                                     wanda
                         flame on, asshole!!

               the screen goes completely white.
