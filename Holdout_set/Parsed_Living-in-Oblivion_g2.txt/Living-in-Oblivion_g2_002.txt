               amid low, one-word greetings, the crew tumbles out of the 
               trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the craft service 
               table. wolf -- the cameraman, assumes a place of prominence. 
               he wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black 
               leather half-fingered gloves.
