               int. the set. day

               the camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. 
               everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. 
               as the silence continues the mood on the set gradually 
               changes. one by one people drift into their own private worlds 
               of reflection.

               ms the sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his 
               stopwatch. behind him the boom man holds the mike in position 
               to record general ambiance while staring off into the 
               distance.

               cu the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision.

               cu the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds 
               have passed.

               ms nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm 
               casually over nick's shoulder. nick glances up and sees nicole 
               beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. suddenly she looks 
               up and her eyes meet nick's. she slips him the barest hint 
               of a smile.

               the camera dollies slowly through the standing, silent group, 
               passing over faces in different degrees of thought.

               cu the sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing 
               ten seconds have passed.

               ms nick. he is so immersed in thought he looks at no one. 
               the camera slowly dollies into a cu of him.
