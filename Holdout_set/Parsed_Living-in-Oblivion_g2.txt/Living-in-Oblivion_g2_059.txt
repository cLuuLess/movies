               int. the set. day

                                     nick
                         cut!

                                     wanda
                         that's a cut. hold the work, going 
                         again, right away.

                                     nicole
                         i'm sorry, nick. i don't know why i 
                         did that. i'm sorry.

               palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses nick with a 
               curtness that is a little startling.

                                     palomino
                         nick, could i talk to you a second?

               palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head 
               indicating his wish for nick to follow him.

                                     wanda
                         a momentary delay. everyone stand 
                         by. we're going again, right away.

                                     sound
                         excuse me, ellen? you were a tad low 
                         on that take.

                                     nicole
                         oh, ok. i'll bring it up. actually 
                         could i listen to the take before?

               the sound man gives nicole his headphones and rewinds the 
               tape recorder for her. the first several lines of the last 
               take are heard through the headphones.
