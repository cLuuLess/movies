               int. wanda's apt. day

               wolf stands like thor in the middle of the red set, his arms 
               crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination. smoke 
               billows around him. at his feet, dressed in nicole's wedding 
               gown, wanda sobs hysterically.

                                     wanda
                         wolf, i'm sorry! please forgive me! 
                         i love you, wolf! please! give me 
                         one more chance. let me prove it! i 
                         love you! i love you, wolf!

               wolf remains unmoved for a long moment. finally he reaches 
               out with a forgiving smile and pats wanda's head.
