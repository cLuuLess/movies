                         i'm sorry about all this, nicole.

                                     nicole
                         it's not your fault, nick. is there 
                         a way to use some of the earlier 
                         takes?

                                     nick
                         not unless i change the shot; do a 
                         cutaway of cora or something and 
                         intercut the takes. i don't want to 
                         do that. it's a really nice shot and 
                         what you're doing is incredible.

                                     nicole
                         thanks, nick.

                                     nick
                         the radio mikes are going to make 
                         everything easier. so, look. take a 
                         moment. let all this shit go. we 
                         don't roll till you're ready.

                                     nicole
                         ok.

               nick moves back to the set, leaving nicole in the shadows. 
               camera stays on her as she begins emotionally preparing 
               herself once again.

                                     script (v.o.)
                         how was she in that richard gere 
                         movie?

                                     cybil (v.o.)
                         so-so.

               camera slips halfway through an open bedroom door, holding 
               nicole on one side of the frame while revealing pam the script 
               supervisor and cybil sitting on the floor smoking. though 
               separated by the wall, nicole hears everything the two women 
               say.

                                     script
                         her career really took off, didn't 
                         it?

                                     cybil
                         i saw her in a michael bolton video.

                                     script
                         she is nice; but i could do a better 
                         job.

               camera slips into a cu of nicole. she closes her eyes as the 
               two women continue talking about her. screen goes black.
