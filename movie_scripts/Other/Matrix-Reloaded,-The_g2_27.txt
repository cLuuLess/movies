back into their stolen forms, and neo is knee-deep in the dead.

he can’t take it. choking, neo struggles to free himself. smiths climb
up the corpse pile and drop onto him, pounding viciously. neo  stalls,
in shock, his eyes  locked with the lifeless  blue eyes of a  woman he
just killed. she looks amazingly like trinity.

perhaps for the first time, he is confronted with the consequences  of
this war, and his mind seizes as the smiths pummel him.

neo goes  berzerk! screaming  and fighting,  he claws  his way out and
surges into the wall of agents. they throw him back, and he can’t kill
them fast  enough. he  leaps upward,  trying to  fly away,  but smiths
cling on to him, and cling on to each other.


ext. plaza

neo struggles to  fly, and as  he does, he’s  pulling a stalagtite  of
black suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet.

cu: neo


his face  is wide  with fear  and shock.  he can’t  climb anymore, and
looks back down at the mountain  of agents he’s pulling into the  air.
his face  clenches shut  as a  scream wells  from deep  within him. he
starts to glow, and we jump back to see:

a massive orange, spherical shock  wave blasts away from his  body. it
rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts  the
smiths away, leaving him clean.

everything slows down  as neo, exhausted,  tumbles out of  the sky. on
his way down  through the neon  light, he passes  bodies flying upward
from the  concussion. neo  hits the  ground, bounces,  and lies still,
sprawled,  as people  drop all  around him,  piling up,  like satan’s
snowfall.
