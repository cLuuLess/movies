int. cockpit (night)

morpheus and  neo sit  together. the  cockpit lights  are dimmed down,
only the emp pulse button glows.  outside the ship, in the dark  mists
of the underworld,  patches of eerie  phosphorescent moss glow  on the
walls. occasionally, a squiddie will pass over the darkened ship.

           the two of them watch the deadly outside world.

                               morpheus

                   "we’re deep in their territory."

                                 neo

                            "i see that."

 morpheus stares out at the night, deep in thought. he turns to neo.

                               morpheus

                          "are you rested?"

                                 neo

                                "yes."

                               morpheus

              "you know now, that you had predecessors."

                                 neo

                      "yes. i’ve heard things."

                               morpheus

                       "what types of things?"

                                 neo

  "that there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be
                  special. but they ended up dead."

                        morpheus nods slowly.

                               morpheus

   "it’s true. there were others. and i didn’t tell you right away.
                     because you were not ready."

                              neo nods.

                               morpheus

                        "does this anger you?"

                                 neo

 "i don’t know yet. so much has happened so fast, that i can’t decide
 whether or not i’m angry, or dissappointed, or even if i should be."

                               morpheus

  "you shouldn’t be, neo. you are the key in the oracle’s prophecy.
     everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing."

                                 neo

                               "what?"

                               morpheus

                   "the destruction of the matrix."

                morpheus looks out into the darkness.

                               morpheus

 "your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world
  for you, and to baptize you by fire. but from here on out, no one
                               knows."

                                 neo

                       "can we ask the oracle."

                               morpheus

                         "not in this life."

                           neo is confused.

                               morpheus

  "no one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day cypher
                            turned on us."

                         neo is taken aback.

                                 neo

           "but she must have known, if they came to her."

                               morpheus

                          "perhaps she did."

                         neo shakes his head.

                                 neo

"i can’t believe it. i don’t know, morpheus, if i’m prepared for this
        war. i’m not a soldier. how, how are we going to win?"

                               morphues

   "for decades, we have fought force-on-force, in the real world,
 without a conclusion. now, after nearly a century of war, we’re at a
standstill. the only way that we can see to win is by destroying their
source of energy. we have to pull the plug on them. we must crash the
                               matrix."

                        morpheus grins slyly.

                               morpheus

  "remember, when i told you, that i’ll show you how deep the rabbit
                             hole goes?"

                                 neo

                                "yes."

                               morpheus

 "i brought you deep, yet i no longer know the way. no one does. with
 every second we sink deeper than before. you are our guiding light,
now. your powers exceed mine a millionfold. i have shown you the path
                  to victory, neo. lead us down it."


int. main deck

morpheus, neo, trinity, choi, and  niobe are on the chairs  as they’re
being jacked in by circa and razor.

cut to: razor jumps in the  operator’s chair, his hands blur over  the
touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates into the matrix.

                           morpheus (o.s.)

            "we’re going straight for the throat, people."

angle on: razor and circa  typing like made at their  keyboards. razor
hits the enter  key. they look  on, transfixed with  anticipation. the
screaming matrix code grinds to a readable halt. the slap each other’s
hands and continue hacking.

                           morpheus (o.s.)

"we have the advantage of surprise. they won’t expect us to return so
                                soon."


int. abandoned warehouse

the five  of them  stand, immobile,  around a  ringing phone  as their
minds filter in to their body images. they are dressed practically  in
denim  and leather,  like blue  collar workers.  their dress  wouldn’t
attract the slightest  bit of attention,  except for the  padded coats
and tote bags filled with firepower.


int. main bridge

                                circa

 "keep your eyes out for changes, they’re modifying things. dial ‘0’
                            for operator."


int. abandoned warehouse

                 morpheus holds his celly to his ear.

                             circa (o.s.)

                        "and have a nice day."

        he drops the phone into his pocket. they turn to him.

                               morpheus

"niobe, you’re the liasion to our operators. neo, what do you have for
                            a game plan?"

                                 neo

                      "where is the mainframe?"

                               morpheus

                      "the metacortex building."

                           neo’s jaw drops.

                                 neo

               "what the fuck? that’s where i worked."

                                 choi

 "and what do you think you were doing there, writing code for video
                games? you were working for the man."

                               trinity

   "it’s true, neo. metacortex employs humans to write code for the
                               matrix."

                                 neo

           "i thought i was working on a fucking database."

                               morpheus

  "they keep the left hand from seeing what the right hand is doing.
 that’s how an evil system can be made by innocent people. but, that
                           doesn’t matter."

                            neo recovers.

                                 neo

"how ‘bout this? i just walk up to the metacortex building and blow it
                                 up?"

                             choi laughs.

                                 choi

                      "what, by power of will?"

        neo nods. choi’s smile fades. he looks to the others.

                                 choi

                         "he’s joking right?"

                      morpheus shakes his head.

                               morpheus

"we’ll fan out around the city, keeping an eye out for you. if you’re
able to accomplish this mission, we’ll phase back into the ship. stay
 in contact. if you lose your cell, contact an operator immediately."
