ext. rest stop (matrix) - sunset

the countach skids  to a stop,  kicking up a  massive dust cloud  that
hides the  car. we  hear the  door slide,  and the  massive black-clad
figure of morpheus emerges from the dust.

                 an uzi in each hand, pointed at us.

the cop behind the wheel is too slow to draw, call for backup, or even
duck for cover. the safety glass is destroyed as gunfire rips  through
it, chewing the cop to pieces. his body thrashes in the seat.

morpheus turns away. niobe pulls up on her bike and gets off,  slowly,
obviously the ride had been  a long one. trinity joins  them. morpheus
stops.

                               morpheus

             "i thought razor said their were two cops."
