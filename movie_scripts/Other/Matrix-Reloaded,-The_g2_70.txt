he  lands  a punch  into  niobe’s stomach,  and  her body  folds  over
unnaturally, as if her back is broken. she crumples to the deck, blood
pouring from her mouth.

morpheus screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of  smith’s
neck,  smashing  the  agent’s  face  down  and  imprinting  it  in the
concrete. for a  moment, smith is  still. morpheus collects  niobe and
runs for the phone booth, which is still ringing.

it’s too far. smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him  forward.
man handling him like he weighs nothing, smith gets on top of him  and
starts smashing his fists down into morpheus’ face.

                                smith

          "i should have killed you the first chance i had."

like an enraged silverback, he raises his fists together for one final
blow. but  instead of  striking, his  eyes catch  something. he  flips
back, jumping, as a silver streak cuts through the air, a split second
too  slow to  cut the  agent’s head  off. instead,  it slices  cleanly
through the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat.

razor, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps  over
morpheus as  he pursues  the agent.  smith rolls  backwards, gains his
footing, and retreats from the  swirling blades of death. he  turns to
morpheus:

                                razor

                                "go!"
