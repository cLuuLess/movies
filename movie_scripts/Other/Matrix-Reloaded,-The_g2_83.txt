morpheus drops the headset on  the operations console. he types  a few
commands on the keyboard, then addresses the crew.

                               morpheus

                  "no one goes in. he’s on his own."

                       he leaves the main deck.

trinity stares at neo for a moment, her face fighting for composure no
one looks at her. she walks away, then leans against the bulkhead, her
body shaking.
