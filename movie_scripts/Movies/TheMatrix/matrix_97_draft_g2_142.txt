int.  executive office - day

agent smith sits casually across from morpheus who is
hunched over, his body leaking and twitching.

                         agent smith
          i'd like to share a revelation that
          i've had during my time here.  it
          came to me when i tried to classify
          your species.  i've realized that
          you are not actually mammals.

the life signs continue their chaotic patterns.

                         agent smith
          every mammal on this planet
          instinctively develops a natural
          equilibrium with the surrounding
          environment.  but you humans do not.
          you move to an area and you multiply
          and multiply until every natural
          resource is consumed and the only
          way you can survive is to spread to
          another area.

he leans forward.

                         agent smith
          there is another organism on this
          planet that follows the same
          pattern.  do you know what it is?  a
          virus.

he smiles.

                         agent smith
          human beings are a disease, a cancer
          of this planet.  you are a plague.
          and we are... the cure.
