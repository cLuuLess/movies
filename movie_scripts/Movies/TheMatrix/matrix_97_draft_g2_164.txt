ext.  government building

trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.

anger boils up into agent smith and he points his gun,
targeting the helicopter.  he'll bring them all down.

the helicopter crabs through the canyon of skyscrapers and
just as agent smith fires --

it disappears behind a building, agent smith's bullets
fracturing the huge panes of skyscraper glass.

                         agent smith
          find them!  track them!
