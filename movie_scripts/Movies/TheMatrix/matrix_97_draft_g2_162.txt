int.  executive office - day

slowly, morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.
when he finally opens his eyes, they are again dark and
flashing with fire.

he rises from the chair, snapping his handcuffs just as
the agents enter the adjoining room.

agent smith stops and sees morpheus run past the open
door.

                         agent smith
          nooo!

he fires sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a perfect
line.

for an instant, we see the bullets shred, puncturing the
wall, searing through the wet air with jet trails of
chalk.

and as morpheus starts his dive for the window, a bullet
buries itself in his leg --

knocking him off balance.

                         neo
          he won't make it.

morpheus lunges, out of control --

as neo spins, every move a whip crack, snapping the other
rope-end on to a bolted bar as --

morpheus begins to fall, when neo hurls himself into the
wide blue empty space --

flying for a moment.

the rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord
attached to a machine.

as their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other
on a seemingly magnetic course until --

they collide.

almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs scrambling,
hands searching in furious desperation, finding hold and
clinging.

until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their fragile
embrace.  morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over, falling
down --

the ground deliriously distant --

as neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed
wrist.

                         neo
          gotcha!
