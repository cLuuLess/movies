int.  room 808 - day

morpheus and agent smith remain on the ground, locked in
each other's death grip.

                         agent smith
          the great morpheus.  we meet at
          last.

                         morpheus
          and you are?

                         agent smith
          smith.  i am agent smith.

                         morpheus
          you all look the same to me.

agent smith counters morpheus and slowly begins to pry his
hands from his throat.

striking like a viper, morpheus drives a vicious head butt
into agent smith's face.  his nose and glasses shatter.

morpheus flips up over agent smith, about to run, but
lands in front of a wall of men.  agent smith rises behind
him, tossing off the broken sunglasses.

                         agent smith
          take him.

the wall of cops rush morpheus, filling the tiny bathroom
until he disappears under the tide.
