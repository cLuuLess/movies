ext.  rooftop - day

the helicopter touches down on the skyscraper in a swirl
of dust and gravel.  neo has an arm around morpheus,
holding him up.

                         trinity
          morpheus!

she runs at him, slamming her arms around him.

                         morpheus
          do you believe it now, trinity?

trinity looks at neo.

                         neo
          morpheus, the oracle... she told
          me --

                         morpheus
          she told you exactly what you needed
          to hear.  that's all.  sooner or
          later, neo, you're going to realize
          just like i did the difference
          between knowing the path and walking
          the path.
