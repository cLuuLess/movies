int.  main deck

neo's body jerks, and everyone hears it as the life
monitors snap flatline.

trinity screams.  morpheus stumbles back in disbelief.

                         morpheus
          no, it can't be.  it can't be.

lasers suddenly sear through the main deck as the
sentinels slice open the hull.
