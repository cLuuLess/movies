they are outside a pawn shop.  trinity has a new cellular.

                         neo
          is morpheus alive?

                         trinity
          is morpheus still alive, tank?

                         tank (v.o.)
          yes.  they're moving him.  i don't
          know where yet.

                         trinity
          he's alive.

again, inevitability seems to cinch around neo.

                         trinity
          we need an exit!

                         tank (v.o.)
          you're not far from cypher.

                         trinity
          cypher, i thought --

                         tank (v.o.)
          so did we.  i sent him to franklin
          and erie.

                         trinity
          got it.
