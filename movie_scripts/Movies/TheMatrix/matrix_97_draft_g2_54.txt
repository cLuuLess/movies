int.  construct - rooftop - day

morpheus and neo are again in the white space of the
construct.  beneath their feet, we see the jump program
rush up at them until they are standing on a rooftop in a
city skyline.

                         morpheus
          let it all go, neo.  fear.  doubt.
          disbelief.  free your mind.

morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop.
and jumps.  he sails through the air, his coat billowing
out behind him like a cape as --

he lands on the rooftop across the street.

                         neo
          shit.

neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at
morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.

                         neo
          okie dokie.  free my mind.  right.
          no problem.

he takes a deep breath.  and starts to run.
