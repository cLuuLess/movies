int.  wall - day

neo listens for a moment, the gunfire quiet when he hears
footsteps rising fast.

two arms suddenly smash through the wall, punching neo
back against the iron stack pipe, fingers gouging into his
neck.

                         neo
          fuck.

his gun clatters down the dark crevice.

                         trinity
          it's an agent!

just as neo's throat is about to collapse, morpheus
explodes through the tattered plaster and lath, diving on
top of agent smith.

the two men crash to the wet terrazzo floor.  before agent
smith can find his weapon, morpheus is on him, pinning him
in an iron grip.

in the crawlspace, trinity tries to scramble up past
cypher.

                         trinity
          morpheus!

morpheus squeezes agent smith's throat.

                         morpheus
          trinity, you must get neo out.  do
          you understand?  he is all that
          matters.

neo suddenly glimpses what is happening but is powerless
to stop it.

                         neo
          no.  no!  morpheus!  don't!

                         morpheus
          trinity!  go!  get to the basement.
          find the catch basin!

behind his crooked glasses, agent smith smiles.

                         agent smith
          the sewers.  of course.

                         morpheus
          hurry!

                         agent smith
          they won't make it.

trinity's fists ball in frustration.  she yells down to
apoc.

                         trinity
          go!

                         neo
          we can't leave him!

                         trinity
          we have to!

she grabs his ankle and they begin almost falling using
the lath as a brake, skidding down the inside of the wall.
