it seems particularly normal.

                         priestess
          make yourself at home, morpheus.

                         morpheus
          thank you.

                         priestess
          neo, come with me.

she leads neo down another hall and into what appears to
be a family room.

there is another woman in white sitting on a couch
watching a soap opera.  scattered about the room are a
half dozen children.

some of them are playing, others are deep in meditation.
all of them exude a kind of zen calm.

                         priestess

                         neo
          what truth?

                         spoon boy
          that there is no spoon.

neo nods, staring at the spoon.

                         neo
          there is no spoon.

                         spoon boy
          then you will see that it is not the
          spoon that bends.  it is only
