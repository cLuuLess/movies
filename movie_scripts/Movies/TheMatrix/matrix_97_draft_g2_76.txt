int.  hall

the long dark hall beckons.  neo follows morpheus out of
the elevator and the doors rattle shut behind him.  with
every step, a disturbing sense of inevitability closes in
around him.

at the end of the hall, morpheus steps to the side of a
door.

                         morpheus
          i told you that i can only show you
          the door.  you have to step through
          it.

neo blows out a breath.  his hand reaches but stops,
hovering over the spherical handle.  he backs away.

                         neo
          morpheus, i don't think this is a
          good idea.

                         morpheus
          why?

                         neo
          i told you i don't believe in this
          stuff.  no matter what she says i'm
          not going to believe it, so what's
          the point?

                         morpheus
          what do you believe in?

                         neo
          what do i believe it?  are you
          kidding me?  what do you think?  i'm
          still trying to deal with the fact
          that everything i believed was real,
          wasn't.  the whole world, my entire
          life was a lie.  i don't know
          anything anymore, morpheus.

                         morpheus
          that's why we're here.

                         neo
          why?  so i can hear some old lady
          tell me, what?  that i'm this guy
          that everybody's been waiting for?
          the one that's supposed to save the
          world?  come on.  how do i respond
          to that?  i can't.  it's ridiculous.
          i mean who am i?  i'm nobody, i'm
          just a guy.  what did i do,
          morpheus?  why me?

                         morpheus
          faith is beyond the reach of whys
          and why nots.  these things are not
          a matter of cause and effect, neo.
          i do not believe things with my
          mind.  i believe them with my heart.
          in my gut.

                         neo
          and you still believe i'm the one?

                         morpheus
          yes i do.

                         neo
          yeah?  what about the other five
          guys?  the five before me?  what
          about them?

morpheus tries to hide his heart being wrenched from his
chest.

                         neo
          did you believe in them too?

                         morpheus
          no.  i did not.  i have never told
          anyone this, neo.  after i saw the
          oracle i thought... no, i
          misunderstood what she told me.  i
          believed that it was all about me.
          that i would find the one, not that
          he would find me.

this is difficult for morpheus to admit.

                         morpheus
          i believed that all i had to do was
          point my finger and anoint whoever
          i chose.  i was wrong, neo.
          terribly wrong.  not a day or night
          passes that i do not think of them.
          after the fifth, i lost my way.  i
          doubted everything the oracle had
          said.  i doubted myself.

he looks up at neo.

                         morpheus
          and then i saw you, on the net,
          searching for me and everything
          changed.  i felt this charge, this
          electricity through my whole body.
          i started laughing and tears poured
          out of my eyes, because i knew, i
          knew that you were the one.

his eyes blaze.

                         morpheus
          listen to me, neo.  i know why
          you're afraid to go through that
          door.  you can't get free of
          thinking that i could be wrong.  you
          must believe me.  there is a
          greatness inside of you, neo.  a
          greatness that is going to lift you
          to unimaginable heights and that in
          time will change the world.

                         neo
          morpheus, i don't know --

                         morpheus
          i know.  that is why it is so
          important for you to go.  please,
          neo, i'm asking you to find whatever
          respect you may have for me and
          trust me.

neo feels a rush from morpheus' intensity, the
unadulterated confidence of a zealot.

                         neo
          all right.

he reaches for the handle which turns without him even
touching it.  a woman wearing white opens the door.

                         priestess (woman)
          hello, neo.  you're right on time.
