int.  construct

neo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.

                         morpheus
          this is the construct.

startled, neo whips around and finds morpheus now in the
room with him.

                         morpheus
          it is our loading program.  we can
          load anything from clothes, to
          weapons, to training simulations.
          anything we need.

morpheus walks past neo and when neo turns he sees the two
leather chairs from the hotel lafayette set up in front of
a large-screen television.

                         morpheus
          sit down.

neo stands at the back of the chair as morpheus sits.

                         neo
          right now, we're inside a computer
          program?

                         morpheus
          wild, isn't it?

neo's hands run over the cracked leather.

                         neo
          this isn't real?

                         morpheus
          what is real?  how do you define
          real?  if you're talking about your
          senses, what you feel, taste, smell,
          or see, then all you're talking
          about are electrical signals
          interpreted by your brain.

he picks up a remote control and clicks on the television.
on the television, we glide over lake michigan towards the
glinting skyscrapers of the windy city skyline circa 1997.

                         morpheus
          this is the chicago you know.
          chicago as it was at the end of the
          twentieth century.  this chicago
          exists only as part of a neural-
          interactive simulation that we call
          the matrix.

he changes the channel and we see a very different chicago
as we enter the television.

                         morpheus
          you have been living inside a
          dreamworld, neo.  as in
          baudrillard's vision, your whole
          life has been spent inside the map,
          not the territory.  this is chicago
          as it exists today.

in the distance, we see the ruins of a future chicago
protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of a
long-dead corpse.

                         morpheus
          'the desert of the real.'

beneath us, the lake is gone.

we turn and descend, spiraling down toward the lake bed
which is scorched and split like burnt flesh, where we
find morpheus and neo.

                         morpheus
          the average temperature in chicago
          these days is minus eighty degrees
          celsius.  of course, the wind chill
          makes it feel like minus one-twenty.

neo clings to the chair, trying to get his bearings.

                         morpheus
          we have only bits and pieces of
          information.  what we know for
          certain is that, at some point in
          the early twenty-first century, all
          of mankind was united in
          celebration.  through the blinding
          inebriation of hubris, we marveled
          at our magnificence as we gave birth
          to a.i.

                         neo
          a.i.?  you mean artificial
          intelligence?

                         morpheus
          yes.  a singular consciousness that
          spawned an entire race of machines.
          i must say i find it almost funny to
          imagine the world slapping itself on
          the back, toasting the new age.  i
          say almost funny.

he looks up and his sunglasses reflect the obsidian clouds
roiling overhead.

                         morpheus
          we don't know who struck first.  us
          or them.  but we do know it was us
          that scorched the sky.  at the time,
          they were dependent on solar power.
          it was believed they would be unable
          to survive without an energy source
          as abundant as the sun.

as we descend into the circular window of his glasses,
there is a flash of lightning.

                         morpheus
          throughout human history, we have
          been dependent on machines to
          survive.  fate, it seems, is not
          without a sense of irony.
