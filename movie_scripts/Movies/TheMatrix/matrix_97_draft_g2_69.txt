int.  main deck

the core glows with monitor light.  cypher is in the
operator's chair as neo comes up behind him.

                         cypher
          whoa!  shit, neo, you scared the
          bejeezus out of me.

                         neo
          sorry.

                         cypher
          no, it's all right.

                         neo
          what are you doing?

                         cypher
          midnight watch.

neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens that
seem alive with a constant flow of data.

                         neo
          is that...?

                         cypher
          the matrix?  yeah.

neo stares at the endlessly shifting river of information,
bizarre codes and equations flowing across the face of the
monitor.

                         neo
          do you always look at it encoded?

                         cypher
          have to.  the image translators sort
          of work for the construct programs
          but there's way too much information
          to decode the matrix.  you get used
          to it, though.  your brain does the
          translating.  i don't even see the
          code.  all i see is blonde, brunette,
          and redhead.  you want a drink?

neo nods and he pours a clear alcohol from a plastic jug.

                         cypher
          you know, i know what you're
          thinking 'cause right now i'm
          thinking the same thing.  actually,
          to tell you the truth, i've been
          thinking the same thing ever since
          i got here.

he raises the glass.

                         cypher
          why the fuck didn't i take that blue
          pill!?

he throws the shot down his throat.  neo does the same and
it almost kills him.  smiling, cypher slaps him on the
back.

                         cypher
          good shit, eh?  dozer makes it.
          it's good for two things:
          degreasing engines and killing brain
          cells.

red-faced, neo finally stops coughing.  cypher pours him
another.

                         cypher
          can i ask you something?  did he
          happen to tell you why he did it?

neo looks up, unsure.

                         cypher
          why you're here?

                         neo
          ... yeah.

                         cypher
          gee-zus!  what a mindfuck.  you're
          here to save the world.  you gotta
          be shitting me.  what do you say to
          something like that?

neo looks down at his drink.

                         cypher
          i'm going to let you in on a little
          secret here.  now don't tell him i
          told you this, but this ain't the
          first time morpheus thought he found
          the one.

                         neo
          really?

                         cypher
          you bet your ass.  it keeps him
          going.  maybe it keeps all of us
          going.

                         neo
          how many were there?

                         cypher
          five.  since i've been here.

                         neo
          what happened to them?

                         cypher
          dead.  all dead.

                         neo
          how?

                         cypher
          honestly.  morpheus.  he got them
          all amped up believing in bullshit.
          i watched each of them take on an
          agent and i watched each of them
          die.  little piece of advice:  you
          see an agent, you do what we do;
          run.  run your ass off.

neo gulps down another shot.

                         cypher
          look, i'm not trying to spook you, i
          just want to help and i'm not going
          to bullshit you.  see, this is the
          real world and the real world ain't
          about heroes and miracles.  this
          world's about one thing:  survival.
          that's all there is.

he throws back a final shot.

                         neo
          thanks... for the drink.

                         cypher
          any time.

cypher nods as neo heads for the ladder.

                         cypher
          sweet dreams.
