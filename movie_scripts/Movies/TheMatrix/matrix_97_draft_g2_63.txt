morpheus slides into the co-pilot's chair next to dozer.

                         morpheus
          how much time, dozer?

                         dozer
          i estimate we'll be within range of
          detection in about two minutes.

morpheus scans the decayed landscape of the sewer main
that rolls by as neo and trinity squeeze into the cockpit
behind him.  morpheus points to a small tributary.

                         morpheus
          set down in there.

                         neo
          what's going on?

                         dozer
          squiddy tripped one of our long
          distance alarm probes.

                         neo
          what?

                         trinity
          a sentinel.  it's a killing machine
          designed for one thing.

                         dozer
          search and destroy.

neo feels the ship rock to the side as it squeezes into a
tiny supply line.
