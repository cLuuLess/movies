int.  government building

morpheus is fighting to hold his mind together.  the
agents stand over him.

                         agent smith
          never send a human to do a machine's
          job.

                         agent brown
          if, indeed, reagan had failed, they
          will sever the connection as soon as
          possible, unless --

                         agent jones
          they are dead.  in either case --

                         agent smith
          we have no choice but to continue as
          planned.  deploy the sentinels.
          immediately.
