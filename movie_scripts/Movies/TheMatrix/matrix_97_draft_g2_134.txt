he walks over to trinity's body, staring down at it
hanging in its coma-like stillness.

                         cypher
          you know, for a long time, i thought
          i was in love with you, trinity.  i
          used to dream about you...

he nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of
it.

                         cypher
          you are a beautiful woman.  too bad
          things had to work out like this.

                         trinity
          you killed them.

                         apoc
          what?!

                         switch
          oh, god.

wearing tank's operator headgear, cypher moves among the
silent bodies.

                         cypher
          i'm tired, trinity.  i'm tired of
          this war, i'm tired of fighting.
          i'm tired of this ship, of being
          cold, of eating the same fucking
          goop every day.  but most of all,
          i'm tired of this jagoff and all of
          his bullshit.

                         trinity
          my god.  morpheus.  you gave them
          morpheus.

                         cypher
          yes.  you see, the truth is,
          trinity, that we humans have a place
          in the future.  but it's not here.
          it's in the matrix.

                         trinity
          the matrix isn't real!

                         cypher
          oh, i disagree, trinity.  i
          disagree.  i think the matrix is
          more real than this world.  i mean,
          all i do is pull a plug here.  but
          there, you watch a man die.

he grabs hold of the cable in apoc's neck, twists it and
yanks it out.

                         cypher
          you tell me which is more real.

apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in
his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then falls
dead.  switch screams.

                         trinity
          but you're out, cypher.  you can't
          go back.

                         cypher
          that's what you think.  they've
          promised to back me, trinity.
          they're going to reinsert my body.
          i'll go back to sleep and when i
          wake up, i'll be fat and rich and i
          won't remember a goddamn thing.
          it's the american dream.

he laughs, his hand sliding around the neck of switch as
he takes hold of her plug.

                         cypher
          welcome to the real world, eh, baby?

she suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she
is murdered.

                         trinity
          goddamn you, cypher!

                         cypher
          don't hate me, trinity.  i'm just
          the messenger.  and right now i'm
          going to prove it to you.

he stands over neo.

                         cypher
          if morpheus was right, then there's
          no way i can pull this plug, is
          there?

she turns to neo, eyes wide with fear and he knows he is
next.

                         cypher
          if he is the one, then in the next
          few seconds there has to be some
          kind of miracle to stop me.  right?
          how can he be the one if he's dead?

he takes hold of the cord.

                         cypher
          you never did answer me, trinity,
          when i asked you before.  did you
          buy morpheus' bullshit?  come on.
          you can tell me, did you?  all i
          want is a little yes or no.  look
          into his eyes, trinity, those pretty
          blue eyes and tell me the truth.
          yes or no.

trinity stares at neo as a single word falls soundlessly
from her lips.

                         trinity
          ... yes.

                         cypher
          no!

cypher is frozen, staring at us in terror.

                         cypher
          i don't believe it!

charred and bloody, tank levels the gun.

                         tank
          believe it or not, you piece of
          shit, you're still going to burn.

he fires a crackling bolt of lightning that knocks cypher
flying backwards.
