int.  car

neo and morpheus get in the car.

                         morpheus
          let's go.

cypher slaps the car in gear and pulls into traffic.
trinity looks at neo who is staring at the final bit of
cookie.  he puts it in his mouth and chews.

                         trinity
          are you all right?

                         neo
          ... right as rain.
