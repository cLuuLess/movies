int.  main deck

everyone is there.

                         morpheus
          this is the main deck.  you know
          most of my crew.

trinity smiles and nods.

                         morpheus
          the ones you don't know.  that's
          mouse, cypher, and switch.  the two
          big guys are tank and dozer.

the names and faces wash meaninglessly over neo.

                         morpheus
          and this, this is the core.  this is
          where we broadcast our pirate signal
          and hack into the matrix.

it is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  vines of
coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic battery
slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks of life
systems and computer monitors.

at the center of the web, there are six ecto-skeleton
chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.

near the circle of chairs is the control console and
operator's station where the network is monitored.

                         morpheus
          you want to know what the matrix is,
          neo?  the answer is right here.

he touches the back of neo's head.

                         morpheus
          help him, trinity.

neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.
he feels morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at
the back of his neck.  the cable has the same kind of
cerebrum chip we saw inside the plant.

                         morpheus
          this will feel a little weird.

there are several disturbing noises as he works the needle
in.

we move in as neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens
into a grimace until a loud click fires and his ears pop
like when you equalize them underwater.

he relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling
of weightlessness inside another place --
