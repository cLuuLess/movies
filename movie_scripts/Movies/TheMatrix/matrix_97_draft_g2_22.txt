int.  car

a large black man named apoc is driving.  beside him is a
beautiful androgyne called switch, aiming a large gun at
neo.

                         neo
          what the hell is this?!

                         trinity
          it's necessary, neo.  for our
          protection.

                         neo
          from what?

                         trinity
          from you.

she lifts a strange steel and glass device that looks like
a cross between a rib separator, speculum and air
compressor.

                         switch
          take off your shirt.

he looks at the strange device and the gun still trained
on him.

                         neo
          what?  why?

                         switch
          stop the car.

apoc does.

                         switch
          listen to me, coppertop!  we don't
          have time for 'twenty questions.'
          right now there is only one rule.
          our way or the highway.

                         neo
          fine.

                         trinity
          no, we can't let him go --

neo opens the door.

                         trinity
          neo, please, you have to trust me.

                         neo
          why?

                         trinity
          because you've been down there, neo.
          you already know that road.  you
          know exactly where it ends.

neo stares out into the dark street beyond the open door.

                         trinity
          and i know that's not where you want
          to be.

                         neo
          ... shit.

he closes the door.
