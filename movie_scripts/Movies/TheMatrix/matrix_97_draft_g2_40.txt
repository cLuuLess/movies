his eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,
trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.

                         neo
          get this thing out of me!

                         trinity
          easy, neo.  easy.

dozer holds him while trinity unlocks it.  once it's out,
he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the
harness.

                         neo
          don't touch me!  get away from me!

on his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.
sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
as if his brain had been put into a centrifuge.

                         neo
          i don't believe it!  i don't believe
          it!

                         cypher
          he's going to pop!

vomiting violently, neo pitches forward and blacks out.
