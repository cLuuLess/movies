int.  apartment building

neo springs up the old crooked apartment building stairs.

                         tank (v.o.)
          now down that hall.

he is halfway down the hall, running in sharp long strides
when a door explodes open at the end.

                         tank
          shit!  the door on your left.

neo lurches, kicking in an apartment door.

                         tank
          no!  other left!

he whirls back to his other left, battering through the
door which splinters, perforated by bullets.

tank barks directions in neo's ear, guiding him zigzag
through the apartment.

                         tank (v.o.)
          right!  straight, then right!

an old woman watches tv as neo blurs past her and into her
kitchen, where another woman is chopping vegetables.

                         tank (v.o.)
          that window!

neo throws it open, leaping for the fire escape just as a
knife buries itself in the window casing.

                         tank
          down!  down!

tumbling down the rattling fire escape, neo leaps the last
ten feet into the alley below with agent brown right
behind him.
