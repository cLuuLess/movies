int.  waste line

the pipe is a waste disposal system and neo falls, sliding
with the clot of gelatin.

banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up
through grease traps clogged with oily clumps of
cellulite.

neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the
flow of waste.

the metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the
belly of the futuristic flying machine hovering inside the
sewer main.
