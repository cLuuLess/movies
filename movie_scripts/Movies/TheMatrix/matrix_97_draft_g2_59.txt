int.  hall

trinity steps out of neo's room to find cypher watching
her.

                         cypher
          i don't remember you ever bringing
          me dinner.

trinity says nothing.

                         cypher
          there's something about him, isn't
          there?

                         trinity
          don't tell me you're a believer now?

                         cypher
          i just keep wondering if morpheus is
          so sure, why doesn't he take him to
          the oracle?  she would know.

                         trinity
          morpheus will take him when he's
          ready.

she turns and he watches her walk away.
