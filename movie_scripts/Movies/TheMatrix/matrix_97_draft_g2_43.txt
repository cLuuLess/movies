int.  neo's room

neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  the
door opens and tank steps inside.

                         tank
          morning.  did you sleep?

                         neo
          no.

                         tank
          you will tonight.  i guarantee it.
          i'm tank.  i'll be your operator.

he offers his hand and neo shakes it.  he notices that
tank doesn't have any jacks.

                         neo
          you don't have...

                         tank
          any holes?  nope.  me and my brother
          dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old-
          fashioned, home-grown human.  born
          free.  right here in the real world.
          genuine child of zion.

                         neo
          zion?

                         tank
          if this war ended tomorrow, zion is
          where the party would be.

                         neo
          it's a city?

                         tank
          the last human city.  the only place
          we got left.

                         neo
          where is it?

                         tank
          deep underground.  near the earth's
          core, where it's still warm.  you
          live long enough, you might even see
          it.

tanks smiles.

                         tank
          goddamn, i got to tell you, i'm
          fairly excited to see what you are
          capable of.  i mean if morpheus is
          right and all.  we're not supposed
          to talk about any of that but if you
          are, well then this is an exciting
          time.  we got a lot to do, so let's
          get to it.
