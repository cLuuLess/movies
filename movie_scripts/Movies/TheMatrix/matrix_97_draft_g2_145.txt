int.  executive office - day

agent smith is again at the window.

                         agent smith
          why isn't the serum working?

                         agent brown
          perhaps we are asking the wrong
          questions.

agent smith hides his knotting fist.  he is becoming
angry.  it is something that isn't supposed to happen to
agents.

                         agent smith
          leave me with him.

agents brown and jones look at each other.

                         agent smith
          now!

they leave and agent smith sits beside morpheus.

                         agent smith
          can you hear me, morpheus?  i'm
          going to be honest with you.

he removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his
shoulder.

                         agent smith
          i hate this place.  this zoo.  this
          prison.  this reality, whatever you
          want to call it, i can't stand it
          any longer.  it's the smell, if
          there is such a thing.  i feel
          saturated by it.  i can taste your
          stink and every time i do, i fear
          that i've somehow been infected by
          it.

he wipes sweat from morpheus' forehead, coating the tips
of his fingers, holding them to morpheus' nose.

                         agent smith
          repulsive, isn't it?

he lifts morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both
hands.

                         agent smith
          i must get out of here, i must get
          free.  in this mind is the key.  my
          key.

morpheus sneers through the pain.

                         agent smith
          once zion is destroyed, there is no
          need for me to be here.  do you
          understand?  i need the codes.  i
          have to get inside zion.  you have
          to tell me how.

he begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.

                         agent smith
          you are going to tell me or you are
          going to die.
