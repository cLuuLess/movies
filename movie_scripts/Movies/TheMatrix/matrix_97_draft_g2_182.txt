int.  cockpit

morpheus climbs into the cockpit.  on the hologram radar,
he sees the sentinels.

                         trinity
          oh no.

trinity is behind him.

                         trinity
          how long?

                         morpheus
          five minutes.  maybe six.

morpheus lifts the headset.

                         morpheus
          tank, charge the e.m.p.

                         tank (v.o.)
          yes, sir.

                         trinity
          you can't use that until neo is out!

                         morpheus
          i know, trinity.  don't worry.  he's
          going to make it.
