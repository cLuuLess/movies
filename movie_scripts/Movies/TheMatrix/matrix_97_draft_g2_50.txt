morpheus begins to press neo, countering blows while
slipping in several stinging slaps.

                         morpheus
          come on, neo.  what are you waiting
          for?  you're faster than this.
          don't think you are.  know you are.

whack, morpheus cracks neo again.  neo's face twists with
rage as the speed of the blows rises like a drum solo.

                         morpheus
          come on!  stop trying to hit me and
          just hit me.

wham.  a single blow catches morpheus on the side of the
head, knocking off his glasses.
