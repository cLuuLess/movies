int.  car

neo sits beside trinity in the back.  he cannot stop
staring as the simple images of the urban street blur past
his window like an endless stream of data rushing down a
computer screen.

                         morpheus
          almost unbelievable, isn't it?

neo nods as the car continues to wind through the crowded
city.

                         neo
          god...

                         trinity
          what?

                         neo
          i used to eat there... really good
          noodles.

he is speaking in a whisper, almost as if talking to
himself.

                         neo
          i have these memories, from my
          entire life but... none of them
          really happened.

he turns to her.

                         neo
          what does that mean?

                         trinity
          that the matrix cannot tell you who
          you are.

                         neo
          but an oracle can.

                         trinity
          that's different.

                         neo
          is it?

                         trinity
          are you worried?

                         neo
          should i be?

                         trinity
          no.

he turns to the window for a moment and then turns back.

                         neo
          did you go to her?

                         trinity
          yes.

                         neo
          what did she tell you?

                         trinity
          she told me...

she looks at him and suddenly she is unable to speak or
even breathe.

                         neo
          what?

the car suddenly jerks to a stop.

                         morpheus
          we're here.  neo, come with me.

neo and morpheus get out of the car.  cypher looks into
the rearview mirror at trinity.

                         cypher
          here we go again, eh, trin?

he smiles as she turns to the window.
