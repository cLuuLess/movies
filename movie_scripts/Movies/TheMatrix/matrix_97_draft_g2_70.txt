int.  mess hall - close on bowl of single-cell protein

a substance with a consistency somewhere between yogurt
and cellulite.

                         tank
          here you go, buddy.  over easy,
          right?

tank slides it in front of neo and takes a seat with the
other crew members enjoying breakfast.

                         apoc
          breakfast of champions, neo.

                         neo
          what is it?

                         tank
          single-celled protein.  we grow it
          in a vat.

the substance jiggles a few moments before coming to a
rest.  neo frowns.

                         mouse
          it's not so bad, long as you don't
          think about liposuction.

mouse sucks at the goo with a straw as morpheus enters.

                         morpheus
          i want everyone on twelve-hour
          standby.  we're going in.  i'm
          taking neo to see her.

with that he turns and leaves.

                         neo
          see who?

                         tank
          the oracle.

trinity glances at cypher who smiles thinly.
