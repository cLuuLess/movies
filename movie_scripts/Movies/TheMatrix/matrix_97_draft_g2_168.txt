int.  subway station - day

an old man sits hunched in the far corner of the station,
shadows gathered around him like blankets.  mumbling, he
nurses from a bottle of thunderbird when --

a phone begins to ring.

neo leads trinity and morpheus bounding over a set of
turnstiles towards the ringing phone inside a graffiti-
covered booth.

                         neo
          let's go!  you first, morpheus.

morpheus gets in and answers the phone.

lost in the shadow, the old man watches as morpheus
disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its cord.  his
eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.
