ext. black gates of mordor - day

angle on: the massive orc army marching towards aragorn's
men.

angles on: aragorn's men . . . starting to waver as the orcs
encircle them. some men are backing away ... losing their
nerve.

aragorn gallops in front of his army . . .

                        aragorn
             hold your ground - hold your ground! sons
             of gondor - of rohan . . . my brothers!

angle on: aragorn . . . he seems to fix each and everyone of
his men with his eyes.

             i see in your eyes the same fear that would
             take the heart of me. the day may come when
             the courage of men fails; when we forsake
             our friends and break all bonds of
             fellowship; but it is not this day - an
             hour of wolves and shattered shields, when
             the age of man comes crashing down - but it
             is not this day!!! this day we fight! by
             all that you hold dear on this good earth -
             i bid you stand!

aragorn holds anduril aloft!
