ext. pass of cirith ungol, tunnel mouth - day

angle on: gollum leads frodo up a long ravine between columns
of torn and weathered rock.

ahead is a great grey wall, a last huge mass of mountain-
stone . . . and in the shadows at the base of the towering rock
lies a tunnel.

frodo reacts to the foul stench coming out of the black hole.

                        frodo
                  (exhausted)
             what is this place?

                        gollum
             master must go inside the tunnel.

                        frodo
             now that i'm here, i don't think i want to.

close on: smeagol sensing his plan unravelling. everything
depends on frodo going inside the tunnel

                        smeagol
             it's the only way.
                  (gollum;- slyly)
             go in - or go back.

frodo stares into the darkness . . .

                        frodo
                  (under his breath)
             i can't go back.

close on: gollum, his sparse oily hair hanging like rank weed
over his hooded eyes ...

drawing a deep breath, frodo follows gollum into the tunnel.
