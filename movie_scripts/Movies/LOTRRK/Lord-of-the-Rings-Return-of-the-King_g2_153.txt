ext. orc road, mordor - night

wide shot: the volcanic wasteland of the gorgoroth foothills.

frodo and sam, still disguised in the orc armour, slide down
scree bank and land on the road below . . . their attention is
fixed on the plain below ... thousands of orcs can be seen
marching away from mt. doom . . .

                       sam
            look, the ores! they're moving off. you
            see, mr frodo - some luck at last.
