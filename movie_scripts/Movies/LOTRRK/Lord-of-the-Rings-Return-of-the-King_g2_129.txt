             splintered . . . a sword day, a red day ^ere
             the sun rises!

angle on: a ray of sunlight escapes through the black clouds,
bathing the rohirrim in golden light. weapons and armour
gleams . . . as 6000 horsemen hold their spears aloft!

below, on pelennor field, the orc kneel and raise their
lances in readiness ...

angle on: eowyn, her arm around merry before her . . .



                                                         (continued)

                         eowyn
                   (terrified)
              whatever happens, stay with me. i'll look
              after you.

merry looks on in shock ...

angle on: as theoden rides past the ranks of soldiers he runs
his lance along their spears ... the noise echoes through the
ranks as the weapons of other riders clatter in response ...

                         theoden
                   (stirring call)
              ride now, ride now, ride, ride for ruin and
              the world's ending!

t h eo de n f ac es hi s e ne my !

                             the oden ( cont'd )
              death!

                         rohirrim
                   (6000 voices)
              death!                               ... ..

close on: merry is swept up in the emotion . .. he whips out
his little sword!

                             theoden
              death!

                             merry
              death!

                             eowyn
              death!

                         theoden
                   (yelling)
              death! forth eorlingas!

all the horns of the rohirrim burst blast upon blast!




                                                              (continued)

angle on: the 6000 rohirrim move off, a great wall of horses
and spear points, building up to a gallop like a rising tide,
as they charge towards the 50,000 orcs!

angle on: merry, wind blowing his hair, eowyn's arm around
his chest . . . as he yells at the top of his lungs !

angle on: gothmog marshalling his troops.

                        gothmog
             fire!

the first volley of arrows hit the rohan soldiers . . . the
charge continues . . .

                        theoden
             charge !

the second volley . . . gothmog watches in horrified awe as the
rohan advance continues . . . sudden fear runs through the orc
and uruk-hai assembled on pelennor field . . . the rohan charge
like men possessed!

angle on: the wall o    f rohirrim horses and spears is seemingly
unstoppable! entire     orc companies vanish under their hooves,
like sand beneath a     foaming breaker, as they race towards the
main body of the orc     army!

angles on: orc archers fire into the thundering rohirrim . . .
orc spears  lower . . . then suddenly the rohirrim crash into
the orcs a nd the screen is filled with hacking, slashing
swords and clashing shields . . .

...    a jaw-dropping sight!
