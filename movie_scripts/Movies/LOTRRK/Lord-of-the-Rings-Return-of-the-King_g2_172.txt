ext. slopes of mount doom - day

wide: like a small grey insect, sam creeps up the slope with
frodo on his back . . . foot by foot.

the mantling cloud swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and
iron crown of barad-dur, the dark tower, in the distance.

close on: sam staggering under frodo's weight . . . strong ash-
laden winds are buffeting him as he slowly climbs mount doom.

the plain of gorgoroth lies 1000 feet below, wrapped in fume
and shadow.

a tremor ripples through the ground . . . a red flame explodes
into the sky . . .

angle on: sam looks up - fearful the mountain could explode
at any moment!

sam pov: through the thick, fume-laden air a set of stairs
can be made out . . .

                      sam
                (growing excitement)
           look, mr frodo! we're almost there!       -.-.

sam can't believe it - relief and joy flood through him . . .

                     gollum
          clever hobbits to climb so high!

smack!. out of nowhere the figure of smeagol crashes into them
sending sam and frodo sprawling.

angle on: smeagol pounces on frodo . . . his fingers wrapping
around his throat, snapping frodo's neck from side to side!

angle on: frodo as he struggles to unlock the bony, white
fingers around his neck but smeagol's grip is too strong.

close on: smeagol's fingers tightening around frodo's neck -
squeezing the life out of him . . .

whack! a rock connects with the side of smeagol's head . . .
