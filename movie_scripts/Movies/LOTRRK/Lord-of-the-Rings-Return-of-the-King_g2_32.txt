int. minas tirith, pippin's quarters - night

angle on: pippin is carefully laying out a small uniform of
the royal guard on a bed.

                     pippin
          so, i imagine this is just a ceremonial
          position . . . i mean, they don't actually
          expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?

wide: gandalf standing quietly on a balcony that overlooks
the great city.

                      gandalf
          you're in the service of the steward now -
          you're going to have to do as you're told,
          peregrin took . . .
               (under his breath)
          guard of the citadel!
