ext. pass of cirith un.gol - night

frodo and sam are now dressed in foul-looking orc gear ...

angle on: frodo and sam turn east and walk over the summit of
cirith ungol ... into mordor.

close on: frodo and sam . . . they stop dead . . . staring ahead:

angle on: mount doom . . . 50 m,iles away - across the barren
gorgoroth plateau - the mountain is erupting streams of ash
and lava high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
mordor with a flickering orange wash.

with immense trepidation, frodo and sam head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom . . .

. . . two tiny figures in a bleak, foreboding landscape. before
them lies the plain of gorgoroth ... their eyes are drawn to
the ominous silhouette of mount doom ...

                      sam
           we did it, mr frodo. we made it to mordor.

angle on: frodo's eyes travel down towards the hundreds of
fires which glow on the plains beneath them ... thousands
upon thousands of orcs are encamped there .

                      frodo
           there are so many of them . . . so many.
           we'll never get through unseen.

their eyes are drawn to a dark looming shape ... barad-dur
. . . a red light seems to sweep across the plain ...

                      frodo (cont'd)
               (terror)
           it's him - the eye.
                                                      (continued)

continued:


the great eye of sauron!

sam cannot see what frodo sees. gently, he urges frodo on.

                       sam
             we have to go in there, mr frodo. there's
             nothing for it. come on. let's just make it
             down the hill for starters.
