int. edoras, golden hall - day

theoden stands in the golden hall, gravely listening to
gandalf ... aragorn, legolas, and gimli look on . . .

                     gandalf
          there was no lie in pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. he told
          sauron nothing of frodo and the ring.

angle on: gimli lets out a sigh of relief.

gandalf turns to look at theoden.

                        gandalf (cont'd)
             we've been strangely fortunate. what pippin
             saw in the palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

gandalf looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       gandalf (cont'd)
             sauron moves to strike the city of minas
             tirith. his defeat at helm's deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

the wizard turns towards aragorn . . .

                        gandalf (cont'd)
             the heir of elendil has come forth. men are
             not as weak as he supposed. there is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

theoden listens intently, saying nothing.

                                    gandalf (cont'd)
                      (wa rningly)
             sauro n        fea   rs this. he             will no t risk            t   he

             groun d        bef   ore he sees              the ret urn of           t   he
             king.

close on: aragorn . . . he knows gandalf speaks the truth.

angle on: gandalf rounds on theoden . . .

                        gandalf (cont'd)
             if the beacons of condor are lit, rohan
             must be ready for war!

theoden holds gandalf's gaze.

                       theoden
                (quietly)
           tell me. why should we ride to the aid of
           those who did not come to ours?

angle on: aragorn turns to look at theoden.

                      theoden (cont'd)
           what do we owe gondor?

                      aragorn
                (low and urgent)
           i will go.

                        gandalf
                 (hurried)
           no!

                      aragorn
           they must be warned.

                      gandalf
           they will be.
                (low voice, to aragorn)
           you must come to minas tirith by another
           ra ...
            od
                (cryptic)
           follow the river, look to the black ships.
                (louder, to all)
           understand this . . . things are now in
           motion that cannot be undone.

gandalf turns on his heel . . . and stares at a surpirsed
pippin.

                      gandalf (cont'd)
           i ride for minas tirith! and i won't be
           going alone !
