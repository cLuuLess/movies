ext. plains of gorgoroth - day

wide on: frodo and sam staggering across the tortured
landscape ... they are no longer wearing the orc armour.

close on: frodo is walking half-bowed, often stumbling . . . as
if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet.

his right hand is pressed against his chest ... supporting a
heavy weight. his left hand often rises, as if to ward off
some invisible blow. sam watches him, concern etched across
his face . . .

close on: frodo as a malevolent voice in his head calls to
him . . . "baggins - baggins" . . .

close on: sam looking behind him in time to see . . .

wide on: a ray of red light stabs through the gloom and
begins to sweep over the barren landscape . . .

sam throws himself to the ground ... frodo turns to the
light, unable to stop himself . . .

frodo crumpling to the ground as the red light hits him like
a searchlight.
