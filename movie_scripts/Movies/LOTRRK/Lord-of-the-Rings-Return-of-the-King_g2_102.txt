pippin has run to faramir and bends towards him ...

                      pippin
                (touching faramir's forehead)
           he's alive!

                      denethor
           the house of stewards has failed! . . .

                (urgently)                                ;

angle on: denethor slowly turning away . . . walking as if in a
trance . . .

close on: denethor has reached the edge of the courtyard . . .
he stares in shocked disbelief at the vista spread out below:

high wide angle: a full view of the orc army . . . from the top
of minas'tirith.

continued:


75,000 orcs are spread out across the pelennor fields like a
sea of black ants.

close on: trolls load the catapults with rocks.

battering rams and siege towers are hauled on chains.
thousands of flickering torches give the army the look of a
moving city in the murky mordor twilight.

close on: denethor . . . struggling to regain the power of
speech!

                        denethor
                  (rasping whisper)
             rohan has deserted us!

angle on: a huge boulder smashes into the wall of minas
tirith.

wide on: boulders hurtle from catapults across the fields
towards minas tirith.

                       denethor (cont'd)
             theoden's betrayed me!

close on: a boulder smashes into a balcony full of civilians.

confusion and panic spreads amongst the soldiers.

                        denethor (cont'd)
                  (panicked scream)
             abandon your posts!

close on: pippin, shocked.

                       denethor (cont'd)

             flee! flee for your lives!

suddenly: thwack!

gandalf's staff smashes into the back of denethor's head!
gandalf grimly swings his staff again, clubbing denethor to
the ground!


                                                       (continued)

angle on: gandalf spins around and addresses the soldiers:

                            gandalf
                     (yell)
                prepare for battle!!
