ext. minas morgul - night

frodo and sam sink to the ground, holding their hands against
their ears, as out of the city comes a rending screech . . .
shivering, rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the
range of hearing. the terrible cry ends, falling back through
a long sickening wail, to silence.

angle on: frodo slowly raises his head . . . across the narrow
valley, directly opposite the hobbits, the lord of the nazgul
- the witch king - suddenly rises up out of the dead city on
his fell-beast!

. .. ,as the witch king settles on the battlements of minas
morgul. his dark head turns this way and that, sweeping the
shadows with unseen eyes - as if sensing the ring !

continued:


angle on: frodo breaking out into a cold sweat. he squeezes
his eyes shut, clutching at his shirt as if it's on fire!

                         frodo .
                  (gasping)
             i can feel his blade!

the cavernous gate of minas morgul swings open ...

. . . and. a huge army marches out!

rank upon rank of armour clad orcs, moving swiftly and
silently, pass close to frodo and sam in an endless stream of
ragged columns!
