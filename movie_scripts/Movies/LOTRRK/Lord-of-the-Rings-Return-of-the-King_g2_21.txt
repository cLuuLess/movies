ext. rivendell forest - day

wide: arwen - escorted by a small entourage of elves - rides

          take her by the safest road. a ship lies
          anchored in the grey havens. it waits to
          carry her across the sea . . . the last
          journey of arwen undomiel.

slow motion: as arwen rides through the forest the figure of
a small boy of about 5 suddenly runs across the path in front
of her.

arwen reigns in asfaloth ... something about the boy
