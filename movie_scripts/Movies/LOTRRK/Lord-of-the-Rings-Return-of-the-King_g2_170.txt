close on: sam crawls to frodo who lies slumped against the
rock-face . . . he turns him over, holding him in his arms.

                         sam
                  (softly)
             do you remember the shire, mr frodo?
             . . . it'll be spring soon, and the orchards
             will be in blossom; and the birds will be
             nesting in the hazel thicket; and they'11
             be sowing the summer barley in the lower
             fields; and eating the first of the
             strawberries with cream.
                  (looking down at frodo)
             do you remember the taste of strawberries?

close on: frodo shuts his eyes, his breath coming in gasps.

                        frodo
                  (weak whisper)
             no, sam. i can't recall    the taste of food;
             nor the sound of water;     nor the touch of
             grass . . . i'm naked in   the dark.
                  (rising panic)
             there's no veil between    me and the wheel of
             fire. i can see it with    my waking eyes.
                                                         (continued)

close on: sam looks at frodo with grim determination.

                       sam
             then let us be rid of it - once and for
             all! come on, mr frodo. i can't carry it
             for you ... but i can carry you! come on!

with that, sam lifts frodo on to his shoulders and starts to
climb mount doom! his plain hobbit-face grows stern, almost
grim, as the will hardens in him.

wide on: two tiny hobbits on the endless shale slopes of the
mountain ...
