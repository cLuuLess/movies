ext. dunharrow plateau - dusk

aragorn joins theoden on a bluff overlooking the encampment
below ...

camera cranes to reveal: thousands of men and horses! smoke
from many small camp-fires has filled the valley with a
twilight haze.

                         theoden
                  (quietly)
             six thousand spears . . . less than half of
             what i had hoped for . . .

angle on: aragorn turns to theoden ...

                       aragorn
             six thousand will not be enough to break
             the lines of mordor.

                     theoden
          more will come.

continued:


                       aragorn                 ;
             every hour lost hastens condor's defeat. we
             have till dawn. then we must ride.

close on: theoden realising what aragorn is saying - no
matter the numbers he must commit to war by the morning.
theoden nods.

the horses whinny loudly in the distance ... theoden looks up
at the mountain which looms behind them . . .
