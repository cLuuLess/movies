int. crack of doom - day

the heat is almost unbearable ... sam sees frodo in the
distance ...

                       frodo
            i'm here, sam.

angle on: frodo is standing on the edge of the crack of doom
. . . a deep lava filled chasm, in the very heart of ancient
sauron's forges, the greatest in middle-earth.

the raging orange glare from the chasm turns frodo into a
black silhouette . . . standing tense and still.

frodo holds the ring in his hand . . . he raises it, holding
it over the bubbling lava far below.-

                       sam
                 (yelling)
            destroy it - go on! throw it in the fire!

close on: frodo . . . a strange expression on his face . . .

                       sam (cont'd)
            what are you waiting for? just let it go!

on the soundtrack: the hum of the ring grows louder and
louder! frodo pulls the ring close to his body as he turns to
sam.

frodo looks at sam, the ring has finally taken him.

                       frodo
            the ring is mine.

sam screams as . . .

...    frodo puts the ring on! he vanishes!

                       sam
            no!        :
