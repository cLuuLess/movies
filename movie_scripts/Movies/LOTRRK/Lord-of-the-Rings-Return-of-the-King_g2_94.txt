ext. pelennor fields/minas tirith - day

angle on: great siege towers and catapults are rolling across
the pelennor fields . . . thousands of flaming torches light
the snarling, slathering morgul orcs . . . marching in ragged
ranks.

angles on: flowing torrents of orcs stream past cave trolls,
beating the drums of war ... minas tirith lies ahead - only
two miles away!
