ext. black gates of mordor - night

angle on: aragorn moves his horse forward.

                    aragorn
          let the lord of the black land come forth;
          let justice be done upon him.

from behind the huge gates, the terrifying chanting and the
clanging of the armour of thousands ...

with the sound of tortured metal, the massive gates begin to
open . . . legolas, merry and eomer look on in trepidation.
