ext. edoras, golden hall - early dawn

aragorn joins legolas on the steps to the golden hall, oblivious
to the chill wind . . . they look out across the sleeping city to
the looming mountain range beyond . .-. dark clouds mark the sky.

                      legolas
           the stars are veiled, something stirs in
           the east . . . a sleepless malice.

legolas looks at aragorn . . . realisation in his face.

                      legolas (cont'd)
           the eye of the enemy is moving.
