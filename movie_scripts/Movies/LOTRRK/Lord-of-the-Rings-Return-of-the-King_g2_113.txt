int. shelob's tunnel - day

frodo nearly gags

                     frodo
          what's that smell?

                        gollum
                  (lying)
             orcses filth! orcses come in here
             sometimes.

they continue on, deep into the dark tunnel . . . frodo is
feeling his way in the dark, following the sound ,of gollum's
scampering.                                            .,;
                                                       ,.
                                                        .

                     gollum o.s..
               (disembodied)
          hurry!

frodo follows the sound of gollum's voice. he is very tired.

                     gollum o.s.(cont'd)
               (disembodied)                              ;и
                                                          ии
                                                           и
          this way.

frodo cannot see gollum in the murky tunnel . . .

                        frodo
             smeagol!

                     gollum o.s.
               (disembodied)
          over here.

continued:


frodo slips as he tries to follow the voice . . . he puts his
hand to the wall to steady himself but quickly yanks it away
... strands of a white thread stuck to his hand.

                        frodo
             it's sticky . . . what is it?

gollum is nowhere to be seen ... only his voice echoes back
down the labyrinth of tunnels.

                         gollum o.s.
             you will see . . . oh, yes . . . you will see.

frodo freezes!

                        frodo
                  (nervous)
             smeagol! smeagol!

no answer, no echo, not even a tremor in the air.

                        frodo (cont'd)
                  (panicked)
             smeagol!

close on: frodo realises with horror that gollum has deserted
him!

                         frodo (cont'd)
                  (whisper)
             sm. . .
              a

close on: frodo breathing hard . . . passing all manner of
creatures, trussed up in evil web-like material . . . .

a bubbling hiss can be heard . . . there is a creaking as some
great jointed thing moves with slow purpose in the dark ...

frodo begins to run in blind panic ...

                                                               cut to:
