int. edoras, sleeping quarters - night

pippin suddenly starts to hyperventilate . . . he staggers
backwards, palantir held rigidly before him . . .

the great eye of sauron seems to leap from the fire . . . pippin
is bathed in the fiery red light.

pippin sinks to his knees, his mouth open in a soundless scream
. . . he falls backwards, powerless to release the fiery globe.

                        merry
             help! someone help him!

gandalf wakes with a start! just as aragorn enters, and
wrenches the palantir from pippin's hands . . . pippin falls to
the floor! . . . aragorn spins away, reeling backwards, the
palantir falling from his hands . . .

the palantir rolls across the floor, causing everyone in the
room to cower back.                                    ;


angle on: gandalf throws a blanket over it, angry disbelief
on his face! he rounds on pippin.                    ,

                        gandalf
             fool of a took!

gandalf lifts the hobbit's slumped head.

                        merry
             pippin!

pippin is trembling ... gandalf calms him . . .

                        pippin
             gandalf! forgive me.

                       gandalf             .
             look at me! what did you see?
