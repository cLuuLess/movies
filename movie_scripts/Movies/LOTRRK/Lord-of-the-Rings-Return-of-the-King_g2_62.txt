close on: frodo tries to clamber up onto the ledge . . . as he
does, the ring slips out of his shirt and dangles in full
view of gollum!

close on: gollum rears back in shock . . . tenses like a cat,
eyes widening.

                        gollum (cont'd)
                  (dreamlike)
             come to smeagol.

angle on: frodo, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. he
doesn't notice gollum's hand reaching for the ring !

close on: gollum's fingers . . . closing in on the ring   ...

angle on: sam, still teetering on the precipitous stairs
draws his sword!

                        sam
                  (alarmed yell)
             mr frodo!

startled, frodo looks down at sam, losing his footing in the
process . . .

                        sam (cont'd)
             get back, you. don't touch him!

angle on: sam's horrified face as . . .

gollum's out-stretched hand suddenly grasps frodo's arm
pulling him safely onto the ledge.

gollum glares down at sam.

                       gollum
             why does he hates poor smeagol? what has
             smeagol ever done to him? master?

close on: gollum blinks, masking the malice of his eyes with
their heavy pale lids.

           master carries heavy burden . . . smeagol
           knows . . . heavy, heavy burden. fat one
           cannot know. smeagol look after master.

close on: gollum creeps close to frodo and whispers in his
ear:

                        gollum (cont'd)
                  (rasping whisper)
           he   wants it - he needs it. smeagol sees it
           in   his eye. very soon he will ask you for
           it   - you will see . . . the fat one will take
           it   from you.

close on: frodo looking at sam . . . his hand strays to his
neck, closing tight around the ring.
