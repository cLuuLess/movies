angle on: frodo, walking arm-in-arm with bilbo through a
beautiful elven boat-house ... gandalf follows with merry,
pippin and sam.

close on: as bilbo looks up, he is stung by the beauty before
hm . . .
 i

                        bilbo
             oh! well, here's a sight i have never·seen
             before.

tracking: passing under a beautiful elven archway . . .

. . . to reveal a white ship, ready to depart from a white
stone dock.

angle on: elrond, celeborn and galadriel are waiting for
them.

the setting sun slowly dropping behind the sea ... visible
between the headlands of a beautiful inlet.

the lighting is beautiful . . . s u n streams through the sails,
casting an ethereal glow on the group as they walk onto the
dock.

bilbo bows in acknowledgement to elrond, celeborn and
galadriel, who return his greeting.

                       galadriel
             the power of the three rings is ended. the
             time has come for the dominion of men.

                        elrond
                  (elvish: with subtitles)
             i aear can ven na mar.

             t he sea calls us ho me.


elrond holds out his arms to bilbo who suddenly seems much
younger and sprightlier . . . he sets off down the path toward
his hosts . . .

                        bilbo
             i think i'm quite ready for another
             adventure.

bilbo walks down toward the boat and boards with elrond . . .

angle on: frodo looks up . . . galadriel is watching him. she
smiles, turns and boards the boat . . .

gandalf kneels before sam, merry and pippin - who are all
looking tearful.

                       gandalf
             farewell, my brave hobbits. my work is now
             finished. here at last, on the shores of
             the sea, comes the end of our fellowship.

there is great sadness . . . merry sniffles loudly.

                        gandalf (cont'd)
             i will not say: "do not weep", for not all
             tears are an evil.

close on: gandalf turns and walks away . . . frodo is downcast
... suddenly, gandalf turns and looks toward him.

                      gandalf (cont'd)
           it is time, frodo.

angle on: gandalf looks at frodo then turns and slowly walks
towards the gangplank to board the ship.

                      sam
                (alarmed)
           what does he mean?

close on: frodo turns to sam. . . .

                       frodo
                (gently)
           we set out to save the shire, and it has
           been saved ... but not for me . . .

                       sam
                (shaken)
           you don't mean that - you can't leave.

angle on: sam looks down . . . frodo is holding bilbo's red
journal out towards him.

                      frodo
           the last pages are for you, sam.

sam is sobbing . . . merry and pippin are distraught . . . .

frodo hugs merry and pippin, and last of all sam . . . and
climbs on board the ship.

angle on: frodo a look of wonderment crosses his face . . . as
he steps forward and accepts gandalf's hand . . . finally
released from his pain, care falls from his face . . . he is
the young frodo we first met so long ago.

sam, merry and pippin comfort each other as the white ship
glides away from the dock ...

wide on: the white boat sails away towards the headlands,
disappearing into the golden light of the setting sun.

angle on: sam in growing darkness, still follows the
departing ship with his eyes, merry and pippin are already
preparing to leave.
