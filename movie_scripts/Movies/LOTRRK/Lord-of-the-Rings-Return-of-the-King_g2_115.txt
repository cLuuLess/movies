int. shelob's tunnel - day

frodo is running blindly . . . he falls, trapped in the sticky
substance which clings to him. as he lays on the ground,
unable to move, a voice comes to him as if froma distant-;,,
memory . . .

                     galadriel v/0
           i give you the light of earendil - our most
           beloved star. may it be a light for you in
           dark places when all other lights go out.

close on: frodo fumbles in his jacket, fear growing in him
. . . he pulls out the glass phial - his gift from galadriel -
he holds it aloft.

                      frodo
                (stronger)
           aiya earendil elenion ancalima!
