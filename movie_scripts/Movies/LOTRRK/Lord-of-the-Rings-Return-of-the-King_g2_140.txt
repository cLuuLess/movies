angle on: merry driving his sword into the back of the witch-
king's knee! merry's sword bursts into flame and his arm is.
shot with pain . . .

eowyn struggles to her feet . . . pulling off her helmet:

close on: eowyn . . . her long hair tumbling onto her
shoulders!

                        eowyn
             i am no man!

with her last strength, eowyn thrusts her sword into the
witch-king's face! eowyn's sword shatters into many shards!

the witch-king topples back dead, a black ooze leaking from
his robes and armour! a shuddering cry, fading into a shrill
wail passes with the wind.

aragorn and legolas battle the orc - legolas jumps onto the
back of a giant mumakil bringing it down ... he lands on his
feet in front of gimli . . .

the mumakil react with terror as spectral warriors climb up
their sides, routing the haradrim from their war-towers!

orcs flee in their thousands ... the terrified mumakil
trampling them in their panic to escape!

angle on: the army of the dead swarming over the city,
routing the orcs!

angle on: eowyn crawls to where theoden lays, mortally
wounded . . .

theoden looks up at eowyn ... his breathing shallow ... his
vision clouded . . .

                        theoden
                  (gasping weakly)
             i know your face ... eowyn ...

eowyn smiles down at him as she gently strokes his face ...

             no . . . i am going to save you ...

                  (loving)
             you already did . . .
                  (clutching her hand)
             my body is broken ... you have to let me go

             company, i shall not now feel ashamed ...

theoden is dying . . .

                         theoden (cont'd)
            eowyn?

theoden dies ... eowyn breaks down, sobbing ... all around is
a vista of defeat.
