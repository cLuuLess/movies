angle on: smeagol and his cousin, deagol, sit in a small
coracle, their fishing lines draped over the side . . . sunshine
glinting off the surface of the water.

an idyllic image.

suddenly . . . deagol's fishing rod bends under the weight of a
large fish.

                        deagol
                 (excited)
            smeagol, i've got one!
                 (he laughs)
            i've got a fish, smeagol!

                       smeagol
                 (excitedly)
            go on, pull it in.

deagol pulls on his rod, but is hauled overboard and
disappears underwater with a splash!

angle on: smeagol leaning over the boat . . . concerned.

                       smeagol (cont'd)
                 (worried)
            deagol!
