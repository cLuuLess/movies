int. edoras stables - dawn

angle on: pippin is dumped unceremoniously onto the back of
shadowfax as gandalf hurriedly prepares to leave . . .

                     pippin
               (nervous)
          how far is minas tirith?

                     gandalf
          three days ride as the nazgul flies and
          you'd better hope we don't have one of
          those on our tail.

merry thrusts a small package into pippin's hand . . .

                     merry
          here - something for the road.

pippin stares down at the leather-bound bundle of pipe-weed.

                     pippin
          the last of the longbottom leaf.

                     merry
          i know you've run out . . . you smoke too
          much, pip.

                     pippin
          but we'11 see each other soon?

a worried merry exchanges glances with gandalf.

                      pippin (cont'd)
          won't we?

                     merry
          i don't know . . . i don't know what's going
          to happen.

gandalf mounts shadowfax.

                     pippin
               (rising panic)
          merry?
                                                      (continued)

                                     final revision - october, 2003 23.
continued:


gandalf spurs the great horse forward.

                       gandalf
             run shadowfax, show us the meaning of
             haste.

                     pippin
               (panicked)
          merry!

shadowfax thunders out of the stables!

close on: merry's devastated face.
