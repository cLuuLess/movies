ext. pass of cirith ungol - day

angle on: frodo stumbles out of shelob's lair . . . tumbling
onto cold rock.

angle on: frodo covered in cobwebs, wild-eyed and drenched in
sweat . . . - h e looks up as gollum lunges at him.  ;:

                       gollum
           got away did it, precious? not this time,
           not this time!

gollum and frodo fight ... rolling on the ground towards the
edge of a precipice . . .

                                                      (continued)

                                       final revision - october, 2003 92.
continued:


frodo pins gollum on the ground, hands around his throat.

                       smeagol
                 (pleading)
             it wasn't us! it wasn't us! smeagol
             wouldn't hurt master.

angle on: frodo's fingers squeeze tighter around gollum's
throat.

                        smeagol (cont'd)
             smeagol promised. you must believe us. it
             was the precious - the precious made us to
             do it.

frodo has a sudden moment of self realisation and releases
gollum, horrified at his violence.

angle on: gollum cowering back . . . coughing and spluttering.

angle on: frodo looking at smeagol, in shock, he gets to his
feet.

                        frodo
                  (shaky)
             i have to destroy it, smeagol. i have to
             destroy it for both our sakes.

smeagol stares at frodo in disbelief . . . in a fury he lunges
at frodo who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge
of the precipice - gollum tumbles over frodo's body and falls
to the bottom of the ravine ...
