ext. desert (day)

from far away, we see gregory and chandra hiding under the only bit of
shade available for miles, a tiny outcropping of rock. we sail in  and
cut to a panning shot, scanning over the harsh ground, onto  chandra’s
feet, clad in gregory’s boots, up her sun-scorched and scratched legs.
she’s collapsed onto gregory. he’s in equally bad shape. gregory leans
with his back against the rock, eyes opening and closing as he  drifts
in and out of sleep.

                             gregory pov

he  stars at  the horizon  and the  mirages of  water reflecting  the
jaundiced yellow sky. in the  shimmering distance, a man appears,  but
gregory’s lids  shut and  we see  darkness. when  he reopens them, the
figure is more clear. it’s a man, dressed in a black suit. even in the
distance we can recognize him. we want it to be him.


ext. desert rock

gregory  can  barely come  to  his senses  as  the figure  approaches.
chandra doesn’t even wake.


ext. desert

we follow the figure at waist heigh as it approaches gregory. it comes
to a stop just in front of him.


ext. desert rock

gregory is fully  awake, but he  thinks he’s dreaming.  he reaches out
and pokes the black-clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him
- a man who doesn’t sweat even in the sauna heat. he looks up, but the
glaring sun obscures the face.

           gregory’s voice is raspy as he starts to speak.

                               gregory

                     "oh my god. it’s... the man."

                             man in black

      "i’ve been searching for you for a long time, my friend."

                       gregory lowers his head.

                             man in black

                       "we need you, gregory."

                               gregory

                             "what for?"

                             man in black

                         "to save our world."

gregory’s face  raises, the  man in  black eclipses  the sun  with his
head, making a hallo of hazy sunlight around an all-too familiar face:
agent smith.

gregory’s head drops back down. he strokes chandra’s hair.

                               gregory

                     "it’s too late. we’re dead."

                             agent smith

                        "do you want to live?"

                               gregory

                             "what for?"

                             agent smith

   "a better life for all. life for her. and for you, a chance for
                              revenge."

                       gregory raises his head.



agent smith grins. he turns away, and the desert landscape before them
turns into a soothing, cool,  crystal forest lake. smith takes  a step
toward it, then turns and extends his hand.

                             agent smith

                            "interested?"

gregory  is  mystified.  speechless, he  drags  himself  to his  feet,
hoisting chandra, and steps toward the lake.

                               gregory

                        "this can’t be real."

           he steps forward, only to have the image recede.

                             agent smith

                        "you this, don’t you?"

                               gregory

                                "yes."

                             agent smith

                         "will you help us?"

                               gregory

                             "anything."

cu:  smith  extends his  hand.  gregory grasps  it.  he lets  go,  and
collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge.


ext. lake shore

the  desert  is  gone,  replaced by  forest,  though  still  under the
poisoned sky of the matrix.

gregory laps  the water  up, and  pulls chandra  in, rubbing the water
over her face. calmly, agent smith stands on the lake shore.

cu:  agent smith.  the humans  are reflected  in his  perfectly still
glasses.

chandra  stirs and  awakens, though  she doesn’t  seem to  see  smith.
gregory,  revitalized, looks  around at  the miracle,  and up  at the
mystery man.

                               gregory

                       "who the fuck are you?"

                       smith grins devilishly.

                             agent smith

  "i’m nobody. a smith. what’s more important, is you. we need you,
                              gregory."

gregory stares. he pulls chandra ashore and stands to look agent smith
in the eyes.

                               gregory

             "first you try to kill me. now you need me."

                             agent smith

   "two years ago, gregory, your parents were killed in a terrorist
                  attack in the heart of the city."

             the words spark something nasty in gregory.

                               gregory

                              "so what?"

                             agent smith

          "the terrorists were led by a certain individual."

                               gregory

                         "i know who it was."

                             agent smith

                      "we need you to kill him."

gregory laughs he turns to chandra  to check on her. she’s passed  out
on the smooth grass.

                               gregory

"what a bunch of bullshit. the whole government can’t kill him, so how
                               can i?"

                             agent smith

           "no one in the government can do what you can."

                               gregory

                             "fuck you."

                             agent smith

                     "i believe we have a deal."

           gregory stands and puts his face next to smith’s

 "you know, i’ve always wanted to fuck the devil on a deal. and this
     looks like a once-in-a lifetime opportunity. so, fuck you!"

smith frowns. gregory looks him up and down. he’s got a few inches and
pounds on the smaller agent.

                               gregory

  "what are you gonna do, little man? you looking for a trip to the
fucking hospital? fuck with me and you’ll be looking for some plastic
                           surgery, you - "

smith delivers a  chest punch that  sends gregory sailing  back twenty
feet. he tumbles to a stop, coughs, and stares in disbelief at  smith,
standing calmly at what seems like an impossible distance away.

cu: smith. he removes his glasses calmly.

cu: gregory. he was stunned, but he’s  not out of the fight. not by  a
long shot.

                               gregory

                        "no man can beat me."

                                smith

                        "bring it on, pussy."

                    pull back as he charges smith

smith is ready to deflect the  blow, but gregory dodges and bowls  him
over, barroom style.  with smith pinned  below him, he  slams his palm
downward. smith’s head dodges the blow that pummels the ground.

gregory is  screaming as  he smashes  downward with  the palms  of his
heels. every blow misses the mark.

                               gregory

                   "mother fucker, what the fu -?"

smith bucks up, throwing gregory into the air. he flips onto his  back
as gregory returns. the  sheer force of his  street-forged roundhouses
knock smith around  as he blocks.  growing irritated at  the untrained
