shots  that  turn  the  squiddies into  curdling  balls  of  slag. the
squiddies that survive turn tail and run.


int. neb cockpit

the crew of the neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they  leave
the scene of aerial carnage behind them.

neo has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. he
relaxes his grip as their escape is clear. their ship suddenly  enters
a cave, and starts  to descend. the blue  wash of the ship  shows rock
walls and pipes. the ships are slowing down as they descend back  into
the earth.

tank's shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.

                                 tank

                            "we're home."

                               trinity

          "well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen."

                                 neo

                            "what's that?"

                               morpheus

 "a concentric ring of defenses that shields zion. the fighters that
              just saved us constitute the first ring."

                             niobe (v.o.)

                    "neb crew, you can relax now."

                               morpheus

       "for the moment, perhaps. its still a long drive home."

                                                              fade out

and

fade into:

trinity's  cabin.  at  first  we  see  only  stars  twinkling, faraway
diamonds on a black velvet background. the camera descends through the
darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. the artwork
terminates in the metal ring going  around her room. it's a much  more
hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. the  articles
she's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. an
unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. there are charcoal portraits  of
loved ones.

softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. the neb is still in tow. neo  is
sitting against the wall on trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him
with her head on his lap.

neo can’t sleep. he stares at the wall opposite him. there's a   photo
of the crew of the neb, sans trin, in better days. smiling,   laughing
as they are  seated around the  table. morpeus, tank,  dozer,  switch,
epoch, mouse. neo stops on the image of a smiling cypher. there's   an
unknown asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely.

gently,  placing  trinity's head  down,  neo stands  and  examines the
photo.

                             she awakens.

                               trinity

           "i'll have to take that one down now. cypher..."

                                 neo

                          "who is this guy?"

                               trinity

                                "who?"

                    neo points to the mystery man.

                               trinity

                  "that was... i... forgot his name."

                                 neo

                       "what happened to him?"

                          trinity is sullen.

                         "he didn’t make it."

  neo returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed. trinity sits up,
                              awakening.

                                 neo

                          "was he like me?"

                            trinity nods.

                               trinity

      "not you, though. like you. there have been others, neo."

                         "aren't you tired?"

                                 neo

                 "no. i've never been a big sleeper."

                               trinity

   "i know. i used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days."

               he turns to her, questions in his eyes.

                                 neo

                  "how many 'ones' have there been?"

                               trinity

                       "that's not the point."

                        neo may not think so.



                               trinity

                     "you are him. you’re mine."

                                 neo

               "but what does it mean, to be the one?"

                               trinity

          "i don't know, neo. our mission was to find you."

                                 neo

                           "so, now what?"

                               trinity

               "now, zion will give us a new mission."

              the hatch swings open. morpheus peers in.

                               morpheus

       "we're almost home. we'll need a detail. five minutes."

                 he closes the hatch and disappears.

                                 neo

                        "does he ever knock?"

                               trinity

                          "not on his ship."

                                                               cut to:

int. main deck, neb

the crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes  to
a rest. outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. tank   unlocks
