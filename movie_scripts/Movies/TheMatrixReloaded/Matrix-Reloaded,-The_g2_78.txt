ext. burnt-out cathedral (matrix) - night

                  neo’s relief fades into confusion.

                                 neo

                         "i know. i’m sorry."

                           morpheus (o.s.)

                        "and the problem is..."

                                 neo

 "uh, it’s impossible. if the matrix is destroyed, the people within
the system will die. they will all die. there has to be a different
                                way."

                      morpheus doesn’t respond.

                                 neo

                    "morpheus? did you know this?"

we  hear  nothing. neo  can  hear his  own  heart beating.  anger  and
confusion add to the already heavy mental burden he carries.



                           morpheus (o.s.)

              "i didn’t say things would be easy, neo."

        neo sinks to the ground, shocked. he shakes his head.

                                 neo

                                "no."
