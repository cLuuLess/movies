int. main deck (night)

razor clears the  screen in front  of him and  cracks his fingers.  he
looks at circa.

                                circa

                            "they’re ok?"

                                razor

           "gotta get ‘em out. they need an exit program."

cu: keyboard.  razor’s fingers  fly at  inhuman speeds  over the keys.
data  pours down  the console  as he  blazes away.  finally, he  hits
‘enter’ so hard it rocks the station.

razor  turns to  circa as  matrix code  resumes its  cascade down  the
screens.

                                razor

                      "yes! did you like that?"

                      circa just rolls her eyes.

            morpheus’ phone rings. he answers. it’s razor.

                                razor

                          "exit ready sir."

                               morpheus

                     "check the phone for bombs."
