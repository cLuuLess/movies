ext. street (matrix) - day

                                woman

   "no. fuck you, choi, you just think you can come and go when you
                               please?"

choi is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as  she
is having a fit. tears are welling in her enraged face.

"choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - "

inexplicably, choi  hangs his  trench coat  on the  side of the booth.
standing behind it, he reaches  around with his arm, keeping  the coat
between his body and the phone. the woman doesn’t even notice the  web
of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering  the
inside of the jacket.

                                woman

  " - you’ll tell me why you don’t call, why you, you, what are you
                               doing?"

                                 choi

"the jacket stops fragmentation. sometimes they bomb the phones. kiss
                            me for luck."

he grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers.

cu: phone

his hand grabs the phone. we hear the dialtone, and he mashes down one
of the  numbers of  the keypad.  the number  tone rises  in pitch to a
crescendo. we pull back and:

the booth explodes. choi and the woman are bowled over by the flame.
