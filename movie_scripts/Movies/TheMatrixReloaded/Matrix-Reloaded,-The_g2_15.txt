the glass windshield explodes and  their seats slide forward into  the
console, smashing them like jelly.


cu: gregory and chandra

with  his  hand  still  on  the  grille,  chandra  and  gregory remain
untouched, even as the entire police cruiser rips around them. we drop
back into real  time and see  the cruiser’s body  rip over and  around
them. the grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission
remain still against  gregory’s hand. the  cruiser was gutted,  like a
banana shot down the center from top to bottom. it speeds beyond them,
silent now, flips and explodes.

the engine block is suspended a few  feet in the air. it drops to  the
ground with a thud.

gregory and chandra get to their  feet and run into the early  morning
desert.


cu: gutted cruiser

unbelievably, the driver is still alive... barely. the steering  wheel
is smashed deep  into his mouth,  splitting his jaw  open. wet, broken
chokes emanate from his blood-filled mouth. his eyes flicker, and just
before they close forever, his body is seized by pain as he morphs.


ext. gutted cruiser

the crumpled door is knocked out  of the frame. we see a  black loafer
step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps  out
slowly.

we rise  up from  the loafer.  as the  other cruisers  catch up to the
scene of the accident, agent brown watches. he looks into the desert.

                a police lieutenant approaches brown.

                              lieutenant

                       "sir, should we pursue?"

                             agent brown

 "withdraw your men and pursue the others. we have our own plans for
                              this one."
