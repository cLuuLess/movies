with one hand on the frame. it comes crashing down and back into  real
time.


the  bike’s body  streaks along  the highway.  the sparks  fade as  it
slows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them.
they  stop,  crouching  atop the  body,  with  gregory crouching  over
chandra. the disembodied front wheel rolls past them.

stunned,  not quite  understanding how  or what  he just  did, he  and
chandra stand and start running. behind  them is a blurry wall of  red
and blue lights. police sirens grow louder.

they start running down the  highway, then gregory yanks chandra  to a
stop.

                               gregory

                   "split up, into the desert, go!"

                             they split.

cu on chandra. in bare feet, she sprints for the side of the road. the
highway is  littered with  pieces of  the bike,  and she  stomps on  a
twisted piece of metal  that impales her bare  foot. she falls to  the
asphalt with a scream.

gregory turns  and rushes  back to  her, even  as a  police cruiser is
bearing down on them, it’s v-8 roaring and the siren impossibly loud.
