ext. street (matrix) - day

the phone booth is obliterated.  miraculously, choi and the woman  are
still under the cover of  the jacket. throwing the smoking  jacket off
them, choi screams in agony as  he grasps the smoldering stump of  his
right shoulder. the arm is history.

the woman looks on,  her eyes as wide  as dinner plates. shaking,  she
falls back, still staring.

                                 choi

                         "you weren’t lucky."

morpheus, niobe, and trinity rush to him, picking him up on his  feet.
choi is  screaming and  laughing. someone  grabs his  smoldering coat,
dragging it along. choi stares at the ex-flame as they cart him  away.
his eyes are crazy.

                                 choi

              "you still want me to call you? ha ha ha!"

as they struggle down the street, choi starts to walk more on his own.
people run from the scene, screaming.

                        cu - the four of them.

morphues looks  at something  off-screen and  frowns. he  pulls to the
left.

                               morpheus

                             "this way."
