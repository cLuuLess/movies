frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest. gandalf,
suspicious, alert. without a word, gandalf takes the envelope
and tosses it into the fireplace!

                    frodo
              (bewildered)
          what are you doing?

flames instantly consume the envelope...revealing the ring,
as it sinks into the red hot embers. gandalf reaches into the
fire with a pair of tongs...he lifts the ring out.

                    gandalf
          hold out your hand, frodo...it is quite
          cool.

gandalf drops the ring into frodo's hand...he reacts to its
weight.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          what can you see? can you see anything?

                    frodo
          nothing...there's nothing.   wait...

                                                    (continued)

close on: the gold band of the ring as fiery letters begin to
appear...a tiny inscription glows red...as if burning from
within.

                    gandalf
          ...these are markings.

close on: gandalf...still...tense

                    fro do
          it's some form of elvish...i can't read
          it.

                    gandalf
              (ominous)
          there are few who can...the language is
          that of mordor, which i will not utter
          here.

mordor?

                    frodo
          gandalf

in the common tongue it says, "one ring to rule them all, one
ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the
darkness bind them."
