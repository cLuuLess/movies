int. orthanc ante-chamber -- night

saruman stands over the palantir, his hands cupping the
massive eye.

                    saruman
              (whisper)
          the power of isengard is at your command,
          sauron, lord of the earth.

on the soundtrack: black speech fills the room...admist the

harsh, guttural words the voice of saruman emerges.

                    saruman
          build me an army worth of mordor.
