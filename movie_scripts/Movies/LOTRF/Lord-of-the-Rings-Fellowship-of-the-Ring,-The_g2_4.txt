ext. hobbiton fields -- day

wide on: the cart rattles past a field lupin being tended by

hobbits.

                     frodo
           what news of the outside world? tell me
           everything!

                                                       angle on:

gandalf looks down at frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     gandalf
           what, everything? far too eager and
           curious for a hobbit. most unnatural...

wide on: the cart rattles over a stone bridge towards a busy
hobbit marketplace.

                      gandalf (v.o.) (cont'd)
           well, what can i tell you? life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           hobbits...

close on: gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     gandalf (cont'd)
           ...for which i am very thankful.

                                                       angle on:

hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing gandalf and frodo rolls past the green dragon
inn...towards... wide on: the party field. where scorcs of
hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     gandalf (cont'd)
           ah, the long expected party. so, how is
           the old rascal? i hear it's going to be
           a party of special magnificence.

                     frodo
           you know bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

                     gandalf
           oh, well...that should please him.


                                                     (continued)

continued:


                    frodo
          half the shire's been invited...

                    gandalf
          good gracious, me.

                    frodo
          he's up to something.

                    gandalf
          oh, really?

frodo shoots a knowing look, as gandalf averts his eyes.

                    frodo
          alright then..keep your secrets. before
          you came along we bagginses were very
          well thought of.

                       gandalf
          indeed?

                    frodo
          never had any adventures or did anything
          unexpected.

                    gandalf
          if you're referring to the incident with
          the dragon...i was barely involved...all
          i did was give your uncle a little nudge
          out the door.

                    frodo
          whatever you did...you've been officially
          labelled as a disturber of the peace.

                    gandalf
          oh, really?

                                                       angle on:

odo proudfoot looks up as the cart passes by, deeply
suspicious.
