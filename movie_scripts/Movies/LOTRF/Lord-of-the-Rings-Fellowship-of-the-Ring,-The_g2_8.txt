int. bag end -- evening

gandalf and bilbo are sitting on the bag end porch. below
them, final preparations are being made on the party field.
bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe.

                    bilbo
          old toby, the finest weed in
          southfarthing!

bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the
air. a tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through
the center of bilbo's smoke ring.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          ohhhh,
              (smiles)
          gandalf my old friend...this will be a
          night to remember!
