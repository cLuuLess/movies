ext. emyn muil hilltop -- day

frodo and sam scramble onto a high ridge.

a distant line of saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....mordor!




                                                    (continued)

continued:


                     frodo
          mordor!   i hope the others find a safer
          road.

                    sam
              (simply)
          strider'll look after them.

                    frodo
          i don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

                    sam
          we may yet, mr. frodo.   we may.

                     frodo
          sam?

frodo looks at sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, sam is undeterred...

                    frodo (cont'd)
          i'm glad you're with me.

wide on: the two hobbits setting off toward mordor.

THE END
