ext. hobbiton woods -- day

angle on: two hobbit feet

resting on a small rock...rising out of the long, overgrown
grasses super: the fellowship of the ring super: the
shire....60 years later camera tracks to: a figure lies
beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree.

                                                      (continued)

continued:

white flowers are scattered among the well seeded grasses.
an idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the
figure is reading a book. on the soundtrack: in the distance,
growing louder..over the gentle clip clop of an approaching
cart and horse can be heard the humming of a deep voice to
the tune of "the road goes ever on and on..."

suddenly! the figure in the grass sits up...looking straight
at camera is a handsome young hobbit, with dark curly hair
and deep blue eyes. this is frodo baggins...his eyes alight
with excitement! tossing away the long stem of grass in his
mouth, frodo runs off.
