int. frodo's bedroom--rivendell

frodo raises himself up and looks at gandalf.

                    frodo
          gandalf! what is it? gandalf returns his
          attention to frodo.

                    gandalf
          nothing, frodo...

sam runs to frodo's bedside.   he is overjoyed to find frodo
awake.

                     sam
          frodo!   frodo!   bless you, you're awake!!

                    gandalf
          sam has hardly left your side.

                    sam
          we were worried about you--weren't we,
          mr. gandalf?

                    gandalf
          by the skills of lord elrond, you're
          beginning to mend. elrond, lord of the
          high elves, steps up to frodo's

bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is
written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.

                    elrond
          welcome to rivendell, frodo baggins.
          frodo sits up, looking at elrond with
          awe.
