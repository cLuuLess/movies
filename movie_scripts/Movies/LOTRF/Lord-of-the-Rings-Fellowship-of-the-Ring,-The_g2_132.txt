ext. silverlode river bank--dawn

the fellowship are in small elven boats. they row away from
the lothlorien shore into the silverlode river. elves
quietly watch them depart. galadriel gives frodo a small
crystal phial.

                    galadriel
          farewell, frodo baggins. i give you the
          light of earendil, our most beloved star.

                                                 (continued)

continued:


as the fellowship's boats drift past, galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. in his head, frodo
still hears her voice...

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          may it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.
