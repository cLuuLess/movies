ext. bag end -- night

                                                      angle on:

bilbo staggering out of bag end...he braces himself in the
night air, pale and trembling, as if his loss of the ring has
weakened him. gandalf steps up behind.

                    bilbo
          i've thought up and ending for my
          book..."and he lived happily ever after
          to the end of his days."

                    gandalf
          i'm sure you will, my dear friend.

                    bilbo
          goodbye, gandalf.

                    gandalf
          goodbye bilbo.
