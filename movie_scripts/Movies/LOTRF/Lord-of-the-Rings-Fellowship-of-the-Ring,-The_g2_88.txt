ext. rivendell terrace -- day

close on: bilbo baggins! he breaks in to a broad grin as
frodo rushes forward to embrace him. bilbo has aged
significantly since we last saw him.

                    bilbo
          hello, frodo, my lad!

                     frodo
          bilbo!

later... frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of
a red leather bound journal:

                    frodo (cont'd)
              (reading)
          "there and back again: a hobbit's tale"
          by bilbo baggins.

bilbo smiles proudly. he is sitting with frodo on a terrace
overlooking a waterfall. frodo looks at page after page of
beautiful handwriting, with intricate maps and drawings.



                                                    (continued)

continued:


                    frodo (cont'd)
          this is wonderful.

                    bilbo
          i meant to go back...wander the paths of
          mirkwood, visit laketown, see the lonely
          mountain again...but age, it seems, has
          finally caught up with me.

frodo turns a page...there before him, is a map of the shire.

                    frodo
              (quietly)
          i miss the shire...i spent all my
          childhood pretending i was off somewhere
          else...off with you, on one of your
          adventures...
              (looks at bilbo)
          but my own adventure, turned out to be
          quite different...i'm not like you,
          bilbo.

                    bilbo
          my dear boy...
