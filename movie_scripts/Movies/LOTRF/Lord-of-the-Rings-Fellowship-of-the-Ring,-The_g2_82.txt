int. frodo's bedroom -- day

frodo's eyes flicker open he is lying in bed next to an open
window...dappled sunlight plays on richly carved
timbers...the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the
vista of fir trees.

                    frodo
              (weak relief)
          gandalf!




angle on: gandalf is sitting next to frodo's bed...

softly puffing on his pipe.    he smiles at frodo.

                    gandalf
          yes, i'm here and you're lucky to be
          here, too. a few more hours and you
          would have been beyond our aid. you have
          some strength in you, my dear hobbit.

frodo sits up, looking at gandalf questioningly...

                    frodo
          what happened, gandalf?    why didn't you
          meet us?

                    gandalf
          i'm sorry frodo.

close on: gandalf... troubled.   his eyes drift away.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          i was delayed.
