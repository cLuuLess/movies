int. prancing pony inn -- night

wide on: the noise, smokey inn. it is dimly lit, cheifly
from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of big
folk, local hobbits, and a couple of dwarfs. frodo, sam,
merry and pippin are sitting at a table against the wall...
clearly trying to remain quiet and inconspicuous... sam can't
help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around.

                                                    (continued)

continued:


                    frodo
          sam, he'll be here.    he'll come.

merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large
mug of beer.

                    pippin
          what's that?

                    merry
          this, my friend, is a pint.

                    pippin
          it comes in pints?    i'm getting one!

sam watches pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to
the bar.

                    sam
          you've had a whole half already. merry
          watches pippin go.

a couple of swarthy men leaning against the bar glance at
frodo, then quickly look away.

                    sam (cont'd)
              (tense)
          that fellow's done nothing but stare at
          you since we've arrived.

sam indicates a brooding stranger who sits alone at a table
in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed
pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with
gleaming eyes. frodo gestures to butterbur...

                    frodo
          excuse me, that man in the corner, who is
          he?

                    butterbur
          he's one of them rangers; they're
          dangerous folk they are, wandering the
          wilds. what his right name is, i never
          heard, but round here he's known as
          strider.

                    frodo
              (to himself)
          strider.

beneath table: frodo's fingers are nervously toying with the
ring.




close on: frodo

sweat runs down his brow.   the strange hum of the ring spills
into the soundtrack.

"baggins...baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill frodo's
head...sound that dissolves into pippin's loud voice:

                    pippin
          baggins? sure, i know a baggins...he's
          over there...

angle on: pippin

sitting at the bar, chatting with locals.   frodo leaps to his
feet and pushes his way towards the bar.

                    pippin
              (loudly)
          frodo baggins. he's my second cousin
          once removed, on his mother's side and my
          third cousin twice removed on his
          father's side...if you follow me.

frodo grabs pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer.

                    frodo
          pippin!

                    pippin
          steady on, frodo!

pippin pushes frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls
to the floor. at that instant, the inn goes silent and all
the attention turns to frodo...

                                                      close on:

the ring...in agonizing slow motion we watch as it seems to
hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto
his out stretched finger. frodo vanishes! there is a sharp
intake of breath...followed by total silence.

                                                        cut to:
