the jagged ruins of" barad-dur. the dark tower! teasing
images: the huge dark tower of barad-dur is being rebuilt!
thousands of orcs crawl over the surface, hauling stone and
iron up the towering heights.

wide on: mount doom...a huge, billowing cloud of black filth

grows and spreads across the red streaked sky...casting a
shadowy pall over the nightmarish landscape.
