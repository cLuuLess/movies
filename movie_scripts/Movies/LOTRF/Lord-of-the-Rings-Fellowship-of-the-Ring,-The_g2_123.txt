ext. lothlorien hilltop -- day

haldir leads the fellowship onto a hill top.   they look with
wonderment at the vista spread before them.

several miles towards the south, a large hill rises out of
the woods. upon the hill rise many mighty mallorn trees,
taller than any others...nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a beautiful city. it gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. to the east
of caras galadhon, the woods of lorien run down the pale
gleam of anduin, the great river. beyond the river, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. the sun that lies
on lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie
beyond.
