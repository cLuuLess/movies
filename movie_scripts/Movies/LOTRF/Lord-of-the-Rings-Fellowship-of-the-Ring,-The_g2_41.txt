int. orthanc ante-chamber -- day

saruman and gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to
the side of the cavernous central chamber.

                                                    (continued)

continued:


                    saruman
          sauron has regained much of his former
          strength. he cannot yet take physical
          form...but his spirit has lost none of
          its potency. concealed within his
          fortress, the lord of mordor sees all.
          his gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth,
          and flesh. you know of what i speak,
          gandalf...a great eye, lidless, wreathed
          in flame.

                    gandalf
              (softly)
          the eye of sauron.

                    saruman
          he is gathering all evil to him.

                    saruman (cont'd)
          very soon he will have summoned an army
          great enough to launch an assault upon
          middle earth.

                    gandalf
          you know this? how?

                    saruman
          i have seen it.

gandalf and saruman stride through orthanc toward a stone
plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...

                    gandalf
          a palantir is a dangerous tool, saruman.

saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the palantir.

                     saruman
          why?   why should we fear to use it?

                    gandalf
          they are not all accounted for, the lost
          seeing-stones...we do not know who else
          may be watching. gandalf throws the cloth
          back over the palantir.

flash image: a fiery eye!

saruman sits upon his throne.




                                                    (continued)

continued:


                    saruman
          the hour is later than you think.
          sauron's forces are already moving...the
          nine have left minas morgul.

                    gandalf
              (shocked)
          the nine!

                    saruman
          they crossed the river isen in
          midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
          black.

                    gandalf
              (alarmed)
          they have reached the shire? saruman
          shrugs...

                    saruman
          they will find the ring...and kill the
          one who carries it.

gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified
as the doors suddenly slam shut.

                    saruman (cont'd)
          you did not seriously think a hobbit
          could contend with the will of sauron?
          there are none who can.

gandalf slowly turns to saruman...a look of dawning horror.

                    saruman (cont'd)
          against the power of mordor, there can be
          no victory. we must join with him,
          gandalf. we must join with sauron. it
          would be wise, my friend.

                    gandalf
              (deadly)
          tell me, friend, when did saruman the
          wise abandon reason for madness?

at that moment: gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
he slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. with sudden effort, gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on saruman...blasting him off his
feet! gandalf and saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing
them across the room. saruman screams, eyes blazing!
gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into saruman's hand! gandalf is
flung to the floor.

                                                    (continued)

continued: (2)


                    saruman
          i gave you the chance of aiding me
          willingly, but you have elected the way
          of pain.

gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into
the madness of saruman... commanding two staffs, saruman
sends gandalf into a sickening spin. gandalf tumbles towards
the top of the chamber...as if falling in reverse. rushing
pov: the roof of orthanc rockets toward camera.
