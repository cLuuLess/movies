            i will, be waiting for you at the inn of
            the prancing pony. frodo packs his food
            into his knapsack.

            and the ring will be safe there?

                      gandalf
            i don't know, frodo. i don't have any
            answers. i must see the head of my
            order. he is both wise and powerful.
            trust me, frodo. he'll know what to go.
