the cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, frodo
shivers... and the door stands fast!

                                                         later:

gandalf continues...

mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. sam packs
pots and pans at his feet...watching sadly as aragorn un-
saddles bill the pony. close on: aragorn whispering to bill
the pony.

                    aragorn
              (whispering)
          mines are no place for a pony, even one
          so brave as bill.

                       sam
          bye, bill.

                    aragorn
          go on, bill, go on..don't worry, sam...he
          knows his way home. aragorn slaps bill on
          the rump...bill goes trotting off. close
          on: sam watching bill disappear into the
          darkness.

                    sam
          goodbye, bill.

splash! merry and pippin are tossing stones into the lake.
black rippling rings slowly fan out. pippin is about to
throw another stone, but aragorn grabs his arm.


                                                    (continued)

continued:


                    aragorn
              (ominous)
          do not disturb the water.

aragorn watches anxiously as the ripples appear to grow....he
exchanges a look with boromir.

aragorn's hand creeps towards his sword. gandalf gives up in
despair...he sits down beside frodo. close on: frodo peers at
the elvish inscription...his face breaks into a smile of
comprehension.

                    frodo
              (quietly)
          it's a riddle...

gandalf raises his eyebrows...

                    frodo (cont'd)
              (explaining)
          speak, friend, and enter.   what's the
          elvish for friend?

                    gandalf
          oh...mellon.

with that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and
two great doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness
deeper than the night. as the fellowship enter the blackness,
something in the water stirs....
