int. "prancing pony" reception -- night

frodo, sam, merry and pippin come rushing in.   frodo attracts
the inn keepers's attention.

                       frodo
          excuse me.

                     butterbur
          good evening, little masters. if you're
          seeking accommodation, we've got some
          nice, cozy hobbit sized rooms available,
          mr...ah...

                    frodo
          underhill...my name's underbill.

                       butterbur
          underhill?     hmmmm.

                    frodo
          we're friends of gandalf the grey...can
          you tell him we've arrived? butterbur
          frowns...

                    butterbur
              (puzzled)
          gandalf...gandalf...oh...
              (recognition)
          oh yes! i remember...elderly chap...big
          grey beard...pointy hat? frodo nods with
          relief...butterbur shakes his head.

                    butterbur (cont'd)
          not seen him for six months. frodo is
          shocked.

                    sam
              (worried whisper)
          what do we do now?
