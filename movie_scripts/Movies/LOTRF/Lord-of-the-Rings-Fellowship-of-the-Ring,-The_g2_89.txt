ext. rivendell terrace -- evening

sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his
already full pack...pots and pans, blankets, cooking
utensils, provisions, clothes.

                    sam
          no, what have i forgotten? pull back to
          reveal frodo, hands in his pocket,
          watching sam.

                    frodo
          packed already?

sam looks up, startled.

                    sam
              (slightly embarrassed)
          no harm in being prepared. frodo strolls
          to the edge of the balcony.

                    frodo
          i thought you wanted to see the elves,
          sam?



                                                    (continued)

                    sam
          i do...

                    frodo
          more than anything.

                    sam
          i did. it's just...we did what gandalf
          wanted, didn't we? we got the ring this
          far, to rivendell...and i thought...
          seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be
          off soon. off home.

                    frodo
          you're right, sam. frodo looks at sam...

                    frodo (cont'd)
          ...we did what we set out to do. frodo
          opens his hand, the ring sits in his
          palm.

                    frodo (cont'd)
          the ring will be safe in rivendell. i am
          ready to go home.
