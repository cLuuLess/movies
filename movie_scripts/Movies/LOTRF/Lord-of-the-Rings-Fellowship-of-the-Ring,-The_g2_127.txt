glossy surface. the night sky is reflected into     the water...
suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure     of an old
man, clad in white robes. he walks down a long      road. frodo
leans closer to the mirror's surface...




close on: gandalf lifts his head and looks directly at frodo!

frodo gasps, his face lighting up with hope.

                    frodo
              (joyous)
          gandalf!

gandalf looks at frodo with a fierce intensity. frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.
suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. the vision
shifts...frodo gasps in horror! the shire is in ruins! the
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...dark shapes of orcs looting
and destroying...bag end, billowing in flames! the party
tree is hacked down. frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.

image: hobbiton...now an industrial wasteland! the fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with brick factories belching
smoke! image: orcs brutally herd manacled hobbits into the
factories! we see sam...merry... and rosie cotton. soot-
