ext. slopes of amon hen -- day

frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. his
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of amon hen...the seeing seat. a crackling sound!
frodo freezes....

                    boromir
              (quietly)
          none of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. so much depends on you...frodo?

frodo turns slowly...he stares at boromir, tense, cautious.

                    boromir (cont'd)
          i know why you seek solitude. you
          suffer, i see it day by day. are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of rauros can be
heard

                    boromir (cont'd)
          let me help you. there are other ways,
          frodo..other paths that we might take.

                    frodo
          i know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.

                     boromir
          warning?   against what?

boromir has started forward towards frodo, he pulls himself
up.




                                                    (continued)

continued:


                    boromir (cont'd)
          we are all afraid, frodo. but to let that
          fear drive us to destroy what hope we
          have...don't you see that is madness?

                    frodo
          there is no other way.

                    boromir
          i ask only for the strength to defend my
          people.
              (angrily drops the wood he has
               collected)
          if you would but lend me the ring...

                    frodo
          no. . .

frodo steps hurriedly away from boromir.

                    boromir
          why do you recoil?   i am no thief.

                     frodo
              (wary)
          you are not yourself.

                    boromir
          what chance do you think you have? they
          will find you, they will take the ring
          and you will beg for death before the
          end.

frodo turns to leave.

                    boromir (cont'd)
          you fool! it is not yours save by
          unhappy chance...it might have been mine.
          it should be mine. give it to me! give
          me the ring.

boromir leaps on top of frodo, grasping for the ring! frodo
has only moments to act. frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

                    frodo disappears
          boromir spins wildly around, yelling into
          thin air!

                    boromir
          i see your mind...you will take the ring
          to sauron. you will betray us! you go to
          your death and the death of us all.
                    (more)
                                                  (continued)

continued: (2)
                      boromir (cont'd)
            curse you! curse you and your halflings!
            boromir stumbles and falls. his body
            shakes as if in the throes of a
            fit...slowly he comes to.

                      boromir (cont'd)
                (disoriented)
            frodo! frodo! what have i done. please,
            frodo...
