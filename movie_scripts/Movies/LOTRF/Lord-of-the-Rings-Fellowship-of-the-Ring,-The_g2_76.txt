frodo is breathing hard, desperately ill. frodo's half-
conscious pov: surreal impression...a shimmering figure in
white leaps off a horse.

flash insert: an ethereal vision of arwen, as she appears on
the other side...

                      arwen
                (elvish: with sub titles)
            frodo, im arwen...telin let thaed. i am
            arwen, i have come here to help you.
                (urgent)
            lasto beth nin, tolo dan na ngalad. hear
            my voice, come back to the light. frodo's
            eyes close.

                      pippin
            who is she?

                      arwen
                (worried)
            frodo?

                      sam
            she's an elf.




angle on: arwen

who now appears in her earth bound form, a young elven woman
with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes.

                    arwen
          he's fading...he's not gong to last. we
          must get him to my father. strider
          quickly lifts frodo...placing him on the
          horse.

                    arwen (cont'd)
          i have been looking for you for two days.

                    pippin
          where are you taking him?

                    arwen
          there are five wraiths behind you, where
          the other four are, i do not know.

                    strider
              (elvish: with subtitles)
          dartho guin berian...rych le ad
          tolthathon. stay with the hobbits...i'11
          send horses for you. close on: arwen
          grabbing the reins of the horse.

                    arwen
              (elvish: w/subtitles)
          hon mabathon. rochoh ellint im. i'll
          take him. i'm the faster rider. strider
          clamps his hand over arwen's.

                    strider
              (elvish:subtitles)
          andelu i ven. the road is too dangerous.

                    arwen
              (elvish: subtitles)
          frodo fir. ae anthradon i hir, tur
          gwaith nin beriatha hon. if i can cross
          the river, the power of my people can
          protect him.

                    pippin
          what are they saying?

close on: arwen reaches for strider's hand...looking deep
into his eyes.

                    arwen
          i do not fear them.

                                                 (continued)

continued:


close on: strider...we see that it is hard for him to let her
go.

                                                     angle on:

arwen mounts her horse, alsforth...

                    strider
          arwen...ride hard, don't look back.

                                                     angle on:

arwen looks down at strider as she supports frodo with one
hand.

                    arwen
              (elvish)
          noro lim, asfaloth, noro lim!

                    sam
          what are you doing!    those wraiths are
          still out there!

                                                     angle on:

asfaloth springs away, bearing arwen and frodo into the
night.
