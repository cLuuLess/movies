int. tower of cirith ungol/top room - night

angle on: frodo struggling against his bonds, as gorbag
climbs back into the room ... with vengeance in his evil
eyes.

                      gorbag
           stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!

close on: gorbag grabs frodo's hair and pulls his head back,
exposing his neck. he pulls out his sword, ready to cut
frodo's throat . . .

                      gorbag (cont'd)
           i'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!

suddenly! gorbag gasps as sting is rammed into his back by
sam!

                      sam
           not if i stick you first!

gorbag falls dead!

                      frodo
                (joyous disbelief)
           sam!!!

angle on: frodo . . . humbled by sam's unswerving loyalty.

                       frodo (cont'd)
           oh, sam . . . i'm so sorry . . . sorry for
           everything.

sam quickly cuts frodo free.

                      sam
           come on.

                      frodo
                (despairing)
           it's too late. it's over . . . they've taken
           it. sam - they took the ring!!

                         sam
                  (quietly)
             begging your pardon, but they haven't.

sam pulls the ring from his pocket ...

                         sam (cont'd)
             i thought i ' d lost you . . . so i took it -
             only for safe-keeping.

close on: frodo looks at sam amazed . . . his eyes drop to the
rn ...
 ig

                        frodo
             give it to me.

sam hesitates . . . . tension instantly builds between them.

                        frodo (cont'd)
             give me the ring, sam.

sam seems strangely reluctant . . . on the soundtrack to hum of
the ring builds

                        frodo (cont'd)
             sam! give me the ring.

close on: sam drops the ring into frodo's palm . . .

frodo sags in relief . . . he puts the ring back around his
nc . ..
 ek

                         frodo (cont'd)
             you must understand . . . the ring is my
             burden . . . it will destroy you, sam.

frodo looks at sam, pain in his eyes ...

sam looks down at frodo ... his plain hobbit face full of
compassion. sam's resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold.

                      sam
           come on, mr frodo, we'd best find you some
           clothes . . . you can't go walking through
           mordor in naught but your skin.
