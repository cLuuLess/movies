angle on: frodo and sam lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a
stagnant pool. smeagol lies nearby, muttering in his sleep.

                     smeagol
          too risky, too risky. the thieves! they
          stole it from us. kill them . . . kill them
          ... kill them both!

smeagol wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in sweat,
eyes wide in horror.

                     sme ago l (c ont' d)
          no!

                  (hissed whisper)
             shhh! quiet!

smeagol's features suddenly transform into the malevolent
face of gollum!

                        gollum (cont'd)
             mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

smeagol casts a quick glance over his shoulder to the
sleeping figures of frodo and sam as he clambers off his rock
. . . silently sidling towards the edge of a stagnant pool.

                        smeagol
             they knows, they knows, they suspects us.



smeagol stares into the murky depths of the water.

the surface ripples as the face of gollum appears as smeagol's
reflection.

             what is it saying,.my precious, my love? is .
             smeagol losing his nerve??

                        smeagol                 :
             no! not! never!! smeagol hates nasty
             hobbitses! smeagol wants to see: them -
             dead!

                         gollum
             and we will . . ,- smeagol did it once. . .
                  (sly)
             . . . he can do it again.

flash insert: smeagol choking deagol . . . fingers locked tight
around his throat.

                        gollum (cont'd)
             it's ours - ours!

                      smeagol
           we must get the precious. we must get it
           back.

                      gollum
           patience, patience, my love. first we must
           lead them to her.

                      smeagol
           we lead them to the windy stairs.

                      gollum
                (prompting)
           yes, the stairs ... and then?

                        smeagol
           up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until
           we come to . . .
                 (naughty excitement)
           ... the tunnel!

                      gollum
                (quiet)
           and when they go in, there's no coming out.
           she's always hungry, she always needs to
           feed. she must eat, all she gets is filthy
           orcses.

                      smeagol
           and they doesn't taste very nice, does
           they, precious?               .

                      gollum
                (sinister)
           no . . . not very nice at all, my love. she
           hungers for sweeter meats . . .

close on: sam . . . his eyes flicker open . . .

                         gollum (cont'd)
           "hobbit meat." and when she throws away the
           bones and the empty clothes, then we will
           find it . . .

                      smeagol
           and take it for me!

          yes, we, we meant for us . . .

          go hum! go hum!

                     gollum
               (sly)
          the precious will be ours once the
          hobbitses are dead!

sudden angle on: sam image mirrored in the water as he smacks
gollum on the head with his pot!

               (yelling)            ,·     .
          you treacherous little toad!

sam drops the pot and flings himself on top of gollum! gollum
screams . . . his arms and legs flailing wildly!

                     gollum
               (crying)
          no! not! help! master!

angle on: frodo staggers over to sam and pulls him off
gollum.

                    frodo
          no, sam! leave him alone!

close on: gollum, huddled on the ground        whimpering and
sobbing.

                      sam
               (fuming)
          i heard it from his own mouth        he means

                       smeagol
            never! smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
            he's a horrid, fat hobbit who hates smeagol
            and who makes up nasty lies!

sam makes for smeagol again . . . with a look of murderous
rage.

                       sam
            you miserable little maggot! i'll stove
            your head in!

frodo grabs sam's arm.

                       frodo
            sam! if you scare him off, we're lost.

sam pulls away from frodo . . .

                       sam
            i don't care! i can't do it, mr frodo. i
            won' t wait around for him to kill us !

                       frodo
                 (fierce whisper)
            i'm not sending him away.

sam stares at frodo . . . at a loss.

                       sam
            you don't see it, do you? he's a villain!

                       frodo
                 (lowers voice)
            we can't do this by ourselves, sam. not
            without a guide. i need you on my side.

angle on: sam, his face softening.

                      sam
                (taken aback)
           i'm on your side, mr frodo.

                       frodo
           i know, sam, i know.
                (whisper)
           you must trust me.

frodo beckons to gollum.

                      frodo (cont'd)
           come, smeagol.

gollum turns slowly, staring at sam through hooded, hate-filled
eyes ... and smiles.
