ext. the sixth gate, minas tirith - dawn

wide on: a rabble of orcs are clustered outside the sixth
gate as trolls pound on its wooden doors with huge hammers.

angle on: wood splinters . . . the doors are near breaking
point.

angle on: gandalf and pippin sit on stone steps . . . both
covered in sweat and grime, bone-weary from fighting, spirits
and hearts bruised . . .

pippin looks towards the wooden gates at which a number of
soldiers continue to build a barricade . . .

                         pippin
                  (quiet)
             i didn't think it would end this way . . .

gandalf looks at the small hobbit a beat.

                         gandalf
                  (gently)
             end? no, the journey doesn't end here.


                                                          (continued)

continued:


pippin looks up at gandalf, questioningly . . . .

                        gandalf (cont'd)
             death is just another path, one that we all
             must take.

angle on: gandalf looks down to see pippin looking up at him
with fear in his eyes . . .

                         gandalf (cont'd)
                  (remembering)
             the grey rain curtain of this world rolls
             back and all turns to silver glass . . .
                  (to himself)
             and then you see it . . .

angle on: gandalf breaks off, lost in reverie . . .

                        pippin
             what, gandalf? see what?

                        gandalf
             white shores ... and beyond . . . a far green
             country under a swift sunrise.

pippin stares up at the old wizard's face, softened, quiet
and full of peace . . .

                         pippin
                  (quiet)
             well, that isn't so bad.

                        gandalf
                  (gently)
             no . . . no, it isn't.

boom!

angle on: gandalf and pippin's faces turn as the wooden doors
shudder under another blow.

                                                             cut to:
