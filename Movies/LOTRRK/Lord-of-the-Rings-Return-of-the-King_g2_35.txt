angle on: following the stairs . . . higher and higher up the
sheer western side of the morgul valley - to the high peaks
of the razor-like mountains of mordor.

                         gollum (cont'd)
             the secret stairs . . . climb!

suddenly! frodo staggers across the road . . . as if some
force, other than his own will, is at work! he lurches

                        frodo
                  (disorientated)
             they're calling me!

frodo falls to the ground.

at that moment: the ground quivers, and a great rumbling
noise rolls across the ground and echoes in the mountains.

the cold, dull morgul valley is suddenly violent and fierce,
as uprushing flame springs from mount doom.

minas morgul answers: a flare of livid lightning, forks of
blue flame, spring up from the tower into the sullen cloud.
