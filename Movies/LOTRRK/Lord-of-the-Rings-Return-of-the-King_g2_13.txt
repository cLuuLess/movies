int. edoras, sleeping quarters - early dawn,

close on: pippin . . . he is awake! he sits up . . . anxious,
fidgety . . .

suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the sleeping form
of gandalf.

                      merry
           (whispers)
           what you doing?
                                                       (continued)

                                        final revision - october, 2003 16,
continued:


pippin gasps with fright! merry is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. he moves on . . .

angle on: a sleeping gandalf lies with eyes wide open! but
pippin is undeterred . . .

merry sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       merry (cont'd)
             pippin? pippin? pippin! what are you doing?

with quick stealth, pippin lifts the wrapped palantir from
gandalf's grasp ...

                       merry (cont'd)
             pippin, are you mad?

                        pippin
             i just want to look at it. just one more
             time.

                       merry
             put it back! put - it - back!

pippin unwraps the palantir and as merry looks on horrified,
he gazes intently into it.

                       merry (cont'd)
             pippin!

as pippin lays his hands on the crystal, a sickly pale light
slowly spreads from the glass ball onto pippin's face ... his
eyes widen.

                       merry (cont'd)
             pippin!
