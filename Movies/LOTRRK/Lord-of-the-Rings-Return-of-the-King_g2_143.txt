tilt up . . . to reveal the orc and uruk-hai, gorbag and
shagrat, arguing over frodo's belongings and clothes! gorbag
is snatching for the mithril vest.

                        shagrat
             hey! hands off - that shiny shirt, that's
             mine.

                         gorbag
             it's going to the great eye, along with
             everything else . . .

angle on . . . frodo as he realizes that he has been stripped
down to his underwear. he clutches at his throat.

... the ring has gone!

                        shagrat

gorbag grabs for the mithril vest ...

             your guts!

angle on: gorbag draws his sword, but shagrat kicks him
backwards with his foot! gorbag falls through a trap door
leading to the floor below!
