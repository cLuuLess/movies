the phial flickers ... kindles into a silver flame - a bright
radiant starlight!

low angle on: the light instantly reveals a huge loathsome
spider . . . towering over frodo!

close on: shelob the spider hisses at the light! two great
clusters of many-windowed eyes protrude from her bulbous
head. her legs are bent, with a 12 foot span and hairs that
stick out like steel spines. her huge, swollen body, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. her age-old
black hide is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with livid marks
. . . but her belly underneath is pale and luminous.

shelob beats the air with her forelegs.

angle on: calling up all his remaining strength and
resolution, frodo forces his legs to move . . . he backs away -
keeping his eyes on shelob.

shelob crawls slowly towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous speed, she attacks!

she lashes out with her front legs ... frodo is flung back
... the glass phial clatters to the tunnel floor, casting an
eerie low light.

shelob squats above frodo, her eye clusters fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.

suddenly! frodo draws sting! he slashes wildly at the giant
spider . . . hewing off the tip of a leg!

shelob spasms . . . a wild blur of thrashing legs!

angle on: frodo leaps to his feet and runs - not even pausing
to pick up the phial of light!

tracking back: with frodo as he careers blindly down narrow
tunnels, gasping in the choking air ... looking back over his
shoulder for any sign of shelob.

angle on: frodo sees the tunnel exit ahead . . .

. . . just as he runs straight into a great cobweb!



                                                      (continued)

close on: frodo . . . eyes wild with fear . . . as he tries to
wrench sting free of the sticky web.

                      gollum o.s.
                (sing-song)
            naughty little fly,
            why does it cry?

angle on: gollum on the other side of the web . . .

                       gollum
            caught in a web
            soon you'll be . . .
            . ?. eaten!

angle on: frodo as he slashes wildly with sting. the shining
blade of sting as it hacks through the fibrous strands. they
whip and snap back into frodo's face as he cuts himself free.

angle on: back up the tunnel - lit by the light of galadriel -
shelob's heaving shadow approaches . . .

close on: gollum watches in mounting disbelief as sting
slashes through the web ... disbelief turns to fear as shelob
gets closer and closer, gollum quickly turns and bolts::.. . . .

frodo hacks at the web and with a last desperate lunge, frees
himself ... sting is caught in the web ... frodo leaves the
sword and throws himself through a narrow crevice . . .
