ext. west osgiliath, river anduin - night

wide on: an ancient stone bridge which spans the ruins of
east and west osgiliath - a once mighty gondorian city.

wide on: ithilien rangers patrolling the bridge and the
riverbank.

west osgiliath has fallen into disrepair, but the desolation
of east osgiliath is more pronounced - it is held by the
forces of mordor.

camera tracks down beneath the bridge to the dark waters . . .
catching a stealthy movement . . .

angle on: many boats, carrying murderous-looking orcs, are
quietly tracking down the river. on board several hunched
figures steer with long oars.
