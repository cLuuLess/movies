ext. pass of cirith ungol - day

angle on: frodo staggers through the pass of cirith ungol ...
the weight of the ring, dragging at his neck.

he moves forward, fueled by a grim resolve ...

angle on: frodo starts climbing a stone staircase that climbs
through a narrow pass ... tall peaks rise on either side,
like pillars holding up a sagging sky.

ahead is the summit of cirith ungol ... and an orc watch
tower! a faint light glows from within the stone tower . . .
the path over the summit is in full view of the orcs.

frodo stays close to the rock wall, masked by shadows.

low angle: behind frodo, shelob appears! with hideous
stealth, she follows frodo ...

angle on: frodo slowly climbing the stone stairs . . . his gaze
and concentration on the orc tower. behind him, shelob
lurches into a horrible scuttle down the sheer rock face.

close on: frodo suddenly senses the lurking malice . . . he
spins around: before he can react, shelob viciously stabs
frodo in the neck with her monstrous abdominal stinger!

frodo instantly goes limp . . . shelob's legs   catch him as he
                                                 around him. with
falls ... she quickly starts weaving cobwebs
great dexterity, she tumbles the little hobb    it over and over
in her legs, binding him in web from head to     toe!

suddenly!... the razor sharp edge of a sword comes into shot.

reveal on: samwise gamgee stands before the giant spider -
sting clutched in one hand, the shining phial in the other!

                      sam
           let him go, you filth!

shelob hisses at sam . . . dropping frodo . . . he rolls down the
stairs in his web cocoon.

                     sam (cont'd)
          you will not touch him again!

sam moves forward, a fell light in his normally friendly eyes


                     sam (cont'd)
          come on and finish it!

sam swings the small sword . . . slashing upward!



                                                     (continued)

angle on: shelob hisses and rears above sam, her stinger
dribbling with venom!

sam ducks inside the arch of her legs and stabs sting into
one of her eye clusters!

close on: shelob screams, her mandibles thrashing wildly,
green ooze trickling from her wounded eye.

with hind legs, shelob picks sam off the ground and tosses
him backwards! sam lands heavily . . . and shelob pounces!

angle on: shelob heaves the great bag of her belly high above
sam's head. as she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk
down on him, sam lifts the elven blade above his head,
holding it with two hands.

sting slides into shelob's soft underbelly! a shudder runs
through her! heaving up. again, she wrenches herself away from
the pain ... her limbs writhing beneath her.

angle on: jerking and quivering, shelob crawls to her hole,
leaving a trail of green-yellow slime. she squeezes down the
hole and disappears ... the sound of her bubbling misery
fades.                           .                       :

angle on: sam races to frodo . . .

                       sam (cont'd)
                (worried)
           mr frodo!                        .

close on: sam rips cobwebs away from frodo's head . . . his
face is deathly pale.

                      sam (cont'd)
                (panicking)
           oh no! frodo!

close on: frodo's pale, lifeless face.

                      sam (cont'd)
           mr frodo! wake up!

frodo's head lolls lifelessly in sam's arms.

                      sam (cont'd)
                (desperate whisper)
           wake up . . . don't leave me here alone.
           don't go where i can't follow. wake up!

close on: frodo staring, unmoving.

                       sam (cont'd)
                (numbly)
           not asleep ... dead.

sam lays his face on frodo's chest . . . weeping softly.

close on: sting's blade glows blue!

soundtrack: tramping feet approach . . . clinking metal . . .
harsh shouts!

close on: sam looks up . . . looks back down frodo.

close on: sam looks up at the orc tower and then at sting
which is glowing blue! orcs approach - sam must make a
decision.

angle on: a small party of orcs and uruk-hai heading down the
stairs from the watch tower! . . . shagrat leads the uruk-hai,
and gorbag leads the orcs.

gorbag spies frodo's body . . .

                      gorbag
           what's this? looks like old shelob's been
           having a bit of fun!

                      shagrat
           killed another one, has she?

angle on: gorbag peer curiously at frodo as he leans down and
pokes at frodo's lifeless body.

                      gorbag
           no . . . this fellow ain't dead.

close on: sam, hidden:in a rock crevice, as shock sweeps
across his face!

                       sam
                 (to himself)
            not dead!

                       gorbag
                 (excited).
            she jabs them with her stinger and they go
            as limp as a boned fish. then she has her
            way with them. that's how she likes to feed
            - fresh blood.
                 (yelling)
            get him to the tower!

                       sam
            samwise, you fool!

angle on: the orcs grunt as they lift frodo . . . and carry him
back towards the watch tower.

                       orc 2
            this fellow will be awake in a few hours.

                       gorbag
            then he'll wish he'd never been born.

orc laughter . . . frodo is carried up the steep stairs .;.. .
