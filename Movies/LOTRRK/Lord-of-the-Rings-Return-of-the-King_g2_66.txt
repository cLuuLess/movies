ext. cirith ungol ledge - dawn

aerial shot: . . . high above minas morgul, on the small ledge
next to the stairs, lie the figures of frodo, sam and gollum.

sam watches a sleeping gollum suspiciously as he desperately
tries to stay awake. slowly, inevitably, sam, falls asleep.

close on: gollum's eyes snap open . . . he sits up and quietly
crawls towards sam's knapsack.

sam breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

gollum grimaces in distaste as he pulls out the lembas bread
. .. quietly he sprinkles crumbs over the sleeping sam.

angle on: gollum as he throws the remaining lembas bread over
the cliff.

close on: sam's eyes flick open . . . gollum spins around,
caught off guard . . .

                        sam
             what are you up to? sneaking off, are we?

                        smeagol
                  (prevaricating)
             sneaking? sneaking? fat hobbit is always so
             polite. smeagol shows them secret ways that
             nobody else could find and they say
             "sneak!", "sneak!". very nice friends, oh
             yes, my precious, very nice.

                        sam
             alright, alright - you just startled me is
             all.
                  (peering over the cliff's edge)
             what were you doing?

                          smeagol
                  (sly)
             sneaking!

too exhausted to argue, sam turns away.

                        sam
             fine, have it your own way.

sam gently shakes frodo's shoulder.                            -

                        sam (cont'd)
             sorry to wake you, mr frodo. we have to be
             moving on.

sam rummages through his knapsack, looking for a bite to eat.
frodo sits up slowly.

                        frodo                              .
             it's dark still.

                        sam
             it's always dark here -

close on: sam stops rummaging . . . shock on his face.

                        sam (cont'd)
             it's gone . . . the elven bread!

                       frodo
                (alarmed)
           what? that's all we have left!

sam slowly turns to gollum ...

                      sam
                (dawning realisation)
           he took it! he must have!

                      gollum
                (shocked)
           smeagol? no, no, not poor smeagol. smeagol
           hates nasty elf bread!

                     sam
           you're a lying wretch! what did you do with
           it?

                      frodo
           he doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken
           it.

close on: gollum slaps his hand against sam's jacket . . .
sending lembas crumbs raining down!

                      gollum
           what's this? crumbs on his jacketses!
                (fake outrage)
           he took it! he took it! i seen him, he's
           always stuffing himself when master's not
           looking!

                       sam
                (angry)
           that's a filthy lie!

sam is enraged . . . he throws himself at gollum .. punching
him!

                       sam (cont'd)
                 (yelling)
           you stinking two-faced sneak! call me a
           thie . . .
               f

                        frodo
                 (yelling)
            sam! stop it!

frodo pulls sam off gollum ...

                        sam
                 (yelling)
            i'll kill him! i'll kill him!

                        frodo
            no, sam!

frodo collapses on the ground!

close on: sam's horrified face!

                       sam
            alight, i'm sorry, i didn't mean for it to
            go so far, i was so angry . . . here, let's
            rest up a bit.

sam attempts to fuss around frodo ...

                       frodo
                  (exhausted)
            i ' m alright.

                      sam
           no, no, you're not alright! you're
           exhausted! it's that gollum; it's this
           place; it's that thing around your neck. i
           could help a bit . . . i could carry it for a
           while - share the load.

close on: a terrible light comes into frodo's eyes as he
stares into the earnest eyes of sam.

                       frodo
           get away!

frodo pushes sam away, clutching at the ring beneath his shirt

                       sam
                 (confused)
            i don't want to keep it . . . i just want to
            help!

frodo rises to his feet, as if empowered with a frightening
intense energy.

                       gollum
            see! see! he wants it for himself.

                       sam
                 (beside himself)
            shut up, you! go away. get out of here.

close on: frodo ...

                         frodo
                  (quietly)
            no, sam . . . it's you.

sam stares at frodo with disbelief.
                                      /

                       frodo (cont'd)
            i'm sorry, sam ...

close on: tears well in sam's eyes . . .

                       sam
                 (hopelessly)
            but . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you
            against me.

                       frodo
            you can't help me anymore.

                       sam
            you don't mean that.

                       frodo
                 (eerie calm)
            go home.

close on: tears spill down sam's cheeks . . . as frodo turns away!

misery.
