ext. minas tirith - dawn

angle on: shadowfax gallops up onto a low ridge . . .

angle on: before them is the dark mass of mount mindolluin,
its tall white face whitening in the rising sun. upon its out-
thrust knee is the guarded city: minas tirith.

with seven walls of white stone, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, minas tirith looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

          minas tirith . . . city of the kings.

suddenly the sun climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends
forth a shaft of sunlight that gleams against th    e face of the
city. the tower of ecthelion stands high within     the topmost
walls. white banners break and flutter from the     battlements
in the morning breeze.
