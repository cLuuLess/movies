ext. slopes of mount doom - day

the volcano is erupting, fire belches from it's riven summit,
sending lava streaming down it's sides..

angle on: frodo and sam stagger out of the sammath naur door
. . . all around ash and molten rocks fall. the skies burst
into thunder, seared with lightning.

the screaming nazgul fall from the sky in flames!

the ground is shaking so violently that frodo and sam can
barely stand.

frodo stumbles . . . sam helps him up . . . frodo smiles.

                         frodo                    .          ..
             it's gone . . . it's done.

sam looks down at frodo ... frodo's face is at peace ... his
burden destroyed . . .

                        sam
             yes, mr. frodo ... it's over now.

frodo and sam crawl onto a rock as lava streams towards them
. . . in seconds their rock is an island in a sea of molten
fire.                                                     ,'
                                                           .

frodo shuts his eyes . . .

                        frodo
                  (remembering)
             i can see the shire ... the brandywine
             river, bag end, gandalf's fireworks . . . the
             lights in the party tree . . .
                                                       (continued)

                                      final revision - october, 2003 140.
continued:


                          sam
             rosie cotton dancing ... she had ribbons in
             her hair . . .
                   (sobs)
             . . . if ever i was to marry someone . . . it
             would have been her . . . it would have been
             her.

frodo glances at sam . . . he is weeping.

close on: frodo wrapping an arm around sam's shoulder.

                        frodo
                  (calm)
             i'm glad to be with you, samwise gamgee . . .
             here at the end of all things.

high wide: two tiny hobbits waiting to die amid a cataclysmic
landscape . . . lava erupts around them ... fireballs rain down
from the sky.

we slowly fade to black ...

fade up:

slow motion: gwaihir, the great eagle flaps towards camera
. . . he bears gandalf on his back, and is followed by two more
eagles.

wide shot . . . the eagles bravely fly amid the raining ash and
molten rocks ... and snatch frodo and sam from the rock!

close on: frodo's face . . . as the fiery volcano recedes away
beneath him . . . the wind ruffles his hair . . . he passes out.

fade to black.
