ext. tower of cirith ungol/courtyard - night

sam is confronted with the sight of over 50 slaughtered orc
and uruk-hai, strewn over the courtyard!

angle on: sam pounds up the staircase . . . he suddenly pauses.
several uruk-hai are running down towards him! he grips sting
and continues charging up - screaming at the top of his
lungs!

angle on: the four uruks . . . they see a huge distorted shadow
on the wall in front of them! they turn around and flee in
terror back to the top of the stairs!

sam appears - and before the uruk-hai can fully regain their
wits - he slays three ... yelling:

                       sam
                (yelling . . . 1st uruk-hai)             
                                                         ,
           that's for frodo!
                (yelling ... 2nd uruk-hai)
           and for the shire!
                (yelling . . . 3rd uruk-hai)
           and that's for my old gaffer!
                                               
sam runs into the tower . . .
