ext. pelennor fields, minas tirith - day

wide on: pelennor fields . . . strangely silent . . . all orcs
have fled ... battle debris and bodies stretch as far as the
eye can see...

above minas tirith ... blinding sun rays break through the
low clouds!

angle on: gandalf, legolas, gimli and pippin watch as . . .
aragorn walks slowly across the field of battle towards the
hideous ghouls ...

                       king of the dead
            release us.

                       gimli
                 (quietly)
            bad idea. very handy in a tight spot, these
            lads - despite the fact, they're dead!

                      king of the dead
            you gave us your word.

                       aragorn
            i hold your oath fulfilled . . . go. be at
            peace.

angle on: the army of the dead slowly dissolve into dust, and
are immediately swept away by the four winds.

aragorn turns to gandalf who bows his head in homage ...

pippin, in his gondorian armour, looks around at the
devastation ... his eyes full of sadness ... they suddenly
fix on something.

angle on: pippin running through the ruin of the battle . . .
towards a small figure slumped on the ground ...

                          pippin
             merry ...?

merry stares unseeing at pippin ... horror and shock erasing
all other memories from merry's mind ... tears fall down
pippin's face as he looks on his friend . . .

                         pippin (cont'd)
             merry . . . it's me, it's pippin . . .

                        merry
                  (groggy)
             i knew you'd find me.
                  (disorientated)
             are you going to leave me?

                       pippin
             no merry, i'm going to look after you.

angle on: pippin covers merry with a blanket . . .
