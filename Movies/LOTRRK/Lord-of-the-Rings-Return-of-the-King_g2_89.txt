angle on: before them, at the root of the mountain, a sheer
wall of rock towers . . .

                     gimli
               (terrified whisper)
          the very warmth of my blood seems stolen
          away.

within the walls, a creepy dark door gapes like a mouth of
night. signs and figures are carved above its wide arch.

                     legolas
               (translating)
          the way is shut. it was made by those who
          are dead, and the dead keep it. the way is
          shut.

at that moment: a chill wind seems to rush out of the doorway
. . . aragorn stares into the blackness, his hair blowing
wildly. the horses rear and'buck'in terror, turning and
galloping away.

                       aragorn
          brego!


                                                     (continued)

the three horses disappear ... aragorn turns resolutely
towards the doorway . . .

                       aragorn (cont'd)
                 (steely resolve)
             i do not fear death ...

angle on: aragorn walking into the blackness.

legolas quickly follows . . . swallowed by the darkness.

close on: gimli left alone . . . he hesitates, struggling with hi
fear.

                         gimli
             well, this is a thing unheard of ... an elf
             will go underground when a dwarf dare not.
                  (gritting his teeth)
             oh! i ' d never hear the end of it!

gimli plunges into the tunnel behind the others!
