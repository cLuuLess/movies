          how do you pick up the threads of an old
          life? how do you go on, when in your heart
          you begin to understand. there is no going
          back. there are some things that time
          cannot mend. some hurts that go too deep.
          that have taken hold.

angle on: frodo . . . from behind. he is hunched over a desk...

push in . . . to reveal bilbo's red book open on frodo's desk.
he is writing in the last chapters ...
                                                    (continued)

                                     final revision - october, 2003 145,
continued:
in careful neat handwriting. frodo turns back the pages,
revealing: there and back again - a hobbit's tale, by bilbo
baggins. he writes below it as sam gamgee calls out from the
door:

                      sam o.s
          mr frodo?

close on: frodo winces with a sharp gasp of pain . . . he puts ·
the pen down and clutches at his shoulder . . .

sam has entered the room and stands behind frodo ...

                     sam                 .
               (concerned)                       -
          what is it?                -

close on: frodo . . . he is drawn and pale.

                     frodo
          it's been four years to the day since
          weathertop, sam. it's never really healed.

close on: sam . . . at a loss for words. his eyes fall to the
book.                               .....'·

                      sam                         ,           "
               (reading)
          "there and back again . . . a      hobbit's tale,
          by bilbo baggins".

tilt down: to frodo's handwriting:

                      sam (cont'd)
               (reading)
          " . . . and the lord of the rings, by frodo
          baggins".
               (delighted)                                    :
          you've finished it!                                 -

                     frodo
               (closing the book)
          not quite . . . there's room for a little
          more.

                                                              cut to:
