ext. hobbiton - dusk

                      frodo v/0
           . . . we found ourselves looking upon a
           familiar sight . . . we were home!

matching move: revealing hobbiton bathed in a warm sunset ...
as frodo, sam, merry and pippin ride into shot on ponies ...
past odo proudfoot who shakes his head at the strangeness of
their appearance.
