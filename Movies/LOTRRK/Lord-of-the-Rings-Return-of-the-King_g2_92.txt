merry is bitterly disappointed. he stands, head down - a tiny
dejected figure - as the mighty rohirrim on their large
horses ride by . . . a jangling sea of helmets, shields and
banners.

suddenly . . . merry is plucked off the ground! a soldier has
snatched him by the collar ... and plonked him down on their
saddle!

close on: merry twists around, looking up at the soldier . . .
beneath a helmet and mail hood is . . .

. . . eowyn, disguised as a man!

                       eowyn
                (grimly)
           ride with me.

                         merry
           my lady!

close on: merry's face visible under the cape . . . looking
excited!

                       eomer
                 (shouting above the din)
            move out - move out!

                       theoden
            ride! ride now, for gondor!
