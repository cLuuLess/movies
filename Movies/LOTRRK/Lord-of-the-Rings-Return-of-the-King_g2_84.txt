angle on: as aragorn readies brego for leaving eowyn
approaches ... her temper barely held in check.

                       eowyn
            why are you doing this?

aragorn looks over his shoulder at her . . .

            the war lies to.the east. you cannot leave
            on the eve of battle. you cannot abandon         ;
            the men.

continued:


aragorn rounds on her ...

                       aragorn
             why have you come?

                        eowyn
                  (hesitant)
             do you not know?

aragorn looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her.

                        aragorn
                  (gentle)
             it is but a shadow and a thought that you
             love . . . i cannot give you what you seek.

eowyn steps back at though struck . . . she watches stricken as
aragorn leaves . . .
