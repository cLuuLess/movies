gregory  doesn’t  answer.  he  smashes  a  side-kick  into  neo’s gut,
doubling him over.

the kick carries  such an impact  that a pale  concussion wave flashes
past gregor. it sends neo crashing out the window.

gregory stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the  three
agents. there’s nothing on the street, twenty stories below.

the building  starts trembling.  we hear  rapid-fire impacts,  growing
louder and coming faster.

the floor explodes  as neo crashes  up through the  concrete, throwing
the agents away as  he embraces gregory in  a bear hug. they  blast up
through the ceiling. we follow them up through three more floors, bam,
bam, bam. each concrete floor smashes gregory in the head.
