the five  of them  exit. they  blend into  the crowds  on the  street,
anonymous and  quiet. morpheus  looks back  as neo,  taller than most,
heads down the street.

                      niobe pauses next to him.

                                niobe

                            "what is it?"

                      morpheus shakes his head.

                               morpheus

     "what’s going to happen? if this is it, right now? the end?"

                                niobe

                       "i can’t even imagine."

he grins  and starts  to turn.  as he  does, his  profile matches  the
profile on  a wanted  poster stuck  to the  wall. it’s  a dark, grainy
picture of him, alongside photos of neo, and trinity.

                   poster: international terrorists

              morpheus glances at it, and continues on.


ext. downtown street

neo walks  calmly, observing  the people  that filter  by. men, women,
children, all oblivious to their true nature.

a dirty homeless whino, nose  explosion red with burst blood  vessels,
is  staggering  along  the  edge of  the  crowd,  unseen  and ignored.
somehow, he catches neo’s eye.

                               homeless

                      "spare a quarter, buddy?"

                neo shakes his head, but still stares.
