int. hobbit's room, prancing pony -- night

insert: merry snoring softly on his pillow.

insert: pippin stirs slightly, then settles back to sleep.
wide on: the door creaks open...the four ringwraiths silently
slide into the hobbit's room. the loom above each bed,
raising their shining swords above the sleeping hobbits.
quick insert: sam's eyes open wide. in unison, the ringwraits
stab the hobbits, in a slashing, hacking frenzy.
