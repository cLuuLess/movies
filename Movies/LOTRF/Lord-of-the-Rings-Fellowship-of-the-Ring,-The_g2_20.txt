int. citadel chamber, minas tirith -- night

close on: pages flipping as gandalf searches ancient scrolls
and books placed high on a wooden table. his eyes settle on
one old parchment. he murmurs hurriedly to himself, reading.

                    gandalf
              (reading)
          the year 3434 of the second age...here
          follows the account of isildur, high king
          of gondor, and the finding of the ring of
          power.

                                                   dissolve to:

close on: isildur, triumphant, reaches for the one ring, his

eyes fixated on it.

                    gandalf
              (reading)
          it has come to me...the ring of power!

                                                   (continued)

continued:
                    gandalf (cont'd)
          it shall be an heirloom of my
          kingdom...all those who follow in my
          bloodline shall be bound to its fate, for
          i will risk no hurt to the

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          ring...it is precious to me, though i buy
          it with great pain...

close on: elvish lettering marks on the faded old document

in gandalf's hand.

                    gandalf
              (reading)
          the marking upon the band begin to
          fade...the writing which at first was as
          clear as red flame, has all but
          disappeared...a secret now that only fire
          can tell...
