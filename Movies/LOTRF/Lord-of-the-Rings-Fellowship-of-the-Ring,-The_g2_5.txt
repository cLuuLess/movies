                                                       crane up:

as the cart rattles into the small village of hobbiton...a
quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills
and large trees.

                                                    (continued)

continued:

the hobbits live in hobbit holes: neat burrows dug into the
grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens.

                                                     angle on:

excited children, chasing after the cart.

                                                     close on:

gandalf ignorcs the children's cries. the children stand
deflated, watching gandalf disappear up the lane. at that
moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of
the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children.

                                                     angle on:

gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. odo
proudfoot is unable to suppress a chuckle. frodo stands up in
the cart as gandalf reigns in the horse.

                    frodo
          gandalf... i'm glad you're back. frodo
          leaps expertly from the cart. gandalf
          smiles.

                    gandalf
          so am i, dear boy...so am i
