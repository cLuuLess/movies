glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

                    frodo (cont'd)
          would you destroy it?

                    aragorn
              (kneeling to frodo)
          i would have gone with you to the end...
          into the very fires of mordor.

                    frodo
          i know...look after the others,
          especially sam...he will not understand.

aragorn freezes!   he draws his sword.

                     aragorn
              (urgent)
          go, frodo!

frodo hesitates.
