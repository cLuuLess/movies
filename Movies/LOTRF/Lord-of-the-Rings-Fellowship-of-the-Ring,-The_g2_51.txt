int. "prancing pony" inn -- night

sam looks sick; pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly;
the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into

motion background. he suddenly clutches his head as he is
hit with quick images...of a great eye! an evil cat-like
eye, wreathed in flames.

pulling the ring from his finger. frodo materializes into the
real world. at that moment: a large hand reaches under the
table and grabs frodo by the collar, and drags him away!
