int. strider's room -- night

wide on: sam, merry, and pippin have been sleeping on
strider's bed. frodo stands next to strider by the window,
peering out nervously as furious ringwraith screeches echo
across the courtyard from the hobbits room.

                    frodo
          where are they?

                    strider
          they were once men. strider glances
          quickly at frodo, then looks away...

                    strider (v.o.) (cont'd)
              (quietly)
          great kings of men. then sauron the
          deceiver gave to them nine rings of
          power. blinded by their greed they took
          them without question, one by one falling
          into darkness and now they are slaves to
          his will.

strider looks from the window as the ringwraiths gallop down
the bree streets. close on: strider turns back to the
hobbits, his face lit faintly by the glowing embers of the
fire.

                    strider (cont'd)
          they are the nazgul, ringwraiths, neither
          living or dead. at all times they feel
          the presence of the ring...drawn to the
          power of the one..they will never stop
          hunting you.
