ext. pillars of the kings, river anduin--dawn

the three elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the pre-dawn light. close on: aragorn, slowly
paddling in the stern.

                    aragorn
              (quietly)
          frodo.

frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. wide
on: two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
gondorian kings of old. they loom over the boats with power
and majesty.

                    aragorn (cont'd)
          the argonath...

close on: aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. he speaks, almost as if to himself.

                    aragorn (cont'd)
              (deeply moved)
          long have i desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.

the fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the statues' feet.

                                                 (continued)

continued:


wide on: craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to
reveal a large lake only a mile down river...
