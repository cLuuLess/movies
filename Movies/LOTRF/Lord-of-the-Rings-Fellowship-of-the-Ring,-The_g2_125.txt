ext. caras galadhon lawn -- night

gimli, legolas, merry, pippin, frodo and sam are in a
pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. they lie on
soft couches as elves leave food and wine for them. mournful
singing drifts down from the trees above.

                    legolas
              (sadly)
          a lament for gandalf...

                    merry
          what do they say about him?

                    legolas
          i have not the heart to tell you. for me,
          the grief is still too near. boromir is
          sitting alone...aragorn approaches him.

                     aragorn
          take some rest..these borders are well
          protected.

moonlight catches the trace of tears on boromir's face.
aragorn kneels down beside him.

                    boromir
          i will find no rest here. i heard her
          voice inside my head...she spoke of my
          father and the fall of gondor, and she
          said to me: "even now, there

                    boromir (cont'd)
          is hope left. but i cannot see it...it
          is long since we had any hope.

close on: boromir looks at aragorn in despair.

                    boromir (cont'd)
          my father is a noble man, but his rule is
          failing and our..our people lose faith.
          he looks to me to make things right...and
          i would do it, i would see the glory of
          gondor restored. have you ever seen it,
          aragorn? the white tower of ecthelion,
          glimmering like a spike of pearl and
          silver, its banners caught high in the
          morning breeze...have you ever been
          called home by the clear ringing of
          silver trumpets?

                    aragorn
          i have seen the white city..long ago.

                                                   (continued)

continued:


boromir feels aragorn's love for minas tirith and takes
heart,

                      boromir
            one day our paths will lead us there, and
            the tower guards shall take up the call
             "the lords of gondor have returned."

aragorn returns boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet
sadness only when boromir looks away.

later....

the fellowship are asleep on their beds. gimli is snoring
loudly. close on: bare feet tread soundlessly across the
lawn. close on: frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by
instinct. galadriel, her white dress glowing in the
moonlight, glances at him. frodo follows her...as if drawn by
an invisible force.
