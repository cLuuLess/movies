ext. pass of caradhras -- day

the fellowship are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up
towards the pass of caradhras. legolas the elf moves lightly
across the top of the snow...he suddenly pauses. saruman's
voice sweeps by in the wind.

                    legolas
              (urgent)
          there is a fell voice in the air.

                    gandalf
          it's saruman.

thunder rumbles...rock and shale fall from above.

                    aragorn
              (urgently)
          he's trying to bring down the mountain.
          gandalf! we must turn back!

                       gandalf
          no!

gandalf raises his staff...he chants into the wind.

                    gandalf
              (yelling)
          losto caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i
          ruith. sleep caradhras, be still, lie
          still, hold your wrath.
