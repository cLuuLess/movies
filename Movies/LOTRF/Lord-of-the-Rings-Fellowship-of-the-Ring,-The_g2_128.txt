stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. close on: frodo is frozen. unable
to move or cry out. the ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. fire
erupts around the eye... with a yell, frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. light
instantly fades from the mirror. frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.

                    galadriel
          i know what it is you saw...for it is
          also in my mind. it is the future,
          frodo. it is what will come to pass if
          you should fail.

galadriel looks at frodo intensely...frodo looks down...in
his hand he is clutching the ring. frodo looks up at
galadriel.

                    galadriel (cont'd)
          the fellowship is breaking. it has
          already begun. he will try to take the
          ring. you know of whom i speak. one by
          one, it will destroy them all.

                    frodo (v.o.)
          if you ask it of me, i will give you the
          one ring.

                                                   (continued)

continued:


                    galadriel
          you offer it to me freely...i do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.

galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before frodo's
eyes. frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

                    galadriel (cont'd)
          in place of the dark lord, you would have
          a queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the dawn. treacherous as the
          sea! stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! frodo takes a step away from
          galadriel...

galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

                    galadriel (cont'd)
              (gently)
          i pass the test.
              (laughs)
          i will diminish and go into the west and
          remain galadriel. frodo's confidence
          drains away.

                    frodo
          i cannot do this alone...

                    galadriel
          you are the ring-bearer, frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. this task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.

frodo realizes what her message is.

                    frodo
          then i know what i must do. it's
          just...i'm afraid to do it. galadriel
          kneels down to frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.

                    galadriel
          even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.

the ring lies in the palm of frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.

                                                      cut to:
