int. bag end living room -- day

bilbo leads gandalf into bag end...cozy and cluttered with
souvenirs of bilbo's travels. gandalf has to stoop to avoid
hitting his head on the low ceiling. bilbo hangs up gandalf's
hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.

                    bilbo
              (calling)
          tea? or maybe something stronger... i've
          a few bottles of the old winyard left,
          1296...a very good year, almost as old as
          i am. it was laid down by my father. what
          say we open one, eh?

bilbo disappears into the kitchen as gandalf looks
around..enjoying the familiarity of bag end...he turns,
knocking his head on the light and then walking into the
wooden beam. he groans.

                    bilbo (o.s.) (cont'd)
          i was expecting you some time last week.
          not that it matters, you come and go as
          you please, always have done, always
          will.
                    (more)


                                                    (continued)

continued:
                    bilbo (o.s.) (cont'd)
          you've caught me a bit unprepared, i'm
          afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit
          of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no,
          that might be a little risky...

gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one
corner...it is thorin's map of the lonely mountain, gandalf
smiles to himself.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          er, we've got raspberry jam and apple
          tart...got some custard somewhere. not
          much for afters, i'm afraid. oh
          no...we're alright...i've just found some
          sponge cake. nice little snack. hope
          it's enough.
              (comes into view)
          i could do you some eggs if you like?

bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as gandalf
mysteriously appears behind him.

                    gandalf
          just tea, thank you.

                       bilbo
          oh..right.     you don't mind if...?

                    gandalf
          no, not at all. go ahead. a sudden loud
          knock on the front door.

mrs. sackville baggins (o.s.)

bilbo baggins, you open this door..i know you're in there.

                    bilbo
          i'm not home.

gandalf watches, amused as bilbo tries to hide.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          i've got to get away from these
          confounded relatives, hanging on the bell
          all day, never giving me a moment's
          peace. i want to see mountains
          again...mountains, gandalf... and then
          find somewhere quiet where i can finish
          my book...oh, tea!

                    gandalf
          so, you mean to go through with your
          plan, then?


                                                  (continued)

continued:


                    bilbo
          yes, yes...it's all inhand.   all the
          arrangements are made.

                    gandalf
          frodo suspects something.

                    bilbo
          'course he does, he's a baggins...not
          some block headed bracegirdle from
          hardbottle!

                    gandalf
          you will tell him, won't you?

                      bilbo
          yes, yes.

                    gandalf
          he's very fond of you.

                    bilbo
          i know. he'd probably come with me if i
          asked him. i think, in his heart,
          frodo's still in love with the shire, the
          woods and the fields... little rivers.
          bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen
          window.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          i am old, gandalf... bilbo looks at
          gandalf sadly...

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          i know i don't look it, but i'm beginning
          to feel it in my heart.

                                                      close on:

bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping
a small, unseen object.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          i feel thin...sort of stretched, like
          butter scraped over too much bread. i
          need a holiday...a very long holiday and
          i don't expect i shall return...in fact,
          i mean not to.
