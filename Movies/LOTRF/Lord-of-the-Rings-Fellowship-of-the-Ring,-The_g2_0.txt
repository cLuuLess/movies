black screen

super: new line cinema presents

super: a wingnut films production

black continues... elvish singing....a woman's voice is
whispering, tinged with sadness and regret:

                    galadriel (v.o.)
              (elvish: subtitled)
          "i amar prestar sen: han mathon ne nen,
          han mathon ne chae...a han noston ned
          wilith."
              (english:)
          the world is changed: i feel it in the
          water, i feel it in the earth, i smell it
          in the air...much that once was is lost,
          for none now live who remember it.

super: the lord of the rings
