ext. midgewater moors -- day

aerial on: strider leading frodo, sam, merry, and pippin
across the windswept moors. the hobbits suddenly stop and
unstrap their knapsacks.

                     strider
          gentlemen, we do not stop until
          nightfall.

                    pippin
          what about breakfast?

                    strider
          you've already had it.

                    pippin
          we've had one, yes...but what about
          second breakfast?

strider stares at pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking
his head.

                    merry
          i don't think he knows about second
          breakfast, pip.

                    pippin
          what about elvenses, luncheon, afternoon
          tea, dinner...he knows about them,
          doesn't he?

                    merry
          i wouldn't count on it.

an apple is thrown to merry, who deftly catches it.   another,
aimed at pippin, catches him on the forehead.

                                                 (continued)

continued:


                    merry (cont'd)
              (exasperated)
          pippin!

the hobbits trudge through rain, looking tired, hungry, and
miserable.
