ext. farmer's fields -- day

wide on: frodo and sam walking along a country lane which
borders farmer maggot's fields. sam is looking up...frodo has
disappeared around a corner in the lane.

                     sam
               (panicked)
          mr. frodo. mr. frodo! frodo turns,
          surprised as sam comes running towards
          him.

                    sam (cont'd)
              (worried)
          i thought i lost you. frodo looks at sam
          suspiciously. sam glances down,
          embarrassed.

                    frodo
              (teasing)
          what are you talking about?

                    sam
              (mumbling)
          it's just something gandalf said...

                    frodo
          what did he say?

                    sam
          he said..."don't you leave him, samwise
          gamgee."
              (looks at frodo intently)
          and i don't mean to.

                    frodo
              (laughing)
          sam...we're still in the shire...what
          could possibly happen?


                                                    (continued)

continued:


suddenly! a figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending
frodo flying. frodo picks himself up, only to be knocked back
down again by pippin.

                     pippin
          frodo!   merry, it's frodo baggins.

                    merry
          hello frodo

merry, pippin, and frodo picking themselves up... a variety
of vegetables have scattered everywhere.

                    sam
          what's the meaning of this!

                    merry
          sam, hold this...

merry gives sam a large cabbage.

                    sam
              (accusing)
          you've been into farmer maggot's crop!

a large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the
hedgerow...angry shouts from farmer maggot.

                    farmer maggot    (o.s.)
          who's that in my field!     get out of it!
          get out of my field, you    young varmits!
          i'll show you...get out    of my corn.

merry and pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race
away...with frodo and sam on their heels.

                    merry
              (looking behind him)
          i don't know why he's so upset, it's only
          a couple of carrots.

                    pippin
          and some cabbages...and those three bags
          of potatoes that we lifted last week.
          and then the mushrooms the week before.

                    merry
          yes, pippin, my point is, he's clearly
          over reacting.

the baying of large dogs sounds!



                                                       (continued)
