ext. shore of nen hithoel -- day

on the lakeshore frodo stands in front of one of the elvish
boats, the ring in his palm. a distraught sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...

                        sam
           mr. frodo!

close on: frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.

                     frodo (v.o.)
           i wish the ring had never come to me..i
           wish none of this had happened...

tears fall down frodo's face...

                     gandalf (v.o.)
           so do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. all we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.

with renewed determination, frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. the small figure of frodo pushing the elvish
boat into the water... sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...frodo is already paddling away.

                     sam
               (anguished)
           not alone, frodo. mr. frodo! frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the

shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of sam carried on the
wind. frodo whispers to himself

                        frodo
           no, sam.

sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

splash!   frodo turns to see sam launching himself into the
water.



                                                     (continued)

continued:


                    frodo (cont'd)
          go back,sam. i'm going to mordor alone.

sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

                    sam
          of course you are...and i'm coming with
          you!

                    frodo
          you can't swim.

sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

                       frodo (cont'd)
                 (frightened)
          sam!

sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
close on: frodo's hand grasping sam's... frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned sam into the boat. frodo and sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

                     sam
          i made a promise, mr. frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "don't you leave him, samwise gamgee."
              (sobs)
          and i don't mean to...i don't mean to.

                    frodo
              (crying)
          oh, sam!

frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

                    frodo (cont'd)
          come on then..

the two hobbits row through the water...
