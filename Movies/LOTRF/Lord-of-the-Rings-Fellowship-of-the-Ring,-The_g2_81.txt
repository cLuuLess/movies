int. frodo's delirium -- day

delirious images and sounds....

                    arwen (v.o.)
          what grace is given me, let it pass to
          him. let him be spared. save him.

image: a bright light suddenly flares...frodo squeezes his
eyes shut, gasping.

                    frodo
              (frightened)
          where am i?

a familiar voice cuts through the swirl of sound.

                    gandalf (o.s.)
          you are in the house of elrond, and it is
          ten o'clock in the morning on october the
          twenty-fourth, if you want to know.
