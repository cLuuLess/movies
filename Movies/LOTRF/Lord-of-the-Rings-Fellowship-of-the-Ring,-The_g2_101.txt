                                                        angle on:

the fellowship clamber through rock and snow. close on: frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the ring
falls on the ground... close on: the ring gleaming in the
snow! boromir's hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. he seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. aragorn warily approaches
boromir...boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.

                     aragorn
          boromir?

                    boromir
          it is a strange fate that we should
          suffer so much fear and doubt over so
          small a thing...such a little thing.

                    aragorn
              (quietly)
          boromir...give the ring to frodo.
          aragorn's hand moves to his sword hilt.

                                                      (continued)

continued:


ring's pov...looking up at boromir's face. the strange hum
vibrates on the soundtrack. close on: a weird beatific smile
lights up boromir's face...the hum grows to a deafening roar!
boromir suddenly snaps out of his trance and hands the ring
back to frodo.

                    boromir
              (lightly)
          as you wish. i care not.

boromir smiles at frodo, ruffling his hair. close on: aragon
unhands his sword.
