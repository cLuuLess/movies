ext. pass of caradhras -- day

saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship
like thunder. a lightning crack explodes on the mountainside
above them. frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche
thunders down towards them! the fellowship throw themselves
against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge.
legolas pulls gandalf to safety. aragorn shields frodo and
sam as snow piles around them. within moments, the pass is
blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. boromir
and aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits...who are pulled
out shivering and fearful.

                    boromir
              (urgent)
          we must get off the mountain! make for
          the gap of rohan and take the west road
          to my city.

                    aragorn
          the gap of rohan takes us too close to
          isengard.

                    gimli
          we cannot pass over the mountain. let us
          go under it. let us go through the mines
          of moria. gandalf has a concerned look on
          his face.


                                                    (continued)

continued:


                    saruman (v.o.)
          moria. you fear to go into those mines,
          don't you? the dwarves delved too
          greedily and too deep.

                    saruman (v.o.) (cont'd)
          you know what they awoke in, the darkness
          of khazad-dum. shadow and flame.

                    gandalf
          let the ringbearer decide.

close on: frodo, the weight of the decision weighing heavily
upon him. close on: merry and pippin shivering in boromir's
arms.

                      gandalf (cont'd)
          frodo?

frodo meets gandalf's eye.

                    frodo
          we will go through the mines. gandalf
          slowly nods.

                      gandalf
          so be it.
