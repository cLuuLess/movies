ext. shore of nen hithoel -- day

angle on: the fellowship

as they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

                    aragorn
          we cross the lake at nightfall, hide the
          boats and continue on foot..we approach
          mordor from the north.

                    gimli
              (gloomy)
          oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through emyn muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. and
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

                    aragorn
          that is our road...i suggest you take
          some rest and recover your strength,
          master dwarf.

                    gimli
              (indignant)
          recover my...

legolas turns to aragorn with urgency.

                    legolas
          we should leave now.

                    aragorn
          no. orcs patrol the eastern shore. we
          must wait for cover of darkness.

                    legolas
          it is not the eastern shore that worries
          me.

legolas casts a glance around into the parth galen forest...

                    legolas (cont'd)
          a shadow and a threat has been growing in
          my mind. something draws near, i can
          feel it.


                                                  (continued)

continued:


aragorn looks at legolas, knowing full well what he means.
sam has slumped asleep...merry dumps a small pile of kindling
at gimli's feet...

                    merry
          where's frodo?

sam sits up with a start...aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. close on: aragorn.... as he realizes boromir has gone!
