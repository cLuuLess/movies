close on: frodo...eyes flickering open. he suddenly sits up,
sniffing the air. sam, merry, and pippin huddled over a small
fire... sausages and bacon sizzle in a hot frying pan.

                    frodo
          what are you doing?

                    merry

frodo, sam, merry and pippin clamber desperately towards the
