ext.  rooftop - day

we rush at the roof access door as it suddenly slams open
and the three agents charge out.

but neo, trinity and morpheus are already gone.

                         agent smith
          damnit!

                         agent brown
          the trace was completed.

                         agent jones
          we have their position.

                         agent brown
          the extermination unit is in place.

                         agent jones
          order the strike.

agent smith can't stand listening to them.  he moves to
the edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding
city.

                         agent smith
          they're not out yet.
