int.  elevator shaft - day

neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable.  both
of them lock on.  he looks up the long, dark throat of the
building and takes a deep breath.

                         neo
          there is no spoon.

neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower
than they attached themselves.

boom!  the cable snaps.

the counter-weights plummet, yanking trinity and neo up
through the shaft as --

the elevator falls away beneath them, distending space,
filling it with the sound of whistling metal as they sear
to the top.
