ext.  street - day

cypher is standing at a public phone.  across the street
is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided
with an oncoming car.

                         cypher
          there was an accident.  a fucking
          car accident.  all of a sudden.
          boom.  jesus, someone's going to
          make a believer out of me.

                         tank (v.o.)
          i got you.

                         cypher
          just get me outta here.

                         tank (v.o.)
          nearest exit is franklin and erie.
          an old appliance store.

cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.
