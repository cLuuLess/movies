trinity turns around, her face tight.

                         trinity
          what did you just say?

                         neo
          nothing.  just had a little deja vu.

                         trinity
          what happened?  what did you see?

                         neo
          a black cat went past us and then i
          saw another that looked just like
          it.

                         trinity
          how much like it?  was it the same
          cat?

                         neo
          it might have been.  i'm not sure.

trinity looks at morpheus who listens quietly to the
rasping breath of the old building.

                         neo
          what is it?

                         trinity
          a deju vu is usually a glitch in the
          matrix.  it happens when they change
          something.

she also listens as the staccato beat of helicopter blades
grows ominously loud.
