ext.  rooftop

summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, neo
launches himself into the air in a single maniacal
shriek --

but comes up drastically short.

his eyes widen as he plummets.  stories fly by, the ground
rushing up at him, but as he hits --

the ground gives way, stretching like a trapeze net.  he
bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on his
back.

he laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from
his face.

morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.

                         morpheus
          do you know why you didn't make it?

                         neo
          because... i didn't think i would?

morpheus smiles and nods.
