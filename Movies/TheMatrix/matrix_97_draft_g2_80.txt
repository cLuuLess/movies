int.  sitting room - day

morpheus rises from a couch as the priestess escorts neo
out.  when they are alone, morpheus puts his hand on neo's
shoulder.

                         morpheus
          there is a rule that no one can ask
          what the oracle said to you.  what
          was said was said for you and you
          alone.

he smiles.

                         morpheus
          i can see it in your eyes, that you
          are still confused.  that's all
          right, neo.  give it time, let it
          all sink in.  i know it can be
          difficult to see the path even when
          it's right under your feet.

neo nods and takes a bite of his cookie.
