int.  elevator

the idea of learning one's fate begins to weigh upon neo
with a steadily growing unease.

                         neo
          so is this the same oracle that made
          the, uh, prophecy?

                         morpheus
          yes.  she's very old.  she's been
          with us since the beginning.

                         neo
          the beginning?

                         morpheus
          of the resistance.

                         neo
          and she knows what?  everything?

                         morpheus
          she would say she knows enough.

                         neo
          how does she know?

                         morpheus
          she is a true psychic.  she sees
          beyond the relativity of time.  for
          her there is no past, present or
          future.  there is only what is.

                         neo
          and she's never wrong.

                         morpheus
          don't think of it in terms of right
          and wrong.  she is a guide, neo.
          she can help you find the path.

                         neo
          she helped you?

                         morpheus
          yes.

                         neo
          what did she tell you?

                         morpheus
          that i would find the one.

ding.  the elevator opens.
