int.  room 1313 - day

mouse goes to the draped windows as his cellular rings.
he answers it.

                         tank (v.o.)
          they cut the hardline!  it's a trap!
          get out!

mouse yanks open the curtain.

                         mouse
          oh no.

the windows are bricked up.  mouse spins as the rumble of
combat boots builds, then explodes into the room.
