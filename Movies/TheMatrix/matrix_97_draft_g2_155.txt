ext.  roof - day

the roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as neo and
trinity stand amongst a pile of their fallen enemies.

across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter
watches the last of their ferocious onslaught.

                         pilot
          i repeat, we are under attack!

suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by
spreading locust-like swarm of static as --

agent jones emerges.

just as she drops the final marine, trinity sees what's
coming.

neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is
behind him.

screaming, he whirls, guns filling his hands with thought-
speed.

fingers pumping, shells ejecting, dancing up and away, we
look through the sights and gunsmoke at --

the agent blurred with motion --

until the hammers click against the empty metal.

                         neo
          trinity!

agent jones charges.

                         neo
          ... help.

his gun booms as we enter the liquid space of --

bullet-time.

the air sizzles with wads of lead like angry flies as neo
twists, bends, ducks just between them.

agent jones still running, narrows the gap, the bullets
coming faster until --

neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a
spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.

he starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
his thigh.

he has only time to look up, to see agent jones standing
over him, raising his gun a final time.

                         agent jones
          only human...

suddenly agent jones stops.  he hears a sharp metal click.

immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the
muzzle of trinity's .45 --

jammed tight to his head.

                         trinity
          dodge this, mutherfucker!

boom!  boom!  boom!  the body flies back with a flash of
mercurial light and when it hits the ground --

it is the pilot.

trinity helps neo up.

                         trinity
          neo, how did you do that?

                         neo
          do what?

                         trinity
          you moved like they moved.  i've
          never seen anyone move that fast.

                         neo
          it wasn't fast enough.

he checks his shoulder wound.

                         trinity
          are you all right?

                         neo
          i'm fine.  come on, we have to keep
          moving.

neo sees the helicopter.

                         neo
          can you fly that thing.

                         trinity
          not yet.

she pulls out the cellular phone.
