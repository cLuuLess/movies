int.  dojo

neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls himself
at morpheus.

                         morpheus
          good.  adaptation.  improvisation.
          but your weakness isn't your
          technique.

morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.
his feet and fists are everywhere, taking neo apart.  for
every blow neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --

neo falls.

panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits from his
mouth, speckling the white floor of the dojo.

                         morpheus
          how did i beat you?

                         neo
          you -- you're too fast.

                         morpheus
          do you think my being faster,
          stronger has anything to do with my
          muscles in this place?

neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.

                         morpheus
          do you believe that's air you are
          breathing now?

neo stands, nodding slowly.

                         morpheus
          again.

their fists fly with pneumatic speed.
