int.  main deck

suddenly, a white bolt of lightning explodes against
tank's chair, blasting him into the air.

cypher checks the gun, unable to believe he missed.

                         cypher
          shit.

tank is on his feet, lunging when cypher fires again,
square into his chest.

                         dozer
          no!
