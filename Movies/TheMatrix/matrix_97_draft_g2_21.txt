ext.  city street - night

it is just beyond the middle of the night; that time when
it seems there are no rules and everything feels unsafe.

neo's boots scrape against the concrete.  every pair of
eyes he passes seems to follow him.

as he reaches the bridge, headlights creep in behind him.
he turns just as the car slides quickly to a stop beside
him.  the back door opens.

                         trinity
          get in.
