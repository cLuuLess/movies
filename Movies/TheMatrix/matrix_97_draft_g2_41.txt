int.  neo's room

he blinks, regaining consciousness.  the room is dark.
neo is stretched out on his bed.

                         neo
          i can't go back, can i?

morpheus is sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
corner.

                         morpheus
          no.  but if you could, would you
          really want to?

deep down, neo knows that answer.

                         morpheus
          i feel that i owe you an apology.
          there is a rule that we do not free
          a mind once it reaches a certain
          age.  it is dangerous.  they have
          trouble letting go.  their mind
          turns against them.  i've seen it
          happen.  i broke the rule because i
          had to.

he stares into the darkness, confessing as much to himself
as to neo.

                         morpheus
          when the matrix was first built
          there was a man born inside that had
          the ability to change what he
          wanted, to remake the matrix as he
          saw fit.  it was this man that freed
          the first of us and taught us the
          secret of the war; control the
          matrix and you control the future.

he pauses.

                         morpheus
          when he died, the oracle prophesied
          his return and envisioned an end to
          the war and freedom for our people.
          that is why there are those of us
          that have spent our entire lives
          searching the matrix, looking for
          him.

neo can feel his eyes on him.

                         morpheus
          i did what i did because i believe
          the search is over.

he stands up.

                         morpheus
          get some rest.  you're going to need
          it.

                         neo
          for what?

                         morpheus
          your training.
