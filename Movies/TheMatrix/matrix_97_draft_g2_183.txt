ext.  city street - day

a businessman walks along the sidewalk, wheeling and
dealing into his cell phone when it disappears, snatched
by neo as he flashes by.

                         man
          what the shit -- my phone!

the man turns to call for help and when he turns back, it
is agent smith.

neo is in a full out sprint, spinning and weaving away
from every pedestrian, every potential agent.

he flips open the cell phone and dials long distance.
