into view --

neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine
gun.

                         agent smith
          no.

the gun jumps and bullets explode through the window in a
cacophony of crashing glass --

as the agents go for their weapons.

but neo is too close, the .50 caliber too fast and bullets
are everywhere, perforating the room.

agent smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back,
blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --

then agent brown, his gun still firing as his body falls.

and finally agent jones.

neo stares at morpheus, trying to will him into action.

                         neo
          get up, morpheus!  get up!

neo grabs the climbing rope and attaches one end to his
harness.
