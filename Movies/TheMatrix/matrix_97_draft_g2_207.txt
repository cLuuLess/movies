int.  main deck

in tears, morpheus takes hold of the emp switch.

trinity whispers in neo's ear.

                         trinity
          neo, please, listen to me.  i
          promised to tell you the rest.  the
          oracle, she told me that i'd fall in
          love and that man, the man i loved
          would be the one.  you see?  you
          can't be dead, neo, you can't be
          because i love you.  you hear me?  i
          love you!

her eyes close and she kisses him, believing in all her
heart that he will feel her lips and know that they speak
the truth.
