neo looks at morpheus whose body is covered with a cold
sweat.

                         neo
          what are they doing to him?

                         tank
          they're hacking his mind.

                         neo
          how?

                         tank
          they inject virus-like serums to
          attack the neuro-systems.  it's like
          cracking a computer.  all it takes
          is time.

                         neo
          how much time?

                         tank
          depends on the mind.  but
          eventually, it will crack and his
          alpha pattern will change from this
          to this.

tank punches several commands on morpheus' personal unit.
the monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an
ordered symmetrical one.

                         tank
          when it does, morpheus will tell
          them anything they want to know.

                         neo
          what do they want?

                         tank
          every leader of every ship is given
          the codes to zion's mainframe
          computer which can be accessed only
          through the matrix.  they are used
          only in emergencies.  if an agent
          had those codes and got inside
          zion's mainframe they could disable
          the entire defense system.  it would
          be the end of everything.

he looks up at trinity who is pacing relentlessly.

                         tank
          we can't let that happen, trinity.
          zion has to be protected.
