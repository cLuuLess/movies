int.  stairwell - day

flying downstairs, morpheus stops, hearing police swarming
below.  he turns and rushes down the hall of the eight
floor.  at the end of it, he finds the bricked up windows.

                         cypher
          that's what they changed.  we're
          trapped.  there's no way out.

the sound of heavy bootsteps close around them with the
mechanical sureness of a vice.

                         morpheus
          give me your phone.

                         trinity
          they'll be able to track it.

                         morpheus
          we have no choice.
