int.  main deck

trinity sees cypher's dead body.  rage overtakes her and
she kicks him.

                         trinity
          goddamnit!  goddamnit!

                         neo
          there has to be something that we
          can do.

                         tank
          there is.  we have to pull the plug.

                         trinity
          you're going to kill him?  kill
          morpheus?!

                         tank
          trinity, we don't have any other
          choice.

neo suddenly sees it perfectly clear, fate rushing at him
like an oncoming train.

tank kneels beside morpheus' body.

                         tank
          morpheus, you were more than our
          leader.  you were... our father.  we
          will miss you, always.

trinity can't bear to watch.  as she closes her eyes, her
tears slip free.

tank takes hold of the plug.

neo is paralyzed, his whole life is suddenly suspended by
the finality of this moment hurling at him with the speed
of a bullet.

tank closes his eyes --

                         neo
          stop!

they both look at him.

                         neo
          goddamnit!  i don't believe this is
          happening!

                         tank
          neo, this has to be done!

                         neo
          does it?  i don't know.  this can't
          be just coincidence.  it can't be!
          can it?

                         tank
          what are you talking about?

                         neo
          the oracle.  she told me this would
          happen.  she told me...

neo stops, his stare fixed on morpheus.

                         neo
          that i would have to make a
          choice...

                         trinity
          what choice?

he makes his choice.  turning, he walks to his chair.

                         trinity
          what are you doing?

                         neo
          i'm going in after him.

                         trinity
          you can't!

                         neo
          i have to.

                         trinity
          morpheus sacrificed himself so we
          could get you out!  there's no way
          you're going back in!

                         neo
          morpheus did what he did because he
          believed that i'm something i'm not.

                         trinity
          what?

                         neo
          i'm not the one, trinity.  the
          oracle hit me with that too.

trinity is stunned.

                         trinity
          no, you... have to be.

                         neo
          i'm sorry, i'm not.  i'm just
          another guy.  morpheus is the one
          that matters.

                         trinity
          no, neo.  that's not true.  it can't
          be true.

                         neo
          why?

                         trinity
          because...

uncertainty swallows her words and she is unable to tell
him what she wants to.

                         tank
          neo, this is loco.  they've got
          morpheus in a military-controlled
          building.  even if you somehow got
          inside, those are agents holding
          him.  three of them!  i want
          morpheus back, too, but what you are
          talking about is suicide.

                         neo
          i know that's what it looks like,
          but it's not.  i can't logically
          explain to you why it's not.
          morpheus believed something and he
          was ready to give his life for what
          he believed.  i understand that now.
          that's why i have to go.

                         tank
          why?

                         neo
          because i believe in something.

                         trinity
          what?

                         neo
          i believe i can bring him back.

trinity stares at him, hovering on the edge that he just
jumped off.  her jaw sets and she starts climbing into the
chair beside him.

                         neo
          what are you doing?

                         trinity
          i'm coming with you.

                         neo
          no, you're not.

                         trinity
          no?  let me tell you what i believe.
          i believe morpheus means more to me
          than he does to you.  i believe that
          if you are serious about saving him
          then you are going to need my help
          and since i am the ranking officer
          on this ship, if you don't like it
          then i believe that you can go to
          hell, because you aren't going
          anywhere else.

there is nothing more to say except --

                         trinity
          tank, load us up.
