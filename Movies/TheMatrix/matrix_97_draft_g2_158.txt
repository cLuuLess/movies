int.  hall - day

marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof,
are beginning to panic when agent jones comes around the
corner.

                         sergeant
          sir!  sir!  there was gunfire --
          we've lost communication with the
          roof!

                         agent jones
          remain at your posts.

                         sergeant
          but, sir -- the fire -- we should
          evacuate!

                         agent jones
          you will do as you are ordered!
