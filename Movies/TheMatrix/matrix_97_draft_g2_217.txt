int.  hovercraft

in the still darkness, only the humans are alive.

                         trinity
          neo?

his eyes open.  tears pour from her smiling eyes as he
reaches up to touch her.

and she kisses him; it seems like it might last forever.

                                            fade to black.

fade in:

close on computer screen

as in the opening.  the cursor beating steadily, waiting.

a phone begins to ring.

it is answered and the screen fills instantly with the
trace program.  after a long beat, we recognize neo's
voice.

                         neo (v.o.)
          hi.  it's me.  i know you're out
          there.  i can feel you now.

we close in on the racing columns of numbers shimmering
across the screen.

                         neo (v.o.)
          i imagine you can also feel me.

we dive through the numbers, surging up through the
darkness, sucked towards a tight constellation of stars.

                         neo (v.o.)
          i know you're real proud of this
          world you've built, the way it
          works, all the nice little rules and
          such, but i've got some bad news.

we realize that the constellation is actually the holes in
the mouthpiece of a phone.  seen from inside.

                         neo (v.o.)
          i've decided to make a few changes.

we shoot through the holes as neo hangs up the phone.

he steps out of the phone booth and slides on a pair of
sunglasses.  he looks up and we rise.

higher...

... and higher, until the city is miles below.

after a moment, neo blasts by us, his long black coat
billowing like a black leather cape as he flies faster
then a speeding bullet.

                                            fade out.

                         THE END
