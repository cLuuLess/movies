          morpheus!  the line was traced!  i
          don't know how.

                         morpheus (man) (v.o.)
          i know.  they cut the hardline.
          this line is not a viable exit.

                         trinity
          are they any agent?

                         morpheus (v.o.)
          yes.

                         morpheus (v.o.)
          you have to focus.  there is a
          phone.  wells and lake.  you can
          make it.

she takes a deep breath, centering herself.

                         trinity
          all right --

                         morpheus (v.o.)
          go.

she drops the phone.
