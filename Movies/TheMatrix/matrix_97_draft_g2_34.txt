int.  neo's room

neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  he is
wearing a black tank top and shorts.

he begins to examine himself.  there is a futuristic iv
plugged into the jack in his forearm.  he pulls it out,
staring at the grafted outlet.

he feels his bald head.  his fingers find and explore the
large outlet in the base of his skull.

just as he starts to come unglued, morpheus opens the
door.

                         neo
          morpheus, what's happened to me?
          what is this place?

                         morpheus
          more important than what is when?

                         neo
          when?

                         morpheus
          you believe the year is 1997 when in
          fact it is much closer to 2197.  i
          can't say for certain what year it
          is because we honestly do not know.

the wind is knocked from neo's chest.

                         morpheus
          there is no reason for me to try to
          explain it when i can simple show
          it.  come with me.
