we have no sense of time.  we hear voices whispering.

                         morpheus (o.s.)
          we found him, trinity.  we finally
          found him.

                         trinity (o.s.)
          what if he isn't the one, morpheus?
          how can you be so sure?


neo's pov

neo's eyes flutter open.  we see morpheus' face above us,
angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.

                         neo (o.s.)
          ... am i dead?

                         morpheus
          far from it.

                                            fade to black.

fade in:

neo

he opens his eyes again, something tingling through him.
he focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of
acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.

                         dozer
          he needs a lot of work.

                         morpheus
          i know.

dozer and morpheus are operating on neo.

                         neo
          what are you doing?

                         morpheus
          your muscles have atrophied.  we're
          rebuilding them.

fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.

                         neo
          why do my eyes hurt?

                         morpheus
          you've never used them before.

morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on neo.
neo lays back.

                         morpheus
          rest, neo.  the answers are coming.
