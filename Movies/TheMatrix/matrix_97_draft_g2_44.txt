int.  main deck

neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension
chairs.

                         tank
          we're supposed to load all these
          operations programs first, but this
          is some major boring shit.  why
          don't we start with something a
          little fun?

tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  he
begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro
discs.

                         tank
          how about some combat training?

neo reads the label on the disk.

                         neo
          jujitsu?  i'm going to learn
          jujitsu?

tank slides the disk into neo's supplement drive.

                         neo
          no way.

smiling, tank punches the "load" code.

his body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp shut.
the monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds, adrenaline
surges, and his brain sizzles.

an instant later his eyes snap open.

                         neo
          holy shit!

                         tank
          hey, mikey, he likes it!  ready for
          more?

                         neo
          hell yes!
