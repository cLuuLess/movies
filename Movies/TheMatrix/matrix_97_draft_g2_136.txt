int.  main deck

trinity's eyes snap open, a sense of relief surging
through her at the sight of the ship.  as tank unplugs
her, she sees his charred wounds.

                         trinity
          tank, you're hurt.

                         tank
          i'll be all right.

                         trinity
          dozer?

tank's face tightens.

                         trinity
          i'm sorry, tank.
