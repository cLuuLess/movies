int.  kitchen

an old woman is huddled beside the oven, peering inside
through a cracked door.

                         neo
          hello?

                         oracle (old woman)
          i know.  you're neo.  be right with
          you.

                         neo
          you're the oracle?

                         oracle
          bingo.  not quite what you were
          expecting, right?  i got to say i
          love seeing you non-believers.
          always a pip.  almost done.  smell
          good, don't they?

                         neo
          yeah.

                         oracle
          i'd ask you to sit down, but you're
          not going to anyway.  and don't
          worry about the vase.

                         neo
          what vase?

he turns to look around and his elbow knocks a vase from
the table.  it breaks against the linoleum floor.

                         oracle
          that vase.

                         neo
          shit, i'm sorry.

she pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.
she is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts, comfortable
slacks and a print blouse.  she looks like someone's
grandma.

                         oracle
          i said don't worry about it.  i'll
          get one of my kids to fix it.

                         neo
          how did you know...?

she sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot pad.

                         oracle
          what's really going to bake your
          noodle later on is, would you still
          have broken it if i hadn't said
          anything.

smiling, she lights a cigarette.

                         oracle
          you're cuter than i thought.  i see
          why she likes you.

                         neo
          who?

                         oracle
          not too bright though.

she winks.

                         oracle
          you know why morpheus brought you to
          see me?

he nods.

                         oracle
          so?  what do you think?  you think
          you're the one?

                         neo
          honestly?  i don't know.

she gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every kitchen
has, except that the words are in latin.

                         oracle
          you know what that means?  it's
          latin.  means, 'know thyself'.  i'm
          gonna let you in on a little secret.
          being the one is just like being in
          love.  nobody can tell you you're in
          love.  you just know it.  through
          and through.  balls to bones.

she puts her cigarette down.

                         oracle
          well, i better have a look at you.

she widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the
glands in his neck.

                         oracle
          open your mouth.  say 'ahh'.

she nods then looks at his palms.

                         oracle
          okay, now i'm supposed to say,
          'hmmm, that's interesting but...'
          then you say --

                         neo
          but what?

                         oracle
          but you already know what i'm going
          to tell you.

                         neo
          i'm not the one.

                         oracle
          sorry, kid.  you got the gift but
          looks like you're waiting for
          something.

                         neo
          what?

                         oracle
          your next life, maybe.  who knows.
          that's how these things go.

neo almost has to laugh.

                         oracle
          what's funny?

                         neo
          morpheus.  he almost had me
          convinced.

                         oracle
          i know.  poor morpheus.  without him
          we are lost.  we will never find the
          one.

                         neo
          what do you mean, without him?

the oracle takes a long drag, regarding neo with the eyes
of a sphinx.

                         oracle
          are you sure you want to hear this?

neo nods.

                         oracle
          morpheus believes in you, neo and no
          one, not you or even me can convince
          him otherwise.  he believes it so
          blindly that he's going to sacrifice
          his life to save yours.

                         neo
          what?

                         oracle
          you're going to have to make a final
          choice.  in one hand, you will have
          morpheus' life.  in the other hand,
          you will have your own.  one of you
          is going to die.  which one, will be
          up to you.

neo can't breathe.

                         oracle
          i'm sorry, kiddo.  i really am.  you
          have a good soul and i hate giving
          good people bad news.  but don't
          worry, as soon as you walk outside
          that door, you'll start feeling
          better.  you'll remember that you
          don't believe any of this fate crap.
          you're in control of your own life,
          remember?

he tries to nod as she reaches for the tray of cookies.

                         oracle
          here, take a cookie.  i promise by
          the time you're done eating it,
          you'll feel right as rain.

neo takes a cookie, the tightness in his chest slowly
beginning to fade.
