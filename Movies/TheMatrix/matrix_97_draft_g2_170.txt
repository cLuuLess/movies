int.  subway - old man's pov - day

through the old man's eyes as the world begins to rumble.


trinity

hangs up the phone, then turns to neo.

                         trinity
          neo, i have to tell you something.
          i don't know what it means or even
          if it matters but i feel i have to
          say it.

the rumble grows, the ground beginning to shake.

                         trinity
          i've never told anyone this before.
          i think i've been afraid to.

behind her, the phone begins to ring.

                         trinity
          when i went to the oracle, she told
          me... she told me that i would meet
          a man.  and that i would fall in
          love...

the rumble rises, drowning her voice.  neo is drawn
towards her, their lips close enough to kiss when a train
blasts into the station.

for a moment, they are frozen by the strobing lights of
the train until neo whispers in her ear.

                         neo
          promise me you'll tell me the rest?

she nods as he closes the booth.  the phone rings once
more before she lifts the receiver when --

in the darkness of the far corner, neo sees the old man in
the flashing train-light as he becomes --

agent smith, raising a fistful of black gun-metal.

                         neo
          no!

the gun fires, the bullet flying at her, bursting through
the plastic window just as --

trinity disappears.

the headset hanging in the air as the bullet hits,
shattering the ear-piece.
