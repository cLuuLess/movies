neo whip-draws his gun flashpoint speed of lightning as --

smith opens fire.

gun report thunders through the underground, both men
blasting, moving at impossible speed.

for a blinking moment we enter bullet-time.

gun flash tongues curl from neo's gun, bullets float
forward like a plane moving across the sky, cartridges
cartwheel into space.

an instant later they are nearly on top of each other,
rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
reflection of the other --

each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.

they freeze in a kind of embrace; neo sweating, panting,
agent smith machine-calm.

agent smith smiles.

                         agent smith
          you're empty.

neo pulls the trigger.  click.

                         neo
          so are you.

the smile falls.  agent smith yanks his trigger.

click.

agent smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fists
flying at furious speed, blows and counters, neo
retreating as --

a knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him
slamming back against a steel column.

stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into
the beam, steel chunks exploding like shrapnel.
