int.  chase hotel

the big cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding a
bead.  they've done this a hundred times, they know
they've got her, until the big cop reaches with the cuffs
and trinity moves --

it almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly
fast.

the eye blinks and trinity's palm snaps up and his nose
explodes, blood erupting.  her leg kicks with the force of
a wrecking ball and he flies back, a two-hundred-fifty
pound sack of limp meat and bone that slams into the cop
farthest from her.

trinity moves again, bullets raking the walls, flashlights
sweeping with panic as the remaining cops try to stop a
leather-clad ghost.

a gun still in the cop's hand is snatched, twisted and
fired.  there is a final violent exchange of gunfire and
when it's over, trinity is the only one standing.

a flashlight rocks slowly to a stop.

                         trinity
          shit.
