behind him, neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-
snapping reverse round-house.  agent smith's glasses fly
off and he glares at neo; his eyes ice blue.

                         agent smith
          i'm going to enjoy watching you die,
          mr. anderson.

agent smith attacks with unrelenting fury, fists pounding
neo like jackhammers.
