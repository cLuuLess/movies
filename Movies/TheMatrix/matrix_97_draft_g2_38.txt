ext.  fetus fields

on the flash, we pull back from the darkness which reveals
itself to be the black eye of a fetus.

                         morpheus
          the machines discovered a new form
          of fusion.  all they needed was a
          small electrical charge to initiate
          the reaction.

the fetus is suspended in a placenta-like husk, where its
malleable skull is already growing around the brain-jack.

                         morpheus
          the human body generates more
          bioelectricity than a 120-volt
          battery and over 25,000 b.t.u.'s of
          body heat.

the husk hanging from a stalk is plucked by a thresher-
like farm machine.

                         morpheus
          for the longest time, i wouldn't
          believe it.  but then i saw the
          fields with my own eyes, spreading
          in every direction for miles.
          inside the power plant, i watched
          them liquefy the dead so they could
          be fed intravenously to the living
          and standing there, facing the
          efficiency, the pure, horrifying
          precision, i came to realize the
          obviousness of the truth.

still pulling back, we see the image of the field now on
the television as we return to the white space of the
construct.
