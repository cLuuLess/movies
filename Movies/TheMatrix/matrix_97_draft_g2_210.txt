int.  hall - day

holding his chest, neo struggles to get up.  at the end of
the hall, the agents wait for the elevator when agent
smith glances back.  he rips off his sunglasses looking at
neo as if he were looking at a ghost.

neo gets to his feet, all three agents grabbing for their
guns.  as one, they fire.

                         neo
          no!

neo raises his hands and the bullets, like a cloud of
obedient bees, slow and come to a stop.  they hang frozen
in space, fixed like stainless steel stars.

the agents are unable to absorb what they are seeing.

neo plucks one of the bullets from the air.  we see him
and the hall reflected in the bright casing.  we move
closer until the bullet fills our vision and the distorted
reflection morphs, becoming the "real" image.

he drops the bullet and the others fall to the floor.

neo looks out, now able to see through the curtain of the
matrix.  for a moment, the walls, the floor, even the
agents become a rushing stream of code.
