int.  cockpit

neo leans into trinity's ear.

                         neo
          e.m.p.  an electromagnetic pulse.

                         trinity
          it disables any electrical system in
          the blast radius.  it's the only
          weapon we have against the machines.

through the cockpit's windshield, the vast cavern of the
sewer main yawns before them.  strands of green haze curl
around mossy icicles that dangle into a pool of churning
frozen waste.

neo begins to angle around dozer but morpheus grabs him.

                         morpheus
          don't move.  it'll hear you.

neo freezes and they wait.

without the nebuchadnezzar's heating systems, the
temperature in the cockpit begins to rapidly drop.  the
crew members huddle together, their breath freezing into a
uniform cloud as it gets colder and colder.

dozer quietly reaches to brush away the frost on the
windshield and as his hand clears a swathe --

they see it.

in the darkness, a shifting shadow of mechanized death.
it is beautiful and terrifying.  black alloy skin flickers
like sequins beneath sinewy coils and skeletal appendages.

neo can feel the hairs on the back of his neck rise as it
silently glides over them with shark-like malevolence
until it disappears into the darkness.

in the frozen little room, everyone breathes a little
easier.
