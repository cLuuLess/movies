ext.  city street

neo springs from the gangway, head swiveling in all
directions.

                         neo
          which way?  which way?

                         tank (v.o.)
          duck!

he ducks as a swarm of bullets chew into the brick wall
behind him and spring full bore down the street, agent
smith right behind him.

                         tank (v.o.)
          go straight!

neo hauls ass, juking, ducking and diving, feet hardly
touching the ground.

                         tank (v.o.)
          watch for those girl scouts!

agent jones emerges from a bus full of girl scouts that
are unloading on his right.

neo veers left as agent brown rises from behind a
newspaper up ahead.

                         tank (v.o.)
          left!  take a left!

he does, finding himself in an open market --

that teems with people.

neo screams and kamikazes his way down the little avenues
lined with vendors and shops.

he careens through the labyrinth, out of control.  and at
every turn there is an agent; appearing from crowds,
behind fish counters, tent flaps, and crates.

neo spins.  he can't shake them.  they are everywhere.

he dives from the maze down a service alley.
