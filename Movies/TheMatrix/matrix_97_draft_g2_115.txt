int.  basement - day

this part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was the
main mechanical room.  there are four enormous boilers,
dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot water like
arteries.

apoc is the first to smash through in a hail of dirt and
plaster, landing in the middle of an enemy search unit.
apoc doesn't let them suffer too long.

immediately, he is on them, a long blade flashing in his
hand in wide, bloody electric arcs, feet kicking, bones
breaking.

switch drops next to him from the wet wall.  whipping out
small, full automatic machine guns, she begins laying down
cover fire as more men surround them.

blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked
figures fire grenade launchers.

smoke blossoms from the green metal canisters.

trinity never stops moving.  searching the floor, she
finds what she needs; the cover of the catch basin.

cypher watches her pry open the grate, when a gas can
bounces near him.

                         trinity
          come on!

cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.

trinity watches cypher disappear into the smoke, then
follows the others down the wet-black hole.
