int.  executive office - day

agent smith stands, staring out the windows at the city
below shimmering with brilliant sunlight.

                         agent smith
          have you ever stood and stared at
          it, morpheus?  marveled at its
          beauty.  its genius.  billions of
          people just living out their
          lives... oblivious.

morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist.
he is alternately shivering and sweating, wired to various
monitors with white disk electrodes.  beside him, agent
brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a
hypodermic needle.

                         agent smith
          did you know that the first matrix
          was designed to be a perfect human
          world?  where none suffered, where
          everyone would be happy.  it was a
          disaster.  no one would accept the
          program.  entire crops were lost.

agent brown jams the needle into morpheus' shoulder and
plunges down.

                         agent smith
          some believed we lacked the
          programming language to describe
          your perfect world.  but i believe
          that, as a species, human beings
          define their reality through
          suffering and misery.

agent brown studies the screens as the life signs react
violently to the injection.

                         agent smith
          the perfect world was a dream that
          your primitive cerebrum kept trying
          to wake up from.  which is why the
          matrix was redesigned to this:  the
          peak of your civilization.

he turns from the window.

                         agent smith
          i say 'your civilization' because as
          soon as we started thinking for you,
          it really became our civilization,
          which is, of course, what this is
          all about.

he sits down directly in front of morpheus.

                         agent smith
          evolution, morpheus.  evolution.

he lifts morpheus' head.

                         agent smith
          like the dinosaur.  look out that
          window.  you had your time.

morpheus stares hard at him, trying not to show the pain
racking his mind.

                         agent smith
          the future of your world, morpheus.
          the future is our time.

agent smith looks at agent brown.

                         agent smith
          double the dosage.

agent jones suddenly enters.

                         agent jones
          we could have a problem.
