ext.  city street - training program - day

morpheus moves effortlessly through a crowded downtown
street while neo struggles to keep up, constantly bumped
and shouldered off the path.

                         morpheus
          this is another matrix simulation.
          a training program to help you get
          your sea legs and teach you one very
          important lesson.

                         neo
          what -- what lesson?

neo collides with a man who looks just like rhineheart.

                         morpheus
          the matrix is a system, neo, and
          that system is our enemy.  when you
          look around, what do you see?
          businessmen, lawyers, students.
          people.  everywhere you look, there
          are people.  somewhere else,
          somewhere in the future they may be
          human beings but here these people
          are a part of the system.  that
          makes every one of them our enemy.

a beautiful woman in a red dress smiles at neo as she
passes by.

                         morpheus
          it is important to understand that
          if you are not one of us, you are
          one of them.

morpheus stops, turning to neo.

                         morpheus
          do you understand, neo?

                         neo
          i think i do.

                         morpheus
          no you don't.  did you see the woman
          in the red dress?

                         neo
          yeah.

                         morpheus
          look again.

neo turns just as agent smith levels a gun at his face --

neo screams.

                         morpheus
          freeze it.

everything except morpheus and neo freezes.

                         morpheus
          the agents are sentient programs.
          they can enter any software that is
          hardwired to the system.  they can
          become anyone who is still a captive
          of the matrix.  if the matrix is a
          prison, then the agents are its
          wardens and if humankind is to
          survive they first must be stopped.

neo listens to his intense voice.

                         morpheus
          every attempt to fight them has
          ended in failure.  only a handful of
          men and women have ever crossed an
          agent and lived because they are
          everyone and they are no one.
          unkillable.  but now i believe that
          is going to change.

                         neo
          how?

                         morpheus
          i've seen an agent punch through a
          concrete wall.  men have emptied
          entire clips at them and hit noting
          but air.  yet as powerful as they
          are, their speed and strength are
          but tethers to the rules of an
          unreal world.  because of this, they
          will never be as strong or as fast
          as you can be.

neo scratches his head.

                         neo
          what?  are you trying to tell me
          that i can dodge bullets?

                         morpheus
          no, neo.  i'm trying to tell you
          that when you're ready, you won't
          have to.

morpheus' cell phone rings and he flips it open.

                         tank (v.o.)
          we got trouble.
