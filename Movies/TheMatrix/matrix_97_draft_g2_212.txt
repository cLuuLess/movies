int.  hall

agent smith screams, his calm machine-like expression
shredding with pure rage.

he rushes neo.  his attack is ferocious but neo blocks
each blow easily.  then with one quick strike to the chest
he sends agent smith flying backwards.

for the first time since their inception, the agents know
fear.

agent smith gets up and attacks again but as he lunges,
neo disappears.

spinning around he looks to the others and feels
something, like a tremor before a quake, something deep,
something that is going to change everything.

suddenly a searing sound stabs through his earpiece as his
chest begins to swell, then balloon as --

neo bursts up out of him.  agent smith screams, fighting
what seems inevitable as neo absorbs and envelops him,
overtaking smith as if he were now an agent, until --

only neo is left.

neo faces the remaining agents.  they look at each other,
the same idea striking simultaneously --

they run.
