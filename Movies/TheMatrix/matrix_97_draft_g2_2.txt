int.  chase hotel - night

the hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across
the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it
spooled soot up the walls and ceiling, leaving patterns of
permanent shadow.

we follow four armed police officers using flashlights as
they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves on
either side of room 303.

the biggest of them violently kicks in the door --

the other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
them.

                         big cop
          police!  freeze!

the room is almost devoid of furniture.  there is a fold-
up table and chair with a phone, a modem, and a powerbook
computer.  the only light in the room is the glow of the
computer.

sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is
trinity; a woman in black leather.

                         big cop
          hands behind your head!  now!  do
          it!

she slowly puts her hands behind her head.
