int.  government building - day

in long black coats, trinity and neo push through the
revolving doors.

neo is carrying a duffel bag.  trinity has a large metal
suitcase.  they cut across the lobby to the security
station, drawing nervous glances.

dark glasses, game faces.

neo calmly passes through the metal detector which begins
to wail immediately.

a security guard moves over toward neo, raising his metal
detection wand.

                         guard
          would you please remove any metallic
          items you are carrying:  keys, loose
          change --

neo slowly sets down his duffel bag and throws open his
coat, revealing an arsenal of guns, knives, and grenades
slung from a climbing harness.

                         guard
          holy shit --

neo and trinity are a blur of motion.  in a split second,
three guards are dead before they hit the ground.

chaos erupts; bystanders run for cover, popping caps
echoing in the stark official lobby.

a second wave of plainclothes cops and guards try to stop
them.  they are met by the muted spit of a silenced gun
and the razored whistle of throwing stars.

weapons like extensions of their bodies, are used with the
same deadly precision as their feet and their fists.

bodies slump down to the marbled floor while neo and
trinity hardly even break their stride.
