int.  main deck

they break up.

                         mouse
          what does it mean?

                         switch
          it doesn't mean anything.

                         cypher
          everyone falls the first time,
          right, trinity?

but trinity has already left.

neo's eyes open as tank eases the plug out.  he tries to
move and groans, cradling his ribs.

while tank helps morpheus, neo spits blood into his hand.

                         neo
          i thought it wasn't real.

                         morpheus
          your mind makes it real.

neo stares at the blood.

                         neo
          if you are killed in the matrix, you
          die here?

                         morpheus
          the body cannot live without the
          mind.
